Unfortunately, in order to save his funding, he was forced to enter the accelerator prematurely and vanished. He then found himself in someone else's body with partial amnesia. His only contact from home is Al, a holographic image only he can see and hear. Setting right things which once went wrong, Sam leaps from life to life, hoping each time that this is the final leap home.\n\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English\nFormat: MKV\nEpisodes: 97\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE DOWNLOAD AND CONTINUE TO SEED, THANKS COURTESY OF UNOFFICIALMILLS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeab34a8714b8501453d5c2c7081e7ba88212a91","amp;dn":"Quantum+Leap+Complete+Set+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeab34a8714b8501453d5c2c7081e7ba88212a91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,171,52,168,113,75,133,1,69,61,92,44,112,129,231,186,136,33,42,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
