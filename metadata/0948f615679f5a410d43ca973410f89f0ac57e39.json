Gooch.pdf\n\nISBN 0-306-45541-2\n\nThis practical resource provides chemists, formulators, forensic scientists, teachers, and students with the latest information on the composition of polymeric materials. After a discussion of principles, chapters cover formulations, materials, and analysis of paint, plastic, and adhesives and describe reformulation methods to test analysis results. A detailed table of contents and extensive index with listings of relevant materials allows readers easy access to topics. Other features include various materials listed according to their trivial, trade, and scientific names cross-referenced for easy identification","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0948f615679f5a410d43ca973410f89f0ac57e39","amp;dn":"Analysis+and+Deformulation+of+Polymeric+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0948f615679f5a410d43ca973410f89f0ac57e39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,72,246,21,103,159,90,65,13,67,202,151,52,16,248,159,10,197,126,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
