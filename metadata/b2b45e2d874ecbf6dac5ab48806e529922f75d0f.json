Over thirty million perished in a grain shortage brought on not by flood, drought, or infestation, but by the insanely irresponsible dictates of Chairman Mao Ze-dong's &quot;Great Leap Forward,&quot; an attempt at utopian engineering gone horribly wrong.\r\n\r\nJournalist Jasper Becker conducted hundreds of interviews and spent years immersed in painstaking detective work to produce Hungry Ghosts, the first full account of this dark chapter in Chinese history. In this horrific story of state-sponsored terror, cannibalism, torture, and murder, China's communist leadership boasted of record harvests and actually increased grain exports, while refusing imports and international assistance. With China's reclamation of Hong Kong now a fait accompli, removing the historical blinders is more timely than ever. As reviewer Richard Bernstein wrote in the New York Times, &quot;Mr. Becker's remarkable book...strikes a heavy blow against willed ignorance of what took place.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b45e2d874ecbf6dac5ab48806e529922f75d0f","amp;dn":"Hungry+Ghosts%3A+Mao%27s+Secret+Famine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b45e2d874ecbf6dac5ab48806e529922f75d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,180,94,45,135,78,203,246,218,197,171,72,128,110,82,153,34,247,93,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
