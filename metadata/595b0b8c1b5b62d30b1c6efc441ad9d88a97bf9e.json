If you know the basics of C programming, this guide will ease you into the world of embedded ARM technology. With clear explanations of the systems common to all ARM processors and step-by-step instructions for creating an embedded application, it prepares you for this popular specialty.\n\nWhile ARM technology is not new, existing books on the topic predate the current explosive growth of mobile devices using ARM and don't cover these all-important aspects. Newcomers to embedded technology will find this guide approachable and easy to understand.\n\nCovers the tools required, assembly and debugging techniques, C optimizations, and more\nLists the tools needed for various types of projects and explores the details of the assembly language\nExamines the optimizations that can be made to ensure fast code\nProvides step-by-step instructions for a basic application and shows how to build upon it\n\nProfessional Embedded ARM Development prepares you to enter this exciting and in-demand programming field.\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nLaunch into the world of embedded systems development\n\nWhether it's an iPad, Surface tablet, iPhone or Nintendo DS, ARM is the microprocessor technology that helps run them all. These ARM-based processors offer powerful number-crunching capabilities while using very little energy, making them perfect for mobile devices. This guide gets you started in the world of embedded ARM development, walking you through the different systems common to every ARM processor. It explores the basics of ARM embedded development, including a brief tour of the processors, the programming language used by the processor, and numerous programming examples. Following its step-by-step details, you'll quickly create your first embedded application.\n\nProfessional Embedded ARM Development:\n\nEases you into the world of embedded ARM development by clearly explaining the different systems common to every ARM processor\nExamines the tools required for developing on ARM systems, including boards, software, and references\nGets you up to speed on the assembly language so you can begin low-level system programming and debugging\nShows how to perform optimizations to ensure fast code to get the most out of an ARM processor\n\nWrox Professional guides are written by working developers to address everyday needs. They provide examples, practical solutions, and expert education in new technologies, all designed to help programmers do a better job.\nAbout the Author\n\nJames A. Langbridge is an R&amp;D Engineering consultant. In his role as an embedded systems consultant, he helps people and companies develop ARM-based systems and optimize code. He has been working in embedded systems for over 10 years in the aviation, defense, industry, and telecom sectors.
