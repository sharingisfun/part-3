While recuperating, she is introduced to President Alma Coin, the rebel leader, and is told that her actions in the arena sparked riots and strikes against the Capitol. Coin asks her if she will become the &quot;Mockingjay&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€the symbol of the rebellionÃ¢â‚¬â€as part of their &quot;hearts and minds&quot; strategy. Katniss flatly declines, angrily reminding her that they left Peeta Mellark, her portrayed lover and fellow District 12 tribute, behind in the arena. At the suggestion of Plutarch Heavensbee, the former Gamemaker, she is taken to see the ruins of District 12, which was completely leveled by a Capitol bombing campaign (with the exception of the houses in the Victor's Village). After seeing that Peeta is being used by Capitol state television to try and quell the rebellion, Katniss reluctantly changes her mind and agrees to become Coin's Mockingjay, on the condition that Peeta and the other victors will be rescued, and pardoned, at the earliest opportunity.\n\nAfter Haymitch notes that Katniss thrives on spontaneity, she is introduced to her film team (led by Capitol escapee Cressida), is dressed up in a specially-designed outfit, and given Effie Trinket as a stylist and close friend Gale as a bodyguard. They go out to District 8 to visit a hospital, but as the visit concludes, a Capitol bombing squadron arrives and bombs the hospital, killing everyone inside. In her rage, Katniss gives a rousing speech to the camera, which is broadcast when Beetee hijacks the Capitol's news feed. The team then go back to District 12, where Gale tells the story of its destruction, and Katniss is filmed singing &quot;The Hanging Tree.&quot; After both are broadcast, strikers in District 7 kill an entire team of Peacekeepers with hidden land mines, and a rebel demolition team destroys the dam providing the Capitol with electricity, forcing them to use power generators and weakening their ability to broadcast their propaganda.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f5f5c8fd04bd7fd5d07911656f4db1e1b480c8","amp;dn":"The+Hunger+Games+Mockingjay+-+Part+1+%282014%29+CAM.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f5f5c8fd04bd7fd5d07911656f4db1e1b480c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,245,245,200,253,4,189,127,213,208,121,17,101,111,77,177,225,180,128,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
