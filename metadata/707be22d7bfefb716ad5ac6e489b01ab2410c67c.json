Just fallow the steps below.\n1: Shut down Gmod not required to exit Steam.\n2: Navigate to you GarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mod Game Folder.\nUsual Directory: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ C:Program Files (x86)Steamsteamappssteamidgarrysmodgarrysmod Ã¢â‚¬Å“\n3: Unpack all of the RAR files to your desktop \nDo it this way since some versions of Windows will not allow permission for the archive program ( WinRar / 7Zip) to load files directly to the C: drive and my just error without any signs of why. This has happened before so you were just warned!\n4: Copy the extracted folders one by one to the garrysmod folder. Make sure to combine any existing folders with the same name and to copy and replace any existing files when prompted to do so.\n5: Start Gmod and Play there are no additional settings to change.\nIf this helped you Please tell a friend Thank You\nAnd donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707be22d7bfefb716ad5ac6e489b01ab2410c67c","amp;dn":"CSS+Props+and+files+for+Gmod+13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707be22d7bfefb716ad5ac6e489b01ab2410c67c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,123,226,45,123,254,251,113,106,213,172,110,72,155,1,171,36,16,198,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
