Jacobsen (Wiley, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nNMR Spectroscopy Explained : Simplified Theory, Applications and Examples for Organic Chemistry and Structural Biology provides a fresh, practical guide to NMR for both students and practitioners, in a clearly written and non-mathematical format. It gives the reader an intermediate level theoretical basis for understanding laboratory applications, developing concepts gradually within the context of examples and useful experiments.\r\n\r\nIntroduces students to modern NMR as applied to analysis of organic compounds.\r\nPresents material in a clear, conversational style that is appealing to students.\r\nContains comprehensive coverage of how NMR experiments actually work.\r\nCombines basic ideas with practical implementation of the spectrometer.\r\nProvides an intermediate level theoretical basis for understanding laboratory experiments.\r\nDevelops concepts gradually within the context of examples and useful experiments.\r\nIntroduces the product operator formalism after introducing the simpler (but limited) vector model","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32dd8ba4b1fa56f2bd25a48c483fcfda8cbfafff","amp;dn":"NMR+Spectroscopy+Explained+-+Neil+E.+Jacobsen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32dd8ba4b1fa56f2bd25a48c483fcfda8cbfafff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,221,139,164,177,250,86,242,189,37,164,140,72,63,207,218,140,191,175,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
