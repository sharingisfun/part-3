This Qigong specializes in training the five internal Yin organs; heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen, which correspond to the four seasons the year.\n\nIt is believed that when we get sick it is often due to the bodyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s difficulty in adapting to the changes from one season to another. For example, when Fall arrives, it is easier to catch a cold, and when Summer comes, the heart can be too excited. By practicing Four Seasons Qigong, you are able to adjust your bodyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s Qi during the change of seasons so your health can be maintained.\n\nThis multi-language program is captured in High Definition, and builds on the theory taught in DVDs 1, 2, and 3. Dr. Yang's systematic approach to teaching offers deep insight into the ancient art of Qigong with modern scientific data to support his theory from both an Eastern and Western perspective.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ Dr. Yang instructs 25 qigong exercises &amp; explains the related healing sounds\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ Basic Five Elements theory and its relationship to the organs\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ Learn Four Seasons self-massage techniques\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ Understand how to use qigong to alleviate depression","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2ab80022c1598ea440400fd6416708753d6fa0c","amp;dn":"Understanding+Qi+Gong+-+Part+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2ab80022c1598ea440400fd6416708753d6fa0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,171,128,2,44,21,152,234,68,4,0,253,100,22,112,135,83,214,250,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
