Malleron et al. (AP, 1997).pdf\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive handbook will be an indispensable research tool for chemists. Handbook of Palladium Catalysed Organic Reactions provides a synoptic description of the main types of reactions which are catalyzed by Palladium and the mechanism which causes these reactions. Each reaction is presented in graphical form and classified according to the type of transformation involved.\r\nOther books covering the use of Palladium complexes as catalysts have been written, but the Handbook is the only to offer a synoptic view, showing the catalytic cycle of each reaction. This complete coverage provides the reader with a good understanding of the parameters involved. The tables included can be viewed from the point of view of the reagents, the product of the reaction, or the mechanism involved. The Handbook is a companion to the Database of Palladium Chemistry: Reactions andCatalytic Cycles, published on CD-ROM.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n* Begins with explicit instructions from the authors, facilitating use of the Handbook\r\n* Details the associated catalytic cycle for each class of reactions\r\n* Offers a choice of references, allowing the reader to find the closest example for solving a given problem\r\n* 84 types of mechanism covered, plus over 2500 references\r\n* Presents graphical abstracts for all reactions described, making it easy to search a type of reaction\r\n* Comb-bound for easy reference\r\n* Free demo disk included for the Database of Palladium Chemistry\r\n* A versatile tool for chemists in the academic community, this handbook will be an invaluable tool in the laboratory\r\n* 84 types of mechanism covered, plus over\r\n2500 references\r\n* Presents graphical abstracts for all reactions described, making it easy to search a type of reaction\r\n* Comb-bound for easy reference\r\n* Free demo disk included for the Database of\r\nPalladium Chemistry\r\n* A versatile tool for chemists in the academic community, this handbook will be an invaluable tool in the laboratory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b225f2b1bfe448a4bf9ab43ec876783369a7a8","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Palladium-Catalyzed+Organic+Reactions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b225f2b1bfe448a4bf9ab43ec876783369a7a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,178,37,242,177,191,228,72,164,191,154,180,62,200,118,120,51,105,167,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
