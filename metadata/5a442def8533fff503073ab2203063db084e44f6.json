This, combined with many overt literary allusions -- the Tolkeinisms of the title of &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot; only being the most apparent -- gives this album a storybook quality. It plays as a collection of short stories, fables, and fairy tales, and it is also a rock record, which naturally makes it quite extraordinary as a collection, but also as a set of individual songs. \n\nGenesis has never been as direct as they've been on the fanciful yet hook-driven &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; -- apart from the fluttering flutes in the fade-out, it could easily be mistaken for a glam single -- or as achingly fragile as on &quot;More Fool Me,&quot; sung by Phil Collins. It's this delicate balance and how the album showcases the band's narrative force on a small scale as well as large that makes this their arguable high-water mark.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
