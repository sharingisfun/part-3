It was originally devised as a double-LP set to accompany a film project, but when plans for the movie were scuttled, the band salvaged parts of its potential score as a ten-song, single-LP album. Other tracks were drawn from writing sessions for a never-released follow-up to 1972Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Thick as a Brick; another song dated as far back as the sessions for 1971Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Aqualung.\n\nThis new edition of WarChild is dubbed the 40th Anniversary Theatre Edition and includes on a second CD many orchestral pieces written for the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soundtrack, most of which are unissued until now. Alongside the orchestral pieces on the second disc set some Ã¢â‚¬Ëœassociated recordingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ from the original sessions.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e0403ddd049da87ca5d83072d61d1d6eda8585d","amp;dn":"Jethro+Tull+-+War+Child+%5BThe+40th+Anniversary+Edition%5D+%282014%29+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e0403ddd049da87ca5d83072d61d1d6eda8585d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,4,3,221,208,73,218,135,202,93,131,7,45,97,209,214,237,168,88,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
