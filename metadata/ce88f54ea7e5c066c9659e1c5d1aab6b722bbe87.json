With\n atmospheric arrangements and enhancements for stage presentation, The Snow Goose\n is not only a timeless story of love and war.  It is a tale of dignity and\n kindness lifted to the heart on the wings of an injured Snow Goose through her\n unique relationship with two humans. Written by Paul Gallico, this short story\n inspired this beautiful music.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting:                                                                     \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 01 - The Great Marsh                  [02:09]\n 02 - Rhayader                         [03:06]\n 03 - Rhayader Goes To Town            [05:28]\n 04 - Sanctuary (Revised Edition)      [02:57]\n 05 - Fritha                           [01:27]\n 06 - The Snow Goose                   [03:02]\n 07 - Friendship                       [01:50]\n 08 - Migration (Revised Edition)      [04:29]\n 09 - Rhayader Alone (Revised Edition) [03:24]\n 10 - Flight Of The Snow Goose         [02:27]\n 11 - Preparation                      [03:54]\n 12 - Dunkirk                          [05:39]\n 13 - Epitaph (Revised Edition)        [01:32]\n 14 - Fritha Alone                     [01:47]\n 15 - Princesse Perdue                 [05:18]\n 16 - The Great Marsh                  [01:35]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Enjoy !\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce88f54ea7e5c066c9659e1c5d1aab6b722bbe87","amp;dn":"Camel+-+The+Snow+Goose+%282013%29+%28Re-recording%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce88f54ea7e5c066c9659e1c5d1aab6b722bbe87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,136,245,78,167,229,192,102,201,101,158,28,93,26,171,107,114,43,190,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
