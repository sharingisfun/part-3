The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, following the trend of super-hero teams after the success of DC Comics' Justice League of America.\n\nLabeled Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers originally consisted of Iron Man, Ant-Man, the Wasp, Thor, and the Hulk. The original Captain America was discovered, trapped in ice (issue #4), and joined the group after they revived him. A rotating roster became a hallmark, although one theme remained consistent: the Avengers fight &quot;the foes no single superhero can withstand.&quot; The team, famous for its battle cry of &quot;Avengers Assemble!&quot;, has featured humans, mutants, robots, aliens, supernatural beings, and even former villains.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a654283ef5d3ba20286fbebf93ae11052e199d7a","amp;dn":"The+Avengers+%281963+-+2012%29%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a654283ef5d3ba20286fbebf93ae11052e199d7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,84,40,62,245,211,186,32,40,111,190,191,147,174,17,5,46,25,157,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
