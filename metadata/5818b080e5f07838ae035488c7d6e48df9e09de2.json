She was born Neneh Mariann Karlssson on March 10, 1964, in Stockholm, Sweden, the daughter of West African percussionist Ahmadu Jah and artist Moki Cherry. Raised by her mother and her trumpeter stepfather in both Stockholm and New York City, Cherry dropped out of school at age 14, and in 1980 she relocated to London to sing with the punk group the Cherries.\n\n  Following brief flings with the Slits and the Nails, she joined the experimental funk/post-punk outfit Rip Rig + Panic, and appeared on the group's albums God (1981), I Am Cold (1982), and Attitude (1983). When the band broke up, Cherry remained with one of the spinoff groups, Float Up CP, and led them through one album, 1986's Kill Me in the Morning. The band proved short-lived, however, and Cherry began rapping in a London club, where she earned the attention of a talent scout who signed her to a solo contract. Her first single, &quot;Stop the War,&quot; railed against the invasion of the Falkland Islands.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5818b080e5f07838ae035488c7d6e48df9e09de2","amp;dn":"Neneh+Cherry+-+Blank+Project+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5818b080e5f07838ae035488c7d6e48df9e09de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,24,176,128,229,240,120,56,174,3,84,136,199,214,228,141,249,224,157,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
