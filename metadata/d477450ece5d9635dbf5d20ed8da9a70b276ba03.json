She doesn't believe that the Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in\r\ndroves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop\r\nbombs upon the innocent. When a German captain requisitions Vianne's home, she and her\r\ndaughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger\r\nescalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her\r\nfamily alive.\r\nVianne's sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the\r\nreckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she\r\nmeets GÃ¤etan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she\r\nfalls in love as only the young can...completely. But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the\r\nResistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.\r\nWith courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic\r\npanorama of WWII and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women's war. The\r\nNightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion\r\nand circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in\r\nGerman-occupied, war-torn France--a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience\r\nof the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d477450ece5d9635dbf5d20ed8da9a70b276ba03","amp;dn":"The+Nightingale+by+Kristin+Hannah+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d477450ece5d9635dbf5d20ed8da9a70b276ba03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,119,69,14,206,93,150,53,219,245,210,14,216,218,154,112,178,118,186,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
