It must not be a 4x4 and must not be designed in any way to go off-road. Which could be a problem, since their task is then to drive across the wilds of Botswana, negotiating massive salt pans, treacherous rivers and reserves full of animals, most of which will want to eat them. Along the way they face fierce heat, suffocating dust and an encounter with the Stig's African cousin.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19.5 (~3856Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~144Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.67 GB\r\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aed1d759d6edf37761e886ff2277fa4cf164c3d","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.2007.Botswana.Special.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aed1d759d6edf37761e886ff2277fa4cf164c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,237,29,117,157,110,223,55,118,30,136,111,242,39,127,164,207,22,76,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
