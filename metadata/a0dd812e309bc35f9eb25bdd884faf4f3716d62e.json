Dance music's long had a fickle relationship with the album format, but Settle's impeccable sequencing leads to a record that begs to be heard in its entirety. Some of Settle's giddiest highlights are clear 2-step/UK garage callbacks-- &quot;Voices&quot; and &quot;You &amp; Me&quot;, especially-- but Disclosure refuse to stick to any single genre. They effortlessly spin through romantic house (&quot;Defeated No More&quot;, &quot;F For You&quot;), pitch-screwed bass music (&quot;Second Chance&quot;), and raunchy grime-inflected motifs (&quot;Confess to Me&quot;); nothing is off limits, and Settle is all the better for it.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Intro\n02 When a Fire Starts to Burn\n03 Latch (feat.
