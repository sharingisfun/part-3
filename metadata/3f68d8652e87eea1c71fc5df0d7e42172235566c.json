It peaked at number 2 on the US charts and number 6 on the UK charts. It is The Who's last album with Keith Moon as the drummer; Moon died approximately three weeks after the release of this album.\n\n2011 Remaster\n\nOn 24 December 2011 Universal Japan reissued the original analogue mixes of the album on CD for the first time in over a decade. Although the album used the original mixes, the bonus tracks from the 1996 album were included using vintage mixes where possible for these tracks.\n\nThe album was reissued in a miniature replica of the vinyl album for CD. As of January 2012, there were no plans to reissue these original mixes on CD anywhere other than on this limited, numbered edition of the album in Japan.\n\n2011 Remaster Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01.     &quot;New Song&quot;   \t4:12\n02. \t&quot;Had Enough&quot; (John Entwistle) \t4:30\n03. \t&quot;905&quot; (Entwistle) \t4:02\n04. \t&quot;Sister Disco&quot;   \t4:21\n05. \t&quot;Music Must Change&quot;   \t4:37\n06. \t&quot;Trick of the Light&quot; (Entwistle) \t4:06\n07. \t&quot;Guitar and Pen&quot;   \t5:58\n08. \t&quot;Love Is Coming Down&quot;   \t4:06\n09. \t&quot;Who Are You&quot;   \t6:21\n10. \t&quot;No Road Romance&quot;   \t5:05\n11. \t&quot;Empty Glass&quot;   \t6:23\n12. \t&quot;Guitar and Pen (Olympic '78 Mix)&quot;   \t6:02\n13. \t&quot;Love Is Coming Down&quot; (Work-in-Progress Mix)&quot;   \t4:05\n14. \t&quot;Who Are You&quot; (Lost Verse Mix)&quot;   \t6:22\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f68d8652e87eea1c71fc5df0d7e42172235566c","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Who+Are+You+%5B2011+Remaster%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f68d8652e87eea1c71fc5df0d7e42172235566c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,104,216,101,46,135,238,161,199,31,197,223,13,126,66,23,34,53,86,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
