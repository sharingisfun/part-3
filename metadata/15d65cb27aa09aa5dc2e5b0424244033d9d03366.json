Featuring a special sneak peak at the new McGarvey novel, End Game!\r\nThe seventeen-year-old daughter of the widowed President of the United States is kidnapped from Georgetown University outside Washington, DC.\r\nA ransom note mysteriously appears on the presidentâ€™s desk in his private study off the Oval Office. The demand is as simple as it is impossible: The US must immediately begin a ground war in Syria. If the President doesnâ€™t comply within 24 hours, his only daughter will be publicly executed.\r\nThe terrorists believe that pitting the U.S. against Russian troops in a ground war will allow ISIS to decisively create its Caliphate, from which it would be free to wage war against the entire world. The Middle East would sink into a new and barbarous century.\r\nFormer CIA assassin Kirk McGarvey gets the call in the middle of the night for an emergency meeting with the President of the United States. His mission: find the Presidentâ€™s daughter and return her safely to the White House.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d65cb27aa09aa5dc2e5b0424244033d9d03366","amp;dn":"24+Hours+-+David+Hagberg+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d65cb27aa09aa5dc2e5b0424244033d9d03366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,214,92,178,122,160,154,165,220,46,91,4,36,36,64,51,217,208,51,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
