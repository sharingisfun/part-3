Of course, in this crazy battle of PS2 vs. Xbox, Xbox vs GameCube, GameCube vs. PS2, nothing is ever normal. With that comes Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Developed and published by Electronic Arts, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is, like the rest, based on J.K. Rowlings book series. Playing as Harry Potter and his friends, players can explore Hogwarts, learn ?2nd year? spells, uncover hidden items, and battle in the Chamber of Secrets. The game will be released in the fall.\n\nDo you missing a game?
