They say he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. They say he's part man, part myth, and mostly street-corner rumor. And they are wrong on every count. Only averagely tall, slender, and god-awful with a sword, Locke Lamora is the fabled Thorn, and the greatest weapons at his disposal are his wit and cunning. He steals from the rich - they're the only ones worth stealing from - but the poor can go steal for themselves.\n\nBook one for the Gentleman Bastards sequence. Hope ya'll enjoy it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa91dcf5691b6df2b07070a141abc546eb9a1fd","amp;dn":"+The+Lies+of+Locke+Lamora+-+Scott+Lynch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa91dcf5691b6df2b07070a141abc546eb9a1fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,169,29,207,86,145,182,223,43,7,7,10,20,26,188,84,110,185,161,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
