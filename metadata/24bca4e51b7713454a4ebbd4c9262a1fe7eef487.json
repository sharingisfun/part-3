There's his voice, for one thing, a soulful and versatile blue-collar growl that sounds like Bob Seger working his way through the Stax/Volt catalog, and he's also turned into a pretty good meat-and-potatoes songwriter, too, although yes, it's his guitar playing that keeps the pot boiling.\n\nThis oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a real cooker so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d suggest turning the player  up to 11 before putting the CD in. If you put this one in the CD player while letting the car warm up, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be needing an ice scraper Ã¢â‚¬â€ or a heater for that matter. The Devil You Know contains some of the tastiest guitar work youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to find this winter. And once you read the list of players that lend their talents to this great piece of work, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know why.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 - The Devil You Know [00:04:21] \n02 - Second Mind [00: 3:22] \n03 - I'm Tired (Feat.
