Physical Forms released a split 7-inch single, \nHoofdriver, with Deerhoof on Polyvinyl Records. Another of Busdriver's projects is Flash Bang Grenada, a \ncollaboration with the rapper Nocando. The duo released the debut album, 10 Haters, on Hellfyre Club in 2011.\n\nBusdriver's solo album, Beaus$Eros, was released on Fake Four Inc. in 2012.
