You'll hear the sound and vigor of everything from Accept to Priest, Maiden to Scorpions, but without sounding like a copy of any of those significant bands.\n\nAt the core of their tunes are strong riffs which are melodic, harmonious, and catchy. This is supported by a strong rhythm section with steady groove. The vocals can be somewhat suspect. \n\nPastor sings clean, with a strong presence, but he's not all that clear or articulate. This is likely due to not singing in his native language. He's backed up many times by gang vocals, a staple of traditional heavy metal.\n\nType:\n    Full-length\nRelease date:\n    February 21st, 2015\nCatalog ID:\n    N/A\n\nLabel:\n    Killer Metal Records\nFormat:\n   \n1. \tNew Horizons \t01:34 \t \n2. \tShow them our Fire \t03:25 \t \n3. \tNight of the Warriors \t03:45 \t \n4. \tThunderheart \t03:21 \t \n5. \tConcrete Jungle \t03:56 \t \n6. \tKilling Yours Fears \t03:27 \t \n7. \tRules of a Lie \t04:34 \t \n8. \tBulletproof \t03:39 \t \n9. \tI'll Always Be There For You \t03:43 \t \n10. \tRise or Fall \t04:04 \t \n  \t35:28 \t \n\n\n Lineup\n\nRicardo LÃƒÂ¡zaro \tDrums (2014-present)\nSee also: Calibre Zero, Nigromante (live), ex-Opus Dead, ex-Steel Horse\t\n\nWilly GascÃƒÂ³n \tGuitars, Bass (2014-present)\nSee also: ex-Steel Horse, ex-Nigromante (live), ex-Dead End Road\n\nJavier Pastor \tVocals (2014-present)\nSee also: Wild, ex-Majesty Night\n\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
