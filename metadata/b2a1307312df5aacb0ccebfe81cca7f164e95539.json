Although the quartet put out stereo versions of their albums concurrent with the mono ones throughout most of their career, the Beatles considered the mono versions as definitive.\n\nThe limited-edition 14-LP Beatles in Mono vinyl box set includes the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first nine U.K. albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Please Please Me to The Beatles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the American-compiled Magical Mystery Tour and a collection of Mono Masters, which consist of non- album singles and tracks, all on 180-gram vinyl.\n\nGrammy-winning engineer Sean Magee and Grammy-winning mastering supervisor Steve Berkowitz remastered each record for vinyl in the same room at Abbey Road Studios where most of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums were recorded, using quarter-inch master tapes without the help of any digital technology. Instead, they opted for the mastering procedures used in the Sixties, even consulting notes used by the original engineers who cut the vinyl. Magee and Berkowitz spent weeks listening to the recordings, comparing the masters with first pressings of the vinyl albums from the 1960s\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2a1307312df5aacb0ccebfe81cca7f164e95539","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+TBIM+Sgt+Pepper+%282014+Vinyl+Remaster+2009%29+24Bit+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2a1307312df5aacb0ccebfe81cca7f164e95539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,161,48,115,18,223,90,172,176,204,235,254,129,204,167,241,100,233,85,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
