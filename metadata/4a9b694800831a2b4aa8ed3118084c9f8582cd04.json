Like Jay-Z, T.I. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ born Clifford Harris in Atlanta, GA ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ carried a balance of smoothness and toughness, and although 2001\\'s I\\'m Serious didn\\'t shoot him out of the gate ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Reasonable Doubt, he consistently grew and launched a string of major hits with 2003\\'s \\&quot;24\\'s.\\&quot; Throughout the six following years, T.I. maintained a consistent presence on urban radio stations in America: 2003\\'s Trap Muzik, 2004\\'s Urban Legend, 2006\\'s King (released in tandem with T.I.\\'s debut screen appearance in ATL), 2007\\'s T.I. vs T.I.P., and 2008\\'s Paper Trail ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ all released through the MC\\'s deal with Atlantic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were Top Ten albums, with the latter three even spending time at the very top of the chart.\n\n+--------+\n| Artist | : T.I.\n+--------+\n\n\n+-------+\n| Genre | : Hip-Hop/Rap\n+-------+\n\n\n+---------------+\n| studio Albums |\n+---------------+\n\nI\\'m Serious (2001)\nTrap Muzik (2003)\nUrban Legend (2004)\nKing (2006)\nT.I. vs. T.I.P.
