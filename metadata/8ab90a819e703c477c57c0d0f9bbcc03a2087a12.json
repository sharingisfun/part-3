Python is a natural choice for new and experienced developers, and this hands-on resource is a much needed guide to enterprise-level testing development methodologies. The book will show you why Unit Testing and TDD can lead to cleaner, more flexible programs.\n\nUnit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) are increasingly must-have skills for software developers, no matter what language they work in. In enterprise settings, it's critical for developers to ensure they always have working code, and that's what makes testing methodologies so attractive. This book will teach you the most widely used testing strategies and will introduce to you to still others, covering performance testing, continuous testing, and more.\n\n    Learn Unit Testing and TDDÃ¢â‚¬â€important development methodologies that lie at the heart of Agile development\n    Enhance your ability to work with Python to develop powerful, flexible applications with clean code\n    Draw on the expertise of author David Sale, a leading UK developer and tech commentator\n    Get ahead of the crowd by mastering the underappreciated world of Python testing\n\nKnowledge of software testing in Python could set you apart from Python developers using outmoded methodologies. Python is a natural fit for TDD and Testing Python is a must-read text for anyone who wants to develop expertise in Python programming.\n\n-------------------------------\nKeep learning and Help us to share the Knowledge across the World.\n-------------------------------\n\nMore Ebooks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab90a819e703c477c57c0d0f9bbcc03a2087a12","amp;dn":"Testing+Python+-+Wiley+%282014%29+PDF+-+GOLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab90a819e703c477c57c0d0f9bbcc03a2087a12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,185,10,129,158,112,60,71,124,87,192,208,249,187,204,3,162,8,122,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
