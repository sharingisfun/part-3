The album features strong elements of the mixture of funk and R&amp;B genres, but it is notable for being one of the group's definitive acid jazz albums.\nThe recurring theme on the album deals with lyrics about world issues and self-consciousness, along with several jazz instrumentals that made the album a success in the band's native country. The album produced several well-received singles, including &quot;Too Young To Die&quot; and &quot;Blow Your Mind&quot;. The album was listed in the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die list. Entertainment Weekly described the album as helping the band &quot;turn out gritty organic grooves with enthusiasm.&quot; Q magazine gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as &quot;A funky and beautiful record, a contender for best British soul album of the '90s, and frankly better than anything Stevie Wonder has made since Hotter Than July.&quot; BBC Music claims - &quot;...the album was an infectious, funk mezze of trumpets, saxophones, didgeridoos and flutes, spawning the hit singles Too Young To Die and Blow Your Mind which both entered the UK Top 10 in 1993.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd673d5b6df077a720f7d4d4a5dd7358535095b","amp;dn":"Jamiroquai+-+Emergency+on+Planet+Earth%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd673d5b6df077a720f7d4d4a5dd7358535095b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,214,115,213,182,223,7,122,114,15,125,77,74,93,215,53,133,53,9,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
