It was first released in the United Kingdom by Track Records on 23 May 1969. On 31 May, the album was released in the United States by Decca Records. Tommy was mostly composed by the band's guitarist Pete Townshend as a double album that tells the story about a &quot;deaf, dumb and blind kid&quot;. The album was the first musical work to be billed overtly as a rock opera.\n\nOn November 11, 2013, a &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; version of Tommy was released, with a new digital remaster of the original album mix, a cd of demo recordings and out-takes,  and 21 previously unreleased live tracks from 1969 and 1976 on a bonus disc.\n\nSuper Deluxe Edition Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\n\nDisc 1 - The Original Album (2013 Remaster)\n\n01.
