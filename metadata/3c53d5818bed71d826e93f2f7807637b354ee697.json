This track was either specifically written for the film or is ridiculously obscure because I could find no trace of it, or the artist, anywhere.\n\n** Not every song appears in the film in it's original form. &quot;Don't Stop Believin&quot; by Journey is found as an instrumental piece played by the string quartet at the wedding of the main character, Robbie. Also, &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot; by Wham isn't played at all. 2 lines of the song are sung by Robbie's girlfriend, Linda.\n----------------------------------\n\nDumb &amp; Dumber - Complete Soundtrack\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5630477/Dumb_And_Dumber_-_Complete_Soundtrack_%5B320kbps%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5630477/Dumb_And_Dumber_-_Complete_Soundtrack_%5B320kbps%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c53d5818bed71d826e93f2f7807637b354ee697","amp;dn":"The+Wedding+Singer+-+Complete+Soundtrack+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c53d5818bed71d826e93f2f7807637b354ee697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,83,213,129,139,237,113,216,38,233,63,47,120,7,99,123,53,78,230,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
