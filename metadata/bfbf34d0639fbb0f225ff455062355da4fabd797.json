The\nband was founded when an\nadvertisement posted by\ndrummer Lars Ulrich in a local\nnewspaper, was responded to by\nJames Hetfield. Metallica's line\nup has primarily consisted of\nUlrich, rhythm guitarist and\nvocalist James Hetfield and lead\nguitarist Kirk Hammett, while\ngoing through a number of\nbassists (Ron McGovney, Cliff\nBurton, Jason Newsted). The spot\nis currently held by Robert\nTrujillo. The band's original lead\nguitarist, before Hammett, was\ncurrent Megadeth guitarist and\nlead vocalist Dave Mustaine.\nMetallica's early releases\nincluded fast tempos,\ninstrumentals, and aggressive\nmusicianship that placed them as\none of the &quot;big four&quot; of the\nthrash metal subgenre alongside\nSlayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax\nduring the genre's development\ninto a popular style. The band\nearned a growing fan base in the\nunderground music community\nand critical acclaim, with the\n1986 release Master of Puppets\ndescribed as one of the most\ninfluential and &quot;heavy&quot; thrash\nmetal albums. The band\nachieved substantial commercial\nsuccess with their eponymous\nfifth album (also known as The\nBlack Album), which debuted at\nnumber one on the Billboard\n200. With this release the band\nexpanded its musical direction\nresulting in an album that\nappealed to a more mainstream\naudience.\nBand : Metallica\nTitle : Beyond Magnetic\nGenre : Thrash/Speed Metal\nReleased : 2011\nTracklist:\n01.
