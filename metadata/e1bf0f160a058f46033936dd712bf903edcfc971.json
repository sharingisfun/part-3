You can also dictate into a Nuance-approved digital voice recorder from anywhere, at any time, for Dragon to transcribe later.\n\n\n==================\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n==================\n\nView the ReadMe included for a simple, step-by-step install. This is the cleaned/automated \\\\\\&quot;Adrian Dennis\\\\\\&quot; release. (That one had a nasty trojan included, plus poorly written instructions for installing it.) I\\\\\\'ve included a batch file to automated the confusing part, as well as the full manual instructions if you\\\\\\'d rather.\n\nThis has been installed and tested on Windows 7 Home/Pro/Ultimate 64-bit. It\\\\\\'s amazing what it can do if you spend just a few minutes training it! I created the torrent, opened my browser, copy/pasted and typed all this text, as well the the process for uploading the torrent... all using it! :-)\n\n--\nPeace. ~G","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1bf0f160a058f46033936dd712bf903edcfc971","amp;dn":"Nuance+Dragon+NaturallySpeaking+11.5+Premium+%28English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1bf0f160a058f46033936dd712bf903edcfc971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,191,15,22,10,5,143,70,3,57,54,221,113,43,249,3,237,207,201,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
