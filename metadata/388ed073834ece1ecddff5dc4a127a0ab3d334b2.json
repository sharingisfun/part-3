The book's subject matter ranges from the heady heights of literature and love to the gritty realism of violence and death as it explores how humans make sense of senseless events. Its throng of unforgettable characters includes academics and convicts, writers and cops, pursuing their own separate yet interrelated quests for meaning: an enigmatic Prussian novelist who disappears from the public eye after the death of his lover; a group of literary critics who bond through their shared love of the novelist's works; an African American journalist sent to Mexico on a sports beat in the wake of his mother's death; and a Spanish professor and widowed father whose mind is beginning to lose its grip on reality. Their lives intersect in the urban sprawl of Santa Teresa, a fictional JuÃ¡rez on the US-Mexico border, where the serial killings of hundreds of young working class women remain unsolved.\r\n\r\nA New York Times Bestseller\r\nWinner of the 2008 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction\r\nA 2008 New York Times Book Review Top 10 Book of the Year\r\nA 2008 Time Magazine Top 10 Book for Fiction\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\r\n||\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       ||\r\n|     {FPL} - FerraBit Public Library (Aug 2016):\t\t  \t       ||\r\n| \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\n| Author:\t\tTitle:\t\t\t\tRead by:\t\t|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388ed073834ece1ecddff5dc4a127a0ab3d334b2","amp;dn":"2666+-+Roberto+Bola%26ntilde%3Bo+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388ed073834ece1ecddff5dc4a127a0ab3d334b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,142,208,115,131,78,206,30,205,223,245,220,74,18,122,10,179,211,52,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
