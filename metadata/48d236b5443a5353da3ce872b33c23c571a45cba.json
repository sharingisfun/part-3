Marcus Lopez hates school. His grades suck. The jocks are hassling his friends. He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t focus in class. But the jocks are the children of Joseph StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top assassin, the teachers are members of an ancient league of assassins, the class heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s failing is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dismemberment 101,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and his crush has a doubledigit body count. Welcome to the most brutal high school on earth, where the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top crime families send the next generation of assassins to be trained. Murder is an art. Killing is a craft. At Kings Dominion School for the Deadly Arts, the dagger in your back isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always metaphorical.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48d236b5443a5353da3ce872b33c23c571a45cba","amp;dn":"Deadly_Class_v01_-_Reagan_Youth_%282014%29_%28Digital%29_%28DR_%26amp%3B_Quinc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48d236b5443a5353da3ce872b33c23c571a45cba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,210,54,181,68,58,83,83,218,60,232,114,179,60,35,197,113,164,92,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
