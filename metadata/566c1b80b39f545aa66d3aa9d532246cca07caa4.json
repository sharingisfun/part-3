This one consists mostly of album songs that were never released as singles. Some of them were. That's something that makes this CD even more fun to listen too than the classic hit filled first volume. Everyone knows those songs, but a lot of these songs aren't well known to the casual observer. You get cover versions of &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; and an unbelieveable pitch perfect cover of Ricky Nelson's great hit &quot;Hello Mary lou&quot;. Fogerty was definitley channeling Ricky on that one!. It's a mystery as to why a CCR classic such as &quot;Born On The Bayou&quot; is on this volume instead of the first one. Other gems here are &quot;Don't Look Now(It Ain't You Or Me)&quot;, the up tempo funk of &quot;Born To Move&quot;, and the rocker &quot;Pagan Baby&quot;. The band was known for doing fairly short to the point rock songs with no glitz or glamor. They are pretty much the quintessential rock band. There are many songs on here that you knew and heard of, but didn't realize that it was them who did it. Songs like &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; and &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;. This collection also gives you the fun novelty rocker &quot;It Came Out Of The Sky&quot;. It also has the undoubtedly perfect ballad, &quot;(Wish I Could) Hideaway&quot;. If you have Volume one, then you need this one. It's an essential piece of music that would be in any rock and roll fan's collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:566c1b80b39f545aa66d3aa9d532246cca07caa4","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clerwater+Revival+-+Chronicle+vol+Two+%5BFlac%5D%5BTNT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"566c1b80b39f545aa66d3aa9d532246cca07caa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,108,27,128,179,159,84,90,166,109,58,169,213,50,36,108,202,7,202,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
