He released his debut album Hello Afrika in late 1990, with both the title track and &quot;No Coke&quot; becoming million-selling European hits in 1991. In 1992, second album One Love earned him a sizable hit in the title track and unleashed another two million-selling-plus Euro-smashes in &quot;It's My Life&quot; and &quot;Sing Hallelujah,&quot; cementing his place as one of Euro-dance's brightest stars.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.It's My Life (Reggae Mix)\n02.Let The Beat Go On\n03.No Coke\n04.Long Time Ago\n05.Mr. D.J.\n06.I Like To Move It (Feat.
