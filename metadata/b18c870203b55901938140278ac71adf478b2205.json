Lockhart, author of We Were Liars, calls &quot;a thrill a minute.&quot;\n\nPanic began as so many things do in Carp, a poor town of twelve thousand people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do. Heather never thought she would compete in panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors. She'd never thought of herself as fearless, the kind of person who would fight to stand out. But when she finds something, and someone, to fight for, she will discover that she is braver than she ever thought.\n\nDodge has never been afraid of panic. His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game; he's sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he's not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for. For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of themÃ¢â‚¬â€and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b18c870203b55901938140278ac71adf478b2205","amp;dn":"Panic+-+Lauren+Oliver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b18c870203b55901938140278ac71adf478b2205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,140,135,2,3,181,89,1,147,129,64,39,138,199,26,223,71,139,34,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
