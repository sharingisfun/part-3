Author Pieter Schlosser shows how to use Cubase 7 to create your music, starting with the very first steps: setting up audio and VST connections, utilizing templates, and customizing your Cubase workspace. Then learn how to import audio, set your tempo, and create a click track and markers. The next chapter shows you how to record and edit audio tracks, including how to overdub and loop, as well as apply and edit fades and crossfades. Then, Pieter moves into MIDI recording and editing, covering how to choose sounds, edit performances in the Piano Roll view, and use MIDI controller lanes to enhance the performance. He wraps up the course with a chapter on adding effects, creating aux sends, automating your mix, and exporting the final track.\n\nTopics include:\n\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tChoosing a template from the Project Assistant\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tImporting a drum loop as a starting point\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tRecording guitar\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tChoosing an amp and inserting other effects\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdding virtual instruments\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdding a compressor\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with presets\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tExporting the final mix\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729950b1629acca2947724cf2b7dd4689824ce7e","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+Cubase+7+with+Pieter+Schlosser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729950b1629acca2947724cf2b7dd4689824ce7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,153,80,177,98,154,204,162,148,119,36,207,43,125,212,104,152,36,206,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
