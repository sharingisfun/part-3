Judged merely by his records alone, the man's legacy is enormous. As the leader of the Impressions, he recorded some of the finest soul vocal group music of the 1960s. As a solo artist in the 1970s, he helped pioneer funk and helped introduce hard-hitting urban commentary into soul music. &quot;Gypsy Woman,&quot; &quot;It's All Right,&quot; &quot;People Get Ready,&quot; &quot;Freddie's Dead,&quot; and &quot;Superfly&quot; are merely the most famous of his many hit records.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Gypsy Woman\n02.It's All Right\n03.I'm So Proud\n04.Keep On Pushing\n05.Amen\n06.People Get Ready\n07.Woman's Got Soul\n08.We're A Winner\n09.Choice Of Colors\n10.Freddie's Dead\n11.Superfly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
