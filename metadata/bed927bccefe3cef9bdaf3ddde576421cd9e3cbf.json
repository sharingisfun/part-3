With a 14-year career under their belts, P.O.D.\nhas logged a remarkable array of achievements, including worldwide sales\nexceeding 7 million. Supported by their passionate fanbase - known as &quot;The\nWarriors&quot; - the band has created what they describe as &quot;a catalog of music that\nwe want to respect and honor with each step into the future.&quot;\n\nRhino salutes the group&amp;#039;s multiplatinum tenure with Atlantic Records with a\nsingle-disc compilation that mixes album tracks with unreleased and hard-to-find\nsongs.
