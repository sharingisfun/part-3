Much that is new or little knownÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a marvel of fact.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Newsweek\n\n\n\nAdolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography [EPUB]\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning historian John TolandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic, definitive biography of Adolf Hitler remains the most thorough, readable, accessible, and, as much as possible, objective account of the life of a man whose evil effect on the world in the twentieth century will always be felt.\n\nTolandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research provided one of the final opportunities for a historian to conduct personal interviews with over two hundred individuals intimately associated with Hitler. At a certain distance yet still with access to many of the people who enabled and who opposed the fÃƒÂ¼hrer and his Third Reich, Toland strove to treat this life as if Hitler lived and died a hundred years before instead of within his own memory. From childhood and obscurity to his desperate end, Adolf Hitler emerges as, in TolandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words, Ã¢â‚¬Å“far more complex and contradictory . . . obsessed by his dream of cleansing Europe Jews . . . a hybrid of Prometheus and Lucifer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf395437f3c66e343144f0e97fc053e8b9d4019","amp;dn":"Adolf+Hitler+UNABRIDGED+%5Baudiobook%5D+%2B+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf395437f3c66e343144f0e97fc053e8b9d4019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,243,149,67,127,60,102,227,67,20,79,14,151,252,5,62,139,157,64,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
