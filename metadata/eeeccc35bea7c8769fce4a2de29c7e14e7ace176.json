Second only to Bob Dylan (and perhaps Paul Simon), he commands the attention of critics and younger musicians more firmly than any other musical figure from the '60s who is still working in the 21st century, which is all the more remarkable an achievement for someone who didn't even aspire to a musical career until he was in his thirties.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeeccc35bea7c8769fce4a2de29c7e14e7ace176","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+Popular+Problems+%282014%29+%5BHD+Tracks%5D+24.96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeeccc35bea7c8769fce4a2de29c7e14e7ace176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,236,204,53,190,167,200,118,159,206,74,45,226,156,126,20,231,172,225,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
