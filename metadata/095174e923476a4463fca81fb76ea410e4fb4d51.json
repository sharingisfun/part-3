ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lifestyle and a movement. The stories of weight loss, increased energy, healthy-looking skin, and better digestion are seemingly endless. However, many people are turned off by the difficulty and unpleasantness of eating only (or even primarily) foods cooked below 104 degrees Fahrenheit. With dozens of recipes accompanied with beautiful, full-color photographs, Erica Palmcrantz and Irmela Lilja prove that eating raw foods can be simple, inexpensive, and delicious. No one should have to sacrifice time, money, or flavor to enjoy the astounding health advantages of going raw. Learn how to soak and sprout vegetables and nuts to increase the nutritional value, what types of kitchen tools are best for preparing raw food, and which foods to have on-hand for use in raw recipes. From creative salads to spicy burritos to chocolate mousse, every recipe will broaden your raw-food horizons. Complete with recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, desserts, and side dishes, Raw Food is an innovative approach to a wholesome way of eating. 122 Color\n\nAbout the Authors\nErica Palmcrantz Aziz is a raw-food educator and has been a high-raw vegan for almost four years.
