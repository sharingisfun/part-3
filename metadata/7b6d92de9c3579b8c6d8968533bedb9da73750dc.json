We learn about possible side effects from the VR gaming headset, they reminisce on old shitty video games, read though a news story about a pizza rape rat, and Joe and Ant finish up the day taking about finishing as teenagers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b6d92de9c3579b8c6d8968533bedb9da73750dc","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-09-29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b6d92de9c3579b8c6d8968533bedb9da73750dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,109,146,222,156,53,121,184,198,216,150,133,51,190,219,157,167,55,80,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
