Also included is the branch line to the new airport of Berlin-Brandenburg (which is not yet open in the real world!). Adding to that is a stretch of 18 km of the Berlin S-Bahn, including original AI trains and rolling stock as well as parts of the Leipzig tram network, again with original AI trains and rolling stock.\r\n\r\nToday this route is one of the most important train lines in Germany allowing speeds up to 200 km/h.
