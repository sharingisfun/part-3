While Section One is concerned with the background of wellness as a healthcare paradigm in the United States and major theories of wellness, and historical context for wellness, Section Two contains specific information on the social, physical, emotional, and cognitive domains of wellness. The last main section of the book synthesizes the first two sections of the book to extract practical applications of wellness in behavioral healthcare intervention counseling","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6cdc2c6bb9a94ddac06548f075ac3940931642","amp;dn":"Wellness+Counselling%2C+Granello+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D%7BHTD15%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6cdc2c6bb9a94ddac06548f075ac3940931642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,108,220,44,107,185,169,77,218,192,101,72,240,117,172,57,64,147,22,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
