There are some\nexcellent pictures and illustrations, worth checking out for sure!\n\nBest wishes to David Icke, a true champion of exposing suppressed knowledge! :)\n\nEnjoy!\n\ndjarmani / 2X\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n   Description\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nDavid Icke, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most controversial author, has spent the last quarter of a century\nunravelling the secrets of the Universe, reality and the forces that manipulate our world.\n\nWhat was once ridiculed and dismissed is now being confirmed again and again as Icke,\na figure of fun for so long, is acknowledged as a man way ahead of his time.\n\nIn this massive work of 435,000 words, 900 pages and more than 800 illustrations,\nIcke lays out in dot-connected detail a lifetime of research and insight about our\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœcomputerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-simulated reality, the holographic universe and the hidden non-human forces\nthat are manipulating human life via hybrid bloodline families and networks into a\nglobal Orwellian state of total control.\n\nWhat Icke exposes across a vast range of connected subjects, people and events provides\nthe tools and awareness for humanity to stop this unfolding nightmare and restore the world\nto what it once was and will be again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a place of love, harmony, peace and awakened\nconsciousness.\n\nAs Icke says: Ã¢â‚¬ËœI can now see that my whole life has been leading to this book.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nThe Perception Deception is destined to be a work recorded by history as the masterpiece\nthat changed the world.\n\nwww.davidicke.com\n\n\n\n-=- 2X -=","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e0a6b404315b516fcfd9af76e1bb6ed1ffea38","amp;dn":"David+Icke+-+The+Perception+Deception+-+MP3+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e0a6b404315b516fcfd9af76e1bb6ed1ffea38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,224,166,180,4,49,91,81,111,207,217,175,118,225,187,110,209,255,234,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
