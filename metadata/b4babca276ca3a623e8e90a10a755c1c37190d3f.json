In the midst of WWII, innocent French girl Noelle Page (Marie-France Pisier) falls in love with dashing American pilot Larry Douglas (John Beck). When Larry is given new orders taking him back to America, he tells Noelle that he'll come back for her -- when he doesn't, she becomes bitter and pledges to use men for their money and power, not for love. Noelle goes on to become a famous actress and weds Constantin Demeris (Raf Vallone), a Greek multi-millionaire. But she can't shake her passion for Larry, and eventually she hires him to work as her personal pilot. While at first he does not recognize her, soon Larry and Noelle are once again involved in a torrid affair, and when Larry's wife Catherine (Susan Sarandon) refuses to give him a divorce, he and Noelle begin planning a scheme to arrange an &quot;accidental&quot; death for Catherine. The Other Side of Midnight marked the American debut of actress Marie-France Pisier, following her role in the international success Cousin, Cousine. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076507/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076507/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-76507/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-76507/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\n\nCharles Jarrott\n\n\n\n        Marie-France Pisier\tNoelle Page\n\tJohn Beck\t... \tLarry Douglas\n\n\tSusan Sarandon\t... \tCatherine Alexander Douglas\n\tRaf Vallone\t... \tConstantin Demeris\n\n\tClu Gulager\t... \tBill Fraser\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:46:08\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 660 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,09 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4babca276ca3a623e8e90a10a755c1c37190d3f","amp;dn":"The+Other+Side+Of+Midnight+-1977-+Raf+Vallone%2C++Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4babca276ca3a623e8e90a10a755c1c37190d3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,186,188,162,118,202,58,98,62,142,144,161,10,117,92,28,55,25,13,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
