Rilke's work invokes haunting images that focus on the difficulty of communion with the ineffable in an age of disbelief, solitude, and profound anxiety.  These deeply existential themes tend to position him as a transitional figure between the traditional and the modernist writers.\n\nAmong English-language readers, his best-known works include the poetry collections DUINO ELEGIES (1922) and SONNETS TO ORPHEUS (1922), the semi-autobiographical novel THE NOTEBOOKS OF MALTE LAURIDS BRIGGE (1910), and a collection of ten letters that was published after his death under the title LETTERS TO A YOUNG POET (1929).\n\n\nThe following books are a mix of PDF or ePUB/MOBI formats as indicated:\n\n* DUINO ELEGIES &amp; THE SONNETS TO ORPHEUS (Houghton Mifflin, 1977).
