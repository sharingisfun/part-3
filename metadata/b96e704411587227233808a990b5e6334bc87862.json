Dont worry, its nothing major, its 3 seconds.\nMost important of all is that it will resume shortly from the scene that it\ngot stucked, meaning, no scenes are missing. Its complete.\nThis is a SOURCE issue, not ours, we cant do nothing to fix it,\nunless someone's else makes a new capture from the same place.\n(which is unlikely)\nAll encodes you will be seeing today until the retail/itunes\nversions pops-out, will have the same issue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b96e704411587227233808a990b5e6334bc87862","amp;dn":"Tomorrowland.2015.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b96e704411587227233808a990b5e6334bc87862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,110,112,68,17,88,114,39,35,56,8,169,144,181,230,51,75,200,120,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
