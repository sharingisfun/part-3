With 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s In Rainbows, Radiohead continue to seek new patterns and blends without succumbing to pure art for artÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sake. Kid A and Amnesiac took them to the ambient edge and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been clawing themselves slowly back to the pop playground ever since. Thom Yorke is a naturally gifted vocalist whose acapella can lift any melody to stratospheric heights and when his group turns down the volume and settles into a subdued groove (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nude, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Weird Fishes/ ArpeggieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), the result is a surreal new age vibe where what could be sterile, slick tones are infused with touches of extreme emotionalism. There is always a sense of danger lurking in the guitars and keyboards; storm clouds frequently gather by mid-song. The angry clank of Ã¢â‚¬Å“15 Step,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the marching synthesizer doom behind Ã¢â‚¬Å“All I Need,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the obscuring, mysterious reverb of Ã¢â‚¬Å“House of CardsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ create soundscapes that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to dream beyond the usual instrumental limits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4a247d8c7e84a9a823d0f5e820f5543345d7ded","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+In+Rainbows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4a247d8c7e84a9a823d0f5e820f5543345d7ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,162,71,216,199,232,74,154,130,61,15,94,130,15,85,67,52,93,125,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
