It was directed by Richard Lester and originally released by United Artists. The film was made in the style of a Mockumentary, describing a couple of days in the lives of the group.\n\nIt was successful both financially and critically; it was rated by Time magazine as one of the all-time great 100 films. British critic Leslie Halliwell described it as a &quot;comic fantasia with music; an enormous commercial success with the director trying every cinematic gag in the book&quot; and awarded it a full four stars. The film is credited with having influenced 1960s spy films, The Monkees' television show and pop music videos.\n\nBefore A Hard DayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Night was released in America, a United Artists executive asked Lester to dub the voices of the group with mid-Atlantic accents. McCartney angrily replied, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLook, if we can understand a fuckin' cowboy talking Texan, they can understand us talking Liverpool.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Lester subsequently directed The Beatles' 1965 film, Help! and later several popular films, including The Three Musketeers and Superman II.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\A Hard Day's Night (1964)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\A Hard Day's Night (1964)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 1.12 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 27mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 819 Kbps\nMovie name                       : A_HARD_DAYS_NIGHT.Title1.DVDRip\nWriting application              : Lavf52.78.4\nOriginal source form/Name        : A_HARD_DAYS_NIGHT\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 2\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 27mn\nBit rate                         : 1 483 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 430 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.674\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.200\nStream size                      : 932 MiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 27mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 20.6 MiB (2%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 234 ms (5.62 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 24 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.4\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 6083\n3/16/2011 10:26:36 PM\nmbam-log-2011-03-16 (22-26-36).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 24 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
