You begin the course by understanding network fundamentals, discussing topics such as the OSI Model, switch and router functionality, and cabling standards. From there, you will move quickly into understanding the differences between IOS and IOS-XR (CiscoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s service provider-specific OS), configuration of routing protocols in both IPv4 and IPv6, network services, and device management.\n\nUnlike most other Cisco courses, there are no pre-requisites for the SPNGN1 certification course. However, know that this course does move faster than most since Cisco assumes most individuals aspiring to work in a service provider role have some previous background in a technology arena. In addition, Jeremy has created a Ã¢â‚¬Å“reduced scheduleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of videos for those already competing the CCENT (ICND1) or CCNA (ICND2) courses. Be sure to view the first video for the complete list!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42f9d7fa96cb78d1286980b3715e031222ca7006","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+-+CCNA+Service+Provider+SPNGN1+640-875","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42f9d7fa96cb78d1286980b3715e031222ca7006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,249,215,250,150,203,120,209,40,105,128,179,113,94,3,18,34,202,112,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
