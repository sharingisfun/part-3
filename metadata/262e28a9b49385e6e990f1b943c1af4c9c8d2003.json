He is thirty-eight, divorced, and childless and has just been fired for sabotaging a government official's speech.

After a run-in with his father, Langston takes off for his feisty aunt's house in Baltimore, where he embarks on a remarkable quest for his family's past.\r\n\r\nIt's said that those who forget history are condemned to repeat it, but to Langston, history offers not condemnation but reprieve.
