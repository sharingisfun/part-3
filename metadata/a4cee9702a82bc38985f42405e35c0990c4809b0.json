It is a spin-off based on the Saint Seiya manga series written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada, produced in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the franchise. The series began broadcasting in Japan on TV Asahi on April 1, 2012. It is being directed by Morio Hatano (his debut as series director), with animation character designs by illustrator and animator Yoshihiko Umakoshi, known for performing the same duties on Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation, HeartCatch PreCure! and Casshern Sins.\n\nToei Animation describes it as an &quot;original anime story&quot;, separate from the continuity of Kurumada's manga. Original Saint Seiya author Kurumada is not involved in the creative process of Omega, thus he is credited as the original creator of the series' concept.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4cee9702a82bc38985f42405e35c0990c4809b0","amp;dn":"Saint+Seiya+Omega","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4cee9702a82bc38985f42405e35c0990c4809b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,206,233,112,42,130,188,56,152,95,66,64,94,53,192,153,12,72,9,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
