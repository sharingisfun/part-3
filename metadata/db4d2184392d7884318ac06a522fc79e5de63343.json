His formative years were as colorful as the scenarios played out in his music: his father was a professional gambler, a lifestyle which forced the family to move frequently, and Zevon spent most of his formative years in California and Arizona. He learned to play piano, focusing primarily on classical material before a disintegrating home life led him into pop music, as well as a few run-ins with the law; after his parents divorced when he was 16 years old, Zevon hopped into the Corvette his father won in a card game and headed for New York to become a folk singer. His music found little response, however, and he returned to California, eventually releasing his first recordings as part of the duo Lyme &amp; Cybelle. Session work followed before Zevon issued his solo debut Wanted Dead or Alive in 1969; the LP received a poor reception, and so he returned to session work and composed advertising jingles, and also served as the Everly Brothers' pianist before the duo's breakup. Following a 1974 sabbatical to Spain, Zevon returned to Los Angeles, where his longtime friend Jackson Browne had secured him a recording deal; with Browne in the producer's seat, Zevon cut a self-titled offering which was met with lavish critical praise upon its 1976 release. His 1978 follow-up Excitable Boy established him as a wholly unique talent, and earned a sizable hit with its wry single &quot;Werewolves of London.&quot;\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Werewolves Of London\n02.Excitable Boy\n03.Play It All Night Long\n04.Roland The Headless Thompson Gunner\n05.The Envoy\n06.Mohammed's Radio\n07.Desperados Under The Eaves\n08.Johnny Strikes Up The Band\n09.I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\n10.Lawyers, Guns And Money\n11.Ain't That Pretty At All\n12.Poor Poor Pitiful Me\n13.Accidentally Like A Martyr\n14.Looking For The Next Best Thing\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db4d2184392d7884318ac06a522fc79e5de63343","amp;dn":"Warren+Zevon+-+The+Best+Of+%281990%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db4d2184392d7884318ac06a522fc79e5de63343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,77,33,132,57,45,120,132,49,138,192,106,82,47,199,158,93,230,51,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
