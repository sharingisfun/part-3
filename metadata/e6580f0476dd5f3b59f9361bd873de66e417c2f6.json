While it may not venture off into the abstractions explored in the latter part of his career, it does deserve recognition for its impeccable cohesiveness. An excellent album, introspective and beautiful. \n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6580f0476dd5f3b59f9361bd873de66e417c2f6","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+Quartet+-+Ballads+1963","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6580f0476dd5f3b59f9361bd873de66e417c2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,88,15,4,118,221,95,59,89,249,54,27,216,115,222,102,228,23,194,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
