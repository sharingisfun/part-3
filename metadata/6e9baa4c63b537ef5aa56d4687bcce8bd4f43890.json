His expressed dissatisfaction with the response of the President Diaz puts him in danger, and when he rashly rescues a prisoner from the local militia he becomes an outlaw. Urged on by a strolling intellectual, Fernando, he supports the exiled Don Francisco Madero against Diaz, and becomes the leader of his forces in the South as Pancho Villa is in the North. Diaz flees, and Madero takes his place; but he is a puppet president, in the hands of the leader of the army, Huerta, who has him assassinated when he tries to express solidarity for the men who fought for him. Zapata and Villa return to arms, and, successful in victory, seek to find a leader for the country. Unwillingly, Zapata takes the job, but, a while later, he responds to some petitioners from his own village with no more reassurance than had Diaz years before., Realizing that with power his idealism has gone, he returns with them to Morelos - specifically to investigate their complaints against his brother Eufemio. New leaders take his place, and, egged on by the always surviving Fernando, they decide that Zapata is a threat to their regime.\n\n\nDirector: Elia Kazan\nWriter: John Steinbeck\nRelease Date: 1952\nGenre: History | Western\n\n\nCast:\nMarlon Brando\t... \tEmiliano Zapata\nJean Peters\t... \tJosefa Zapata\nAnthony Quinn\t... \tEufemio Zapata\nJoseph Wiseman\t... \tFernando Aguirre\nArnold Moss\t... \tDon Nacio\nAlan Reed\t         ... \tPancho Villa\nMargo     \t... \tSoldadera\nHarold Gordon\t... \tFrancisco Indalecio Madero\nLou Gilbert\t... \tPablo\nFrank Silvera\t... \tVictoriano Huerta\nFlorenz Ames\t... \tSeÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±or Espejo\nRichard Garrick\t... \tOld General\nFay Roope\t         ... \tPresident Porfirio Diaz\nMildred Dunnock\t... \tSeÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ora Espejo\n\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English and Portuguese-BR\nVideo: DVD Rip\nVideo Codec: XVID\nVideo Bitrate: 964 Kbps\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 192\nResolution: 496x368\nScreen: Full Screen\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e9baa4c63b537ef5aa56d4687bcce8bd4f43890","amp;dn":"Viva+Zapata%21+%5B1952%5D+%28subs%3A+EN%2FPT-BR%29+-+Elia+Kazan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e9baa4c63b537ef5aa56d4687bcce8bd4f43890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,155,170,76,99,181,55,239,90,165,109,70,135,188,206,139,212,244,56,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
