No serial is needed\n  to install or to play (the single player campaign) and you\n  can make the installer shutdown the computer automatically\n  at the end of the installation.\n\n- The game is updated with the last patch 1.1 (main menu shows\n  v1.1.1.711) and does not need to be cracked.\n\n- Multiplayer does not work unless you have a valid key.\n\n- Voice and text are in English and Spanish (the rest of the\n  languages have been deleted). The installer will give you\n  the chance to install one or both (and, in this second case,\n  let you choose later using a cmd menu).\n\n- Every level can be unlocked if the user wants to.\n\n- A trainer, several guides and the libraries the game requires\n  are also included.\n\n\nAttention!: this release ONLY RUNS UNDER 64-BIT Windows systems\nand (to be able to burn the .iso into a single DVD-5) two\nthings have been deleted: the intro video and the low resolution\ntextures, so it is mainly MADE TO RUN UNDER A POTENT PC.\n\n\n\n============================================================\nInstructions:                                              =\n============================================================\n\n1. Mount, burn or just unzip the .iso file.\n2. Run &quot;Setup.exe&quot; to install the game.\n3. Use the shortcuts the installer creates to play.\n\n\n\n============================================================\nFAQ:                                                       =\n============================================================\n\nQ: My game does not work.\nA: Try installing or updating DirectX and Visual C++ libraries.\n\nQ: Single player asks for a serial.\nA: This is due to SECUROM. Just do not run the game from\n   &quot;Crysis.exe&quot; but from &quot;Crysis64.exe&quot;, or use the shortcuts\n   the installer makes.\n\nQ: Does the multiplayer work in this release?\nA: Yes, but only if you have a valid game key. In this case,\n   run the game from &quot;Crysis.exe&quot; instead of &quot;Crysis64.exe&quot;.\n\nQ: Does it use DirectX 9 or DirectX 10?\nA: Under XP, DX9; under Vista/7/8, you can choose between DX9\n   and DX10.\n\nQ: Do I need Steam to play?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Does this release work under a 32-bit Windows?\nA: No.\n\n\n\nNotice this is not an update but the full game. Do not install\nit over an existing installation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62855fc0e245f509a1572c88abbcf78c28165e38","amp;dn":"Crysis+Warhead+v1.1.1.711+64-bit+%28repack%29+%28English%2FSpanish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62855fc0e245f509a1572c88abbcf78c28165e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,133,95,192,226,69,245,9,161,87,44,136,171,188,247,140,40,22,94,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
