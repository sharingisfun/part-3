Throughout these lessons we will cover the foundations of modeling a high resolution female that will deform properly when animated. Along the way we will learn how we can avoid many common beginner mistakes and develop a workflow that is efficient and effective. We will also learn a lot of basic and advanced female anatomy, and how to capture high resolution realism with simple geometry. By the end of this course you will have a great foundation for building your own female characters for film, broadcast and video games.\n\n1. Introduction and project overview 01:56\n\n2.
