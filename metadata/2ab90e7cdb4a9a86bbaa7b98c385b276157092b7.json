But they are just the program's prototypes, and now that their testing is complete, they're slated to be permanently &quot;decommissioned,&quot; causing them to seize their one chance to make a desperate run for freedom. Relentlessly pursued by their makers, the WE3 team must navigate a frightening and confusing world where their instincts and heightened abilities make them as much a threat as those hunting them - but a world, nonetheless, in which somewhere there is something called &quot;home.&quot;&quot;\n\nThese are the new digital rips by Zone-Empire.
