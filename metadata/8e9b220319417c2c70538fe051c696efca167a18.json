A dependable hitmaker throughout the late '80s and early '90s, Marx scored with rockers (&quot;Don't Mean Nothing,&quot; &quot;Should've Known Better&quot;), and ballads (&quot;Right Here Waiting,&quot; &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot;) alike. Greatest Hits collects those songs as well as the lion's share of his high -end chart action- of which there was plenty, proving that a devotion to craft sometimes pays off better than fickle inspiration.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000002TLX.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000002TLX.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
