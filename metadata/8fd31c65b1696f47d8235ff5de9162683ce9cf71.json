No, it is more than just a record: it is an exultation of Adolf Hitler, who from the moment his plane descends from Valhalla-like clouds is visually characterized as a God on Earth. The &quot;Jewish question&quot; is disposed of with a few fleeting closeups; filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl prefers to concentrate on cheering crowds, precision marching, military bands, and Hitler's climactic speech, all orchestrated, choreographed and illuminated on a scale that makes Griffith and DeMille look like poverty-row directors. It has been alleged that the climactic rally, &quot;spontaneous&quot; Sieg-Heils and all, was pre-planned according to Riefenstahl's specifications, the better to take full advantage of its cinematic potential. Allegedly, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels resented the presence and intrusion of a woman director, but finally had to admit that her images, achieved through the use of 30 cameras and 120 assistants, were worth a thousand speeches. Possibly the most powerful propaganda film ever made, Triumph of the Will is also, in retrospect, one of the most horrifying. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025913/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025913/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSubs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-25913/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-25913/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nLeni Riefenstahl\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:49:25\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480 4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1637 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd31c65b1696f47d8235ff5de9162683ce9cf71","amp;dn":"Triumph+des+Willens+%281935%29+Leni+Riefenstahl+-Ger+%28English+Subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd31c65b1696f47d8235ff5de9162683ce9cf71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,211,28,101,177,105,111,71,216,35,95,245,222,145,98,104,60,233,207,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
