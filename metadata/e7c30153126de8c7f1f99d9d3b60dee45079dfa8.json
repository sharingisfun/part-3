With Skin, he sets himself apart from the former and exceeds the latter, uncovering more sides and bringing more focus to his fusion of dance, pop, hip-hop, and R&amp;B. A cadre of well-chosen, equally genre-hopping collaborators helps him do this with surprisingly artful results: Kai's graceful vocals on &quot;Never Be Like You&quot; equal Streten's beats without distracting from them, while Tove Lo brings some of her sexy edge to &quot;Say It&quot; (and both songs underscore that dance/pop hybrids don't have to sink to both genres' lowest common denominators). Skin's hip-hop leanings also feel more organic than they did previously, whether on the meeting of veteran and new talent that is the Allan Kingdom and Raekwon collab &quot;You Know,&quot; or Vince Staples' cameo on &quot;Smoke &amp; Retribution,&quot; which also features up-and-coming Aussie producer/singer KuÄka, who also features on the more abstract &quot;Numb &amp; Getting Colder.&quot; The album's brightest highlights bring out the best in Streten and his guests: MNDR takes a convincing turn as a pop diva on &quot;Like Water; and even though he's Auto-Tuned, Beck has rarely sounded as uninhibited as he does on &quot;Tiny Cities.&quot; Meanwhile, Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano elevates &quot;Take a Chance&quot; into one of Flume's finest moments yet, her soulful tones a perfect match for its powerful builds and drops. Though instrumentals like the darkly percussive &quot;Wall Fuck&quot; and the fizzy, pixelated &quot;Pika&quot; showcase Streten's range as a producer, the vocal tracks are so compelling that his solo turns sometimes feel like afterthoughts that bloat the album. While it could have benefitted from some editing, Skin still shows a lot of growth -- it's more mature, and more memorable, than Flume","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c30153126de8c7f1f99d9d3b60dee45079dfa8","amp;dn":"Flume+-+Skin+%282016%29+%5B24.44+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c30153126de8c7f1f99d9d3b60dee45079dfa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,195,1,83,18,109,232,199,241,249,157,157,59,96,222,228,80,121,223,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
