The Future is Unwritten is more than just a biography of Strummer; it is a tribute and exploration of a musician, artist and devoted humanist. Though Temple respects and admires Strummer (his influence is exalted by close friends, peers and fans like Bono and John Cusack), he doesn\\'t romanticize this larger-than-life personality and presents Strummer honestly and not always in flattering light, though the director\\'s fondness for his subject is constant. Most movingly, Strummer himself provides the narration via reassembled excerpts from a variety of interviews and the BBC radio show he hosted during the nineties. In the wrong hands, this could be contrived, but in this masterful documentary it serves as a testament to not just Joe Strummer the myth, but Joe Strummer the man, telling us his story in vivid detail. The Future is Unwritten is a moving and personal portrait of a musician who helped shaped not just punk, but modern music as a whole. \n\nAdditional Information: \n\nExtra Info: Director: Julien Temple Stars: Joe Strummer, Steve Jones and Mick Jones \n\nExtra Info: Feel free to upload this film everywhere you can or want.
