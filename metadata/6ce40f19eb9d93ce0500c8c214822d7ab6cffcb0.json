The album is notable for containing songs not usually included on Who compilation albums, such as the band's Rolling Stones cover &quot;The Last Time&quot;, with other less well-known singles as &quot;Dogs&quot; and &quot;Relay&quot;, as well as more familiar tunes, album-only tracks and B-sides.\n\nIncluded is every song from the compilation Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy except &quot;A Legal Matter&quot; (whose melody happens to be quite similar to that of &quot;The Last Time&quot;). The album is also notable for including one brand new song, &quot;Be Lucky&quot;, recorded during 2014 sessions for a proposed new 2015 studio album. The song is the first new material released by the Who since their 2006 studio album, Endless Wire.\n\nDeluxe Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1 \t\n\n01. \t&quot;Zoot Suit&quot; \t1:59\n02. \t&quot;I Can't Explain&quot;   \t1965 single \t2:05\n03. \t&quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot; 1965 single \t2:43\n04. \t&quot;My Generation&quot;   \tMy Generation \t3:18\n05. \t&quot;Substitute&quot;   \t1966 single \t3:45\n06. \t&quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;   \tExtended version \t3:06\n07. \t&quot;I'm a Boy&quot;   \t1966 single \t2:38\n08. \t&quot;Happy Jack&quot;   \t1966 single (UK)\t2:14\n09. \t&quot;Boris the Spider&quot; (John Entwistle) \tA Quick One \t2:30\n10. \t&quot;Pictures of Lily&quot;   \t1967 single \t2:44\n11. \t&quot;The Last Time&quot; (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards) \t1967 single \t2:59\n12. \t&quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; (Single version) \tThe Who Sell Out \t4:08\n13. \t&quot;Call Me Lightning&quot;   \t1968 single (US) \t2:19\n14. \t&quot;Dogs&quot;   \t1968 single \t3:01\n15. \t&quot;Magic Bus&quot; (Mono extended version) \t4:36\n16. \t&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;   \tTommy \t3:00\n17. \t&quot;I'm Free&quot;   \tTommy \t2:41\n18. \t&quot;The Seeker&quot;   \t1970 single\t3:10\n19. \t&quot;Summertime Blues&quot; \tLive at Leeds \t3:22\n20. \t&quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot; (Single version) \tTommy \t3:30\n21. \t&quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; (Single version) \tWho's Next \t3:38\n22. \t&quot;Let's See Action&quot;   \t1971 single \t3:57\n23. \t&quot;Bargain&quot;   \tWho's Next \t5:33\n24. \t&quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;   \tWho's Next \t3:42\n\nDisc 2 \t\n\n25. \t&quot;Baba O'Riley&quot;   \tWho's Next \t5:08\n26. \t&quot;Join Together&quot;   \t1972 single \t4:22\n27. \t&quot;Relay&quot;   \t1972 single \t3:52\n28. \t&quot;5:15&quot; (Single version) \tQuadrophenia \t4:48\n29. \t&quot;Love, Reign o'er Me&quot;   \tQuadrophenia \t5:56\n30. \t&quot;Postcard&quot; (Entwistle) \tOdds &amp; Sods \t3:27\n31. \t&quot;Squeeze Box&quot;   \tThe Who by Numbers \t2:40\n32. \t&quot;Slip Kid&quot;   \tThe Who by Numbers \t4:36\n33. \t&quot;Who Are You&quot; (Single version) \tWho Are You \t5:14\n34. \t&quot;Trick of the Light&quot; (Entwistle) \tWho Are You \t4:27\n35. \t&quot;You Better You Bet&quot;   \tFace Dances \t5:37\n36. \t&quot;Don't Let Go the Coat&quot;   \tFace Dances \t3:44\n37. \t&quot;Athena&quot;   \tIt's Hard \t3:46\n38. \t&quot;Eminence Front&quot;   \tIt's Hard \t5:39\n39. \t&quot;It's Hard&quot;   \tIt's Hard \t3:47\n40. \t&quot;Real Good Looking Boy&quot; ( Radio edit) \tThen and Now \t3:55\n41. \t&quot;It's Not Enough&quot; (Townshend, Rachel Fuller) \tEndless Wire \t4:03\n42. \t&quot;Be Lucky&quot;   \tNew song made for this album \t3:19","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce40f19eb9d93ce0500c8c214822d7ab6cffcb0","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+The+Who+Hits+50+%5BDeluxe%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce40f19eb9d93ce0500c8c214822d7ab6cffcb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,228,15,25,235,157,147,206,5,0,200,194,20,130,45,122,182,207,252,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
