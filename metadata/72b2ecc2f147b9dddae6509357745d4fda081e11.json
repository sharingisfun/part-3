Edwyn Collins formed \nthe Nu-Sonics (named after a cheap brand of guitar) with his school-mate \nAlan Duncan and was subsequently joined by James Kirk and Steven Daly, \nwho left a band called The Machetes. The band became Orange Juice in \n1979. They are best known for the hit &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, which reached number 8 \non the UK Singles Chart in February 1983, the band's only UK Top 40 hit.\n\nThe band released their first singles during 1981 on the independent Postcard \nRecords label founded by Alan Horne, along with fellow Scottish bands Josef \nK and Aztec Camera. Shortly afterwards this line-up signed to Polydor \nRecords and recorded their first album, You Can't Hide Your Love Forever. \nHowever, internal tensions led to Kirk and Daly leaving in early 1982 (they \nwould go on to form a short-lived band called Memphis), and for the next two \nalbum releases the core line-up was: Collins and McClymont with Malcolm Ross \non guitar, vocals and keyboards, and Zeke Manyika on drums. By early 1984, \nRoss and McClymont had left the band leaving a core line-up of Collins and \nManyika who recorded Orange Juice's final album, The Orange Juice, with \nClare Kenny and Johnny Britten, produced by Dennis Bovell.\n\nThe band's only Top 40 hit, &quot;Rip It Up&quot; was achieved with the aid of the \nsynthesizer.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n    You Can't Hide Your Love Forever (UK No.21) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ March 1982\n    Rip It Up (UK No.39) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 1982\n    Texas Fever (UK No.34) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ March 1984\n    The Orange Juice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 1984\n\nSingles\n    1980 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Falling and Laughing&quot; (UK Indie Chart No.48)\n    1980 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Blue Boy&quot; (UK Indie Chart No.15)\n    1980 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Simply Thrilled Honey&quot; (UK Indie Chart No.5)\n    1981 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Poor Old Soul&quot; (UK Indie Chart No.5)\n    1981 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Wan Light&quot; (scheduled on Postcard Records but never released)\n    1981 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;L.O.V.E.
