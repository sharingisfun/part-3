With the adaptive learning program, SmartBookâ„¢, every student has a unique experience personalized to their needs.\r\nThe new edition uses â€œHeatMapâ€ technology to advise the revision. Systematic and precise feedback from thousands of students was anonymously collected using LearnSmartâ„¢. Because virtually every paragraph in the previous edition is tied to several questions students answer in LearnSmart, the author was able to see where students struggled mostâ€¦the â€œhot spotsâ€â€¦and in turn refine and update these areas to be more clear, more concise, and more impactful. \r\nThe 11th edition continues with Feldman's accessible pedagogy and hallmark research, as well as his modules-within-chapters format that is both manageable for students and allows every professor the flexibility to assign and cover what they want. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface xxiii\r\nCHAPTER 1 Introduction to Psychology 2\r\nCHAPTER 2 Neuroscience and Behavior 48\r\nCHAPTER 3 Sensation and Perception 86\r\nCHAPTER 4 States of Consciousness 130\r\nCHAPTER 5 Learning 168\r\nCHAPTER 6 Memory 202\r\nCHAPTER 7 Thinking, Language, and Intelligence 236\r\nCHAPTER 8 Motivation and Emotion 284\r\nCHAPTER 9 Development 324\r\nCHAPTER 10 Personality 380\r\nCHAPTER 11 Health Psychology: Stress, Coping, and Well-Being 416\r\nCHAPTER 12 Psychological Disorders 446\r\nCHAPTER 13 Treatment of Psychological Disorders 486\r\nCHAPTER 14 Social Psychology 520\r\nGlossary G-1\r\nReferences R-1\r\nCredits C-1\r\nName Index I-1\r\nSubject Index I-21\r\n \nhttp://s29.postimg.org/gtxfbxd5z/Essentials_of_Understanding_Psychology_11th_Ed.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e3a799d49f95db85f6c061d600db5409fde8fe","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Understanding+Psychology+%2811th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e3a799d49f95db85f6c061d600db5409fde8fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,227,167,153,212,159,149,219,133,246,192,97,214,0,219,84,9,253,232,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
