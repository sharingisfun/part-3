Until the welcomed arrival of authors Josh Rosenbaum and Josh Pearl, no one had taken the time to properly codify the lifeblood of the corporate financier s work namely, valuation, through all of the essential lenses of an investment banker. With the release of Investment Banking, Second Edition: Valuation, Leveraged Buyouts, and Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Rosenbaum and Pearl once again have written the definitive book that they wish had existed when they were trying to break into Wall Street. The Second Edition includes both the technical valuation fundamentals as well as practical judgment skills and perspective to help guide the science. This book focuses on the primary valuation methodologies currently used on Wall Street: comparable companies analysis, precedent transactions analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, and leveraged buyout analysis. With the new fully revised edition, they have added the most comprehensive, rigorous set of intuition-building and problem-solving ancillaries anywhere all of which promised to become essential, knowledge enhancing tools for professionals, and professors and students.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAdditional Resources xiii\nAbout the Authors xv\n\nForeword xvii\n\nAcknowledgments xix\n\nINTRODUCTION 1\n\nStructure of the Book 3\n\nPart One: Valuation (Chapters 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3) 3\n\nPart Two: Leveraged Buyouts (Chapters 4 &amp; 5) 5\n\nPart Three: Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (Chapters 6 &amp; 7) 6\n\nValueCo Summary Financial Information 8\n\nPART ONE: Valuation 11\n\nCHAPTER 1: Comparable Companies Analysis 13\n\nSummary of Comparable Companies Analysis Steps 14\n\nStep I.
