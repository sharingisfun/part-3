They found 80 acres of land, including their own rainforest, and want to build a sustainable home. Will they overcome the challenges of building that way on their own?\n\nPlease Note- Although this has &quot;Hector&quot; in the tag, it was actually capped by my friend Azza. I am currently in hospital. He did not label it under his name because he used all of my equipment and settings and decided it would be better as my name to keep it all uniform. So, a big thanks to Azza!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e2d16bc1015afe35f56cc1d56249e555f91cbd","amp;dn":"Grand.Designs.AU.s05e04.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e2d16bc1015afe35f56cc1d56249e555f91cbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,226,209,107,193,1,90,254,53,245,108,193,213,98,73,229,85,249,28,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
