David's interest in violin began at the age of four, when his older brother received a violin from his father -- who himself was a antique stringed-instrument dealer. \nA year later, David had already won a competition, and by seven he was playing in public as often as possible. Within five more years, David had gone on to perform with an orchestra (playing Mozart) and at the age of ten made his concert debut. As his teenage years dawned, David had already released two albums and appeared on television. This kind of talent was quickly picked up by Deutsche Grammophone, which offered and signed a contract with the violinist when he was only 14 years old. He graduated from Juilliard in New York in 2004, after having been a student with Itzhak Perlman. David Garrett has performed with many of the world's orchestras, and in 2007 he played with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, touring the United States with the orchestra in 2008. In 2009 he released a self-titled album on the Decca label. The varied repertoire included music from Bizet, a version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDueling BanjosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ plus a cover version of Michael JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmooth CriminalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. A year later he returned with Rock Symphonies, an album featuring material from Nirvana, Guns ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roses, and Metallica. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSymphonic Rock/Classical\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nAfter a self-titled release that flirted with pop crossover, violinist David Garrett dives deep into that world with his 2010 effort, an album that rocks like its 1766. Most arrangements are simple as Garrett takes the melodies from NirvanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and Led ZeppelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKashmirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and plays them furiously in front of an equally aggressive orchestra thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s augmented by electric guitars and a standard rock kit drummer. No great revelations to be had, but the tracks work well enough, recasting some of rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classics as Romantic-era works that are prime for television commercials designed to sell diamonds or wine to the post-Woodstock set. Rock Symphonies exceeds its predecessor when it comes to the more clever cuts, such as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVivaldi vs. Vertigo,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a mash-up of VivaldiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Four Seasons and U2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVertigo.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fun how ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe 5thÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ messes with BeethovenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s -- heck, classical musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s -- most famous piece and how his take on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk This WayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ references the Aerosmith and Run-D.M.C. version before turning into a fiddle-led hoedown. Keep in mind, the showy Garrett is a polarizing figure in the classical community, so donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect your snootier friends to agree, but if your kids spend way too much time behind the violin, this just might turn them on to rock &amp; roll. \n\n\n01.Smells Like Teen Spirit\n02.November Rain\n03.The 5th\n04.Walk This Way\n05.Toccata\n06.Vivaldi Vs.
