Two\n  multimode  filters with  distortion are  then applied  to shape  its sonic\n  character. Finally, carefully chosen modulation options are provided by two\n  syncable comprehensive LFOs, four loopable velocity sensitive ADSR envelope\n  generators and vibrato.\n           \n           \n    What's new in Ultra Analog VA-2  \n           \n\n\n           \n\n  Factory library\n           \n    The completely renewed factory  library has well over  600 production-ready\n  sounds classified for fast and intuitive exploration.\n           \n\n  Compressor and equalizer\n           \n    These new additions are perfect to add punch and definition to your  sound,\n  letting you cut through any dense mix or stage.\n           \n\n    Limiter  \n           \n    The   new  output   limiter  protects   your  ears   and  monitors   during\n  experimentation with the  synth's parameters while  providing a maximum  of\n  distortion-free dynamics.\n           \n           \n\n  Streamlined interface\n           \n    Redesigned from the ground up,  the new interface now divides  Ultra Analog\n  VA-2 into  three panels:  Play presents  shortcuts to  the performance  and\n  effect parameters including bypass switches for quick edits; Edit lets  you\n  tweak  and  create your  sound;  while FX  supplies  equalizer, compressor,\n  multi-effect, and reverb processors for a final sheen.\n         \n \n  Bank and program manager\n           \n   Ultra Analog VA-2's new  manager allows simple and  efficient organization,\n  backup, and sharing of your sounds.\n           \n\n  Overhauled effects\n           \n   Reinvigorated  and  polished, Ultra  Analog  VA-2's multi-effect  processor\n  features  our best  sounding chorus,  delay, phaser,  flanger, distortion,\n  notch filter, wah-wah, auto-wah, and reverb to date!
