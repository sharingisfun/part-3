The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Initially managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, the Beach Boys signed to Capitol Records in 1962. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid-1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed Pet Sounds album and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple surf rock of the Beach Boys' early years.\n\nStarting in 1967, Wilson gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, assuming a reduced level of input due to mental health and substance abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America despite once being seen as the primary competitors to the Beatles. Since the 1980s, there has been much publicized legal-wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits, and use of the band's name. Dennis Wilson drowned in 1983, and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, a number of versions of the band, each fronted by surviving members from the original quintet, continued to tour into the 2000s. For the band's 50th anniversary, they briefly reunited as the Beach Boys for a new studio album, world tour, and career-spanning retrospective box set.\n\nThe Beach Boys have often been called &quot;America's Band&quot;,[1] and Allmusic has stated that their &quot;unerring abilityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦made them America's first, best rock band.&quot;[2] The group have had over eighty songs chart worldwide, thirty-six of them United States Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band), four of those reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[2] The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and are listed at number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.[3][4] The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. \n\n\nSounds of Summer 2003 \n\n\nSounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys is a 2003 compilation of music by The Beach Boys released through Capitol Records. This collection is the most expansive compilation ever issued of their music, with 30 tracks clocking in at over 76 minutes and grabbing nearly every US Top 40 hit of their career, except for 1965's number 20 hit &quot;The Little Girl I Once Knew&quot;, and the 1976 top-30 hit &quot;It's O.K.&quot;. In 2011, Mike Love stated, &quot;Sounds of Summer is fast approaching selling three million copies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if it's triple-platinum, which is, you know, pretty good. And by the time this 50th celebration is over, it'll probably be more than triple-platinum.&quot;[2]\n\nSounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys was released in a market already containing the three volumes of hits issued during 1999 and 2000, but that did little to deter shoppers, who were responsible for shooting the CD into the US charts at number 16 (their highest peak since 1976's 15 Big Ones) and a lengthy 104-week stay. Currently certified triple platinum, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys was re-issued with a DVD component in 2004 with the regular edition remaining available.\n\nIn 2007, the album was succeeded by The Warmth of the Sun, which is composed of fan favorites and hits that were left off Sounds of Summer.\n\nThe album was re-released on February 7, 2012 as the Celebration Merch Set which featured the original CD along with a t-shirt celebrating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nTracks:\n \n\n1.\t&quot;California Girls&quot; (Brian Wilson/Mike Love [1965]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:44\n\tStereo remix from Endless Harmony Soundtrack\n2.\t&quot;I Get Around&quot; (Brian Wilson/Mike Love [1964]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:13\n3.\t&quot;Surfin' Safari&quot; (Brian Wilson/Mike Love [1962]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:05\n4.\t&quot;Surfin' U.S.A.&quot; (Brian Wilson/Chuck Berry [1963]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:27\n5.\t&quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; (Brian Wilson/Mike Love [1964]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:18\n6.\t&quot;Surfer Girl&quot; (Brian Wilson [1963]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:27\n7.\t&quot;Don't Worry Baby&quot; (Brian Wilson/Roger Christian [1964]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:47\n8.\t&quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; (Brian Wilson/Roger Christian [1963]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:38\n9.\t&quot;Shut Down&quot; (Brian Wilson/Roger Christian/Mike Love [1963]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:48\n\tExclusive new stereo remix\n10.\t&quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; (Brian Wilson/Mike Love [1965]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:46\n11.\t&quot;Be True to Your School&quot; (Brian Wilson/Mike Love [1963]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:08\n12.\t&quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot; (Brian Wilson/Mike Love [1964]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:02\n13.\t&quot;In My Room&quot; (Brian Wilson/Gary Usher [1963]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:12\n14.\t&quot;God Only Knows&quot; (Brian Wilson/Tony Asher [1966]) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:51\n15.\t&quot;Sloop John B&quot; (Trad.
