They range from hopeless crackheads, to guys who were just sick of doing it tough above ground.\n\nSome of this film is very gnarly, but some of it is actually really funny too.\nIt is extremely well filmed and put together by Marc Singer and well worth the download.\n\nEnjoy my first upload! Please seed if you rate it!\n\niseedforever\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ad5ba9f9e9c5db06b28d81ee136cd2483285fd","amp;dn":"Dark+Days+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ad5ba9f9e9c5db06b28d81ee136cd2483285fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,173,91,169,249,233,197,219,6,178,141,129,238,19,108,210,72,50,133,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
