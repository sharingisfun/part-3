No one, however, was prepared for the massive response to Lauryn HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album. Apart from the chart-topping singles Ã¢â‚¬Å“Doo Wop (That Thing)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everything Is EverythingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the album includes collaborations with DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Angelo, Carlos Santana and soul diva Mary J Blige. Her unique blend of Motown vocals and hip hop proved remarkably addictive, and the tracks are sweetly interspersed with classroom conversations on love. []Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ An album reminiscent of the classic soul records of Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill deserved every one of its Grammies. Ã¢â‚¬â€œEd Potton\n\nDescription: Grammy-winner Lauryn Hill releases her solo debut album, a follow-up to the FugeesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Score.
