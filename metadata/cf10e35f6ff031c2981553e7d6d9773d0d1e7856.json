Next, you'll run several simple demonstration programs where you'll learn the basics of a few common types of Node applications. Then you'll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.\n\nAbout this Book \njavascript on the server? You bet. Node.js is a javascript server capable of supporting scalable, high-performance web applications. Using asynchronous I/O, the server can do more than one thing at a time, a key requirement for real-time apps like chat, games, and live statistics. And since it's javascript, you use the same language end to end. \nNode.js in Action shows you how to build production-quality applications. Clear introductions of key concepts and example-by-example coverage take you from setup to deployment. You'll dive into asynchronous programming, data storage, and output templating, and interact with the filesystem to create non-HTTP applications like TCP/IP servers and command-line tools. Perfect for a web developer transitioning from Rails, Django, or PHP. Requires basic knowledge of javascript. No prior experience with Node.js needed. \nPurchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. \nWhat's Inside\nSet up Node and extensions\nGrok asynchronous programming and the event loop\nExamples including microblogging, IM, games, and more\nAbout the Authors \nAs skilled practitioners, expert teachers and trainers, and contributors to the core framework, authors Mike Cantelon, Marc Harter, T.J. Holowaychuk, and Nathan Rajlich represent the best of the Node.js development community. \n\nTable of Contents\nPART 1 NODE FUNDAMENTALS\n1.Welcome to Node.js\n2.Building a multiroom chat application\n3.Node programming fundamentals\nPART 2 WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT WITH NODE\n4.Building Node web applications\n5.Storing Node application data\n6.Connect\n7.Connect's built-in middleware\n8.Express\n9.Advanced Express\n10.Testing Node applications\n11.Web application templating \nPART 3 GOING FURTHER WITH NODE\n12.Deploying Node applications and maintaining uptime\n13.Beyond web servers\n14.The Node ecosystem\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dd4LbNj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dd4LbNj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf10e35f6ff031c2981553e7d6d9773d0d1e7856","amp;dn":"Node.js+in+Action+by+Mike+Cantelon%2C+Marc+Harter%2C+TJ+Holowaychuk+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf10e35f6ff031c2981553e7d6d9773d0d1e7856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,16,227,95,111,240,49,194,152,21,83,231,214,217,119,61,13,30,120,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
