She also examines why there was such great importance placed on oral traditions in ancient times, and what importance these traditions hold for present-day historians.\r\n\r\nFinally, recent examination of the Templecombe panel reveals why it is believed the Templars may have brought the Shroud to England for safekeeping in 1307. Richly illustrated and compiled using original research, this book is sure to appeal to everyone interested in the Knights Templar and their Somerset history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df3ea2cc0e6d08a42d44034f801f5242932eb91","amp;dn":"Glastonbury%2C+the+Templars+and+the+Sovran+Cloth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df3ea2cc0e6d08a42d44034f801f5242932eb91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,243,234,44,192,230,208,138,66,212,64,52,248,1,245,36,41,50,235,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
