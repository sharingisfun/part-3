Lang's music is notable for both his unusual voice, which at 13 was compared to that of a 40-year-old blues veteran, and for his guitar solos. His solo patterns have especially been noted for his frequent use of wide vibratos.[citation needed] He has five albums that charted on the top 50 of the Billboard 200 chart and has won a Grammy Award for Turn Around.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee169fccd3b83489db8e3b2eb622c4df14298e7","amp;dn":"Jonny+Lang+-+Fight+For+My+Soul+%5B2013%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee169fccd3b83489db8e3b2eb622c4df14298e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,225,105,252,205,59,131,72,157,184,227,178,235,98,44,77,241,66,152,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
