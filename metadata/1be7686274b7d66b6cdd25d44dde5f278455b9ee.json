Pentesting+hacking+SQLI Instructed by Mr. Hitesh Choudhary\r\n\r\nSQL Injection is a powerful code injection technique that is used to attack data driven web applications. An SQL Injection attack compromises a database and gives the attacker the access to the private data. Its implications can be far reaching as it can be used to access and modify data, bypass logins or even shutdown the website.\r\nWith this course you will see how to implement SQL Injection for pentesting purposes. You can create your own challenges and see how they can be penetrated.
