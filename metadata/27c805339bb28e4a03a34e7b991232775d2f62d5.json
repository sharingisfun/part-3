Nate Green does.\n\n Built for Show is the first fitness book to address young men on the prowl. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just written for them; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s written by one of them. Green, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just twenty- three years old, is already a veteran fitness professional whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been quoted in MenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Health and Maximum Fitness magazines. Green offers four twelve- week workout programs, each with a seasonal theme. The fall and winter workouts add muscle size and strength thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll show even under layers of clothing. The spring and summer workouts burn fat and chisel the showpiece musclesÃ¢â‚¬â€creating a lean, cut, beach-ready physique.\n\n But Built for Show is more than just a workout book. It also provides:\n\n Ã‚Â· Realistic nutrition advice to feed the muscles and starve the fat without breaking the bank or spending hours in the kitchen\n Ã‚Â· Tips on dressing right, looking the part, improving your social status, and settling into your new lifestyle\n Ã‚Â· Quick ways to assess posture, with useful exercises to fix flaws and improve self- presentation, no matter the situation.\n\n The detailed programs include over fifty exercises, illustrated with over one hundred original photos.\n\n Neither a weight-loss guide nor a body- building manual, Built for Show instead reveals to guys exactly what they need to build the body they Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and women Ã¢â‚¬â€œ want.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27c805339bb28e4a03a34e7b991232775d2f62d5","amp;dn":"Built+for+Show%3A+Four+Body-Changing+Workouts+for+Building+Muscle%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27c805339bb28e4a03a34e7b991232775d2f62d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,200,5,51,155,178,142,74,3,163,78,123,153,18,50,119,93,47,98,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
