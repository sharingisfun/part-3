Carl, &quot;Art Deco (Art of Century)&quot; \nEnglish | ISBN: 1844848469 | 2013 | PDF | 200 pages | 37 MB\n\nArt Deco style was established on the ashes of a disappeared world, the one from before the First World War, and on the foundation stone of a world yet to become, opened to the most undisclosed promises. Forgetting herself in the whirl of Jazz Age and the euphoria of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“AnnÃƒÂ©es FollesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the GarÃƒÂ§onne with her linear shape reflects the architectural style of Art Deco: to the rounded curves succeed the simple and plain androgynous straight lineÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nArchitecture, painting, furniture and sculpture, dissected by the author, proclaim the druthers for sharp lines and broken angles. Although ephemeral, this movement keeps on influencing contemporary design.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:815710ceb1cb53faf337c946e858ee746c730847","amp;dn":"Art+Deco+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"815710ceb1cb53faf337c946e858ee746c730847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,87,16,206,177,203,83,250,243,55,201,70,232,88,238,116,108,115,8,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
