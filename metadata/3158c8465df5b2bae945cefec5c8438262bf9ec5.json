He began his career as part of London's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk/New Wave movement of the mid-to-late 1970s.Steeped in word play, the vocabulary of Costello's lyrics is broader than that of most popular songs. His music has drawn on many diverse genres; one critic described him as a &quot;pop encyclopaedia&quot;, able to &quot;reinvent the past in his own image&quot;.\n\nCostello has won multiple awards in his career, including a Grammy Award, and has twice been nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male. In 2003, Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Costello number 80 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3158c8465df5b2bae945cefec5c8438262bf9ec5","amp;dn":"Elvis+Costello+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%5B1994%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3158c8465df5b2bae945cefec5c8438262bf9ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,88,200,70,93,245,178,186,233,69,206,254,197,200,67,130,98,191,158,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
