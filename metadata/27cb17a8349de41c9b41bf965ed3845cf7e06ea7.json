It is now easier to photograph the stars than ever before! They are compact and portable, flexible to adapt with different lenses and for telescope use, and above all DSLR cameras are easy and enjoyable to use. In this concise guide, experienced astrophotography expert Michael Covington outlines the simple, enduring basics that will enable you to get started, and help you get the most from your equipment. He covers a wide selection of equipment, simple and advanced projects, technical considerations and image processing techniques. Unlike other astrophotography books, this one focuses specifically on DSLR cameras, not astronomical CCDs, non-DSLR digital cameras, or film. This guide is ideal for astrophotographers who wish to develop their skills using DSLR cameras and as a friendly introduction to amateur astronomers or photographers curious about photographing the night sky.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 234 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (December 10, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521700817\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521700818","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27cb17a8349de41c9b41bf965ed3845cf7e06ea7","amp;dn":"Digital+SLR+Astrophotography%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27cb17a8349de41c9b41bf965ed3845cf7e06ea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,203,23,168,52,157,228,28,155,65,191,150,94,211,132,92,247,224,110,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
