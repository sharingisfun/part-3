His birth ended his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life in Tennessee. Scrawny and wiry, he runs away at the age of 14. As he makes his way westward, the impoverished and illiterate youth finds trouble at every turn. Then heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recruited by Army irregulars, lured by the promise of spoils and bound for Mexico. Churning a dusty path toward destiny, he witnesses unknown horrors and sufferingÃ¢â‚¬â€and yet, as if shielded by the almighty hand of God, he survives to breathe another day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e8a3940a029775e1e18d638f33dca61c3f86a5","amp;dn":"Cormac+McCarthy-Blood+Meridian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e8a3940a029775e1e18d638f33dca61c3f86a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,232,163,148,10,2,151,117,225,225,141,99,143,51,220,166,28,63,134,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
