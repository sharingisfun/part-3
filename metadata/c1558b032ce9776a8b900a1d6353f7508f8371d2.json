Indeed, contemporary interest in roots music can be directly traced to this stellar Grammy-nominated 1991 collaboration. Putting distinctive rustic spins on pop standards, blues classics, and folk staples, the kindred musical spiritsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ earnest authenticity and relaxed intimacy are matched only by virtuosic playing and superb production.\nUnadorned with any post-production tricks or overdubs, Garcia/Grisman breathes with naturalism and presence. You will effortlessly detect the full body of the instruments, witnessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nthe woody grain textures, and get lost in the surprisingly velvety qualities of GarciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lullaby-like singing.\n\nPals since the mid-1960s, Garcia and Grisman bonded over their love for traditional folk and bluegrass. The two teamed up amidst what became a gold rush of top-notch productivity and creativity for Garcia. Partnering with bassist Jim Kerwin and percussionist/fiddler Joe Craven, the pair approaches every passage with innate ease, as if either musician could finish the others sentence. The affable chemistry and soothing interplay wash over a selection of songs as notable for their diversity as the way Garcia and Ã¢â‚¬Å“DawgÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ turn them into the equivalent of old friends you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen in years.\n\nExquisite melodies and jewel-shaped notes decorate the simple, convivial structures of tunes that hop, jump, skip, skitter, and bop. The atmosphere is reminiscent of the legendary gypsy-jazz exchanges between Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli, and equally sharp. Swirling with Middle Eastern modality, the closing 16-minute-plus rendition of GrismanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rippling Ã¢â‚¬Å“ArabiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€complete with a section based on a Cuban fold themeÃ¢â‚¬â€is alone enough worth the price of admission to this sensational session. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so much more.\n\nThe quartet delves into Celtic themes (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Two SoldiersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), jazz-grass (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grateful DawgÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), old-world ballads (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Russian LullabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and Appalachian flavors (Ã¢â‚¬Å“WalkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ BossÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) with nonpareil skill and soulfulness. Garcia and GrismanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tandem picking throughout epitomize sublime. And for many listeners, the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revised version of the Grateful Dead staple Ã¢â‚¬Å“Friend of the DevilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ranks as the finest-ever recorded, the pace patient, the narrative vocals heartfelt, and the synchronous solos tailor-made for the enveloping progression. Better yet, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all captured in astonishing fidelity.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1558b032ce9776a8b900a1d6353f7508f8371d2","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+%26amp%3B+David+Grisman+-+Garcia+Grisman+%282014%29+MFSL+SA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1558b032ce9776a8b900a1d6353f7508f8371d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,85,139,3,44,233,119,106,139,144,10,29,99,83,247,80,143,131,113,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
