We see it all the time: We must establish a career before looking for a relationship. We must find love before feeling fulfilled. We must feel stressed out until we finish everything on our to-do list. But by far, the most common conditions we put on ourselves revolve around our weightÃ¢â‚¬â€no love until we lose the weight, no pursuing a dream until we lose the weight, no happiness until we lose the weight. But now thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a better option.\n\nUsing tapping, also known as EFT, Jessica Ortner walks you through a process that helps you drop stress so you can drop poundsÃ¢â‚¬â€without dieting, deprivation, or extreme exercise. Tapping, a tool that is based on the principles of both ancient acupressure and modern psychology, helps you address the underlying issues that make your body hold on to weight and gives you the ability to overcome some of the most common weight loss obstacles. Say good-bye to the cravings, panic, and self-doubt that keep you in a constant fight against your body!\n\nUsing her own struggles with weight loss, along with success stories of some of the thousands of women sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked with, Jessica teaches you not only the basics of tapping but also how to use it to address the deeper facets of your weight and self-worth challenges. This proven process is based on extensive research into the effects of tapping on stress hormones, and it provides simple, step-by-step instructions throughout and easy tapping meditations at the end of each chapter. With this loving and supportive guidance you can learn to create a more empowering relationship with food, find pleasure in exercise, and implement self-care into your life.\n\nSo join Jessica and learn to love yourself and your body!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c81be50d4f98a2fee56c7161e066c3e45e39a6d","amp;dn":"The+Tapping+Solution+for+Weight+Loss+%26amp%3B+Body+Confidence+%5BEpub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c81be50d4f98a2fee56c7161e066c3e45e39a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,129,190,80,212,249,138,47,238,86,199,22,30,6,108,62,69,227,154,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
