Gilmour was born in Cambridge, England on March 6, 1946; his parents were both involved in education -- his father was a lecturer in Zoology at Cambridge University and his mother was a teacher -- and as a schoolboy, Gilmour struck up a friendship with a boy who attended the same grade school, Roger Barrett, who later gained the nickname Syd. Gilmour became re-acquainted with Barrett while they were studying at the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology; both were interested in music and began learning to play guitar in their spare time, as did Barrett's friend Roger Waters. In 1963, Gilmour joined a rock group, Jokers Wild, which specialized in R&amp;B covers; in 1965, he and Barrett took the summer off and spent several months busking and traveling through France, though the adventure didn't pay off financially. After returning to England, Gilmour played with a group called Flowers for a while, as well as a revamped version of Jokers Wild called Bullitt; meanwhile, Barrett and Waters teamed up with Rick Wright and Nick Mason to form a group called the Tea Set, which was later renamed Pink Floyd. In 1967, Pink Floyd was the toast of London's burgeoning psychedelic scene on the strength of the singles &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play,&quot; and the album Piper at the Gates Of Dawn. However, Barrett had become increasingly unstable, sometimes becoming catatonic on-stage or playing different songs than his bandmates, and as his ability to perform was compromised, Gilmour was invited to join the group to help with guitar and vocals when Barrett was having trouble. However, after a few shows it became evident that Gilmour's presence wasn't enough to rescue Barrett, and the group's leader was let go as Gilmour became the band's new lead guitarist by default, and he would produce and play on Barrett's two solo albums before Barrett retired from music. \n\n\nGenre................: Progressive Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2006\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.A Pocketful Of Stones\n02.On An Island\n03.Where We Start\n04.Near The End\n05.Murder\n06.There's No Way Out Of Here\n07.Love On The Air\n08.The Blue\n09.Out Of The Blue\n10.Smile\n11.Cruise\n12.So Far Away\n13.You Know I'm Right\n14.No Way\n15.Short And Sweet\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:080337550633cfdc36a0c18b02720436f810678c","amp;dn":"David+Gilmour+-+Greatest+Hits+%282006%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"080337550633cfdc36a0c18b02720436f810678c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,3,55,85,6,51,207,220,54,160,193,139,2,114,4,54,248,16,103,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
