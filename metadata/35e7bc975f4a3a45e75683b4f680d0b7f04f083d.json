Many people don't have access to knowledge which might raise their level of life. \n\nThere are 2 OU courses I have uploaded so far:\n\n1. M255 - Object-Oriented Programming With Java - Units 1-14\n2. M257 - Putting JAVA to work - Units 1-12\n\nIf you have an access to other Java (and other IT) courses from the OU, like:\n\nSoftware engineering (TM354)\nMy digital life (TU100)\nAlgorithms, data structures and computability (M269)\nWeb technologies (TT284)\nCisco networking (CCNA) (T216)\nObject-oriented Java programming (M250)\nSoftware development with Java (M256)\nFundamentals of interaction design (M364)\nDeveloping concurrent distributed systems (M362)\nBuilding blocks of software (M263)\n\n\nPLEASE SHARE!!!\n\n\n=============================================\n\nThe M255 course aims to provide you with an understanding of the fundamental concepts involved in object-oriented programming (object, class, protocol, hierarchy, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and collaboration). \n\nThe blocks \n\nBlock 1 (Units 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4) provides an introduction to the course and to some fundamental \nideas of object-oriented programming. You will revise your knowledge of programming, \ngained from other courses or experience, and use it to understand and write simple \nobject-oriented code. You will be introduced to basic object-oriented concepts such as \nattribute, state, protocol, class and subclass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ initially through interaction with game-like \nmicroworlds. However, by the end of the block you will be able to extend existing \nclasses by writing the code for simple methods using the Java IDE BlueJ, and then test \nyour code using the OUWorkspace, a programming tool integrated into the BlueJ IDE \nand speciÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cally designed to enable you to write and test snippets of Java code in a \nquick and convenient way. \n\nBlock 2 (Units 5Ã¢â‚¬â€œ8) continues the teaching of fundamental object-oriented ideas, using \nthe BlueJ IDE and the OUWorkspace to investigate inheritance hierarchies, overriding, \nabstract classes, interfaces, polymorphism, reuse of code, static methods and \nvariables. Along the way you will learn about creating your own classes, and Ã¯Â¬ï¿½nd out \nmore about the facilities and library classes provided by Java. You will learn about \ndifferent kinds of errors and also about debugging using the IDE provided. You will \nbegin to understand more about the need to design code, and will learn to implement a \nclass according to a speciÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cation. \n\nBlock 3 (Units 9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11) introduces the concept of collections (objects that store other \nobjects) and related issues. You will be guided in applying the knowledge gained in the \nprevious two blocks, along with the new classes introduced in this block, to carry out \nincreasingly complex programming exercises. In particular, you will learn about the \nimportance of reuse and how to select an appropriate collection class from JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \nCollections Framework.\n\nBlock 4 (Unit 12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14) starts by discussing how to get information into a Java program\nfrom an external source (such as a Ã¯Â¬ï¿½le) and how to write information to an external \nsource, so enabling Java programs to communicate with the wider world. These ideas \nare further developed by discussing how an object can be saved to Ã¯Â¬ï¿½le from a running \nprogram, and at a later stage be read back into the program. The other new topic in this \nblock is testing code in an object-oriented context. You will put the ideas of testing into \npractice using a testing framework built into BlueJ called JUnit. Finally, the block \nconsolidates your learning by placing programming within the wider context of the \nsoftware development process.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35e7bc975f4a3a45e75683b4f680d0b7f04f083d","amp;dn":"m255+-+Object-Oriented+Programming+With+Java+-+The+Open+Universi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35e7bc975f4a3a45e75683b4f680d0b7f04f083d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,231,188,151,95,74,58,69,231,86,131,180,246,128,208,183,240,79,8,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
