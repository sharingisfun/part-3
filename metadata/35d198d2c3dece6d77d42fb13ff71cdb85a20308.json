It saw the debut of vocalist Bruce Dickinson, and the final appearance of drummer Clive Burr.\n\nThe Number of the Beast met with considerable critical and commercial success and was a landmark release for the band, becoming their first album to reach No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, and be certified platinum in the US. The album also produced the singles &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, the former of which was the band's first top-ten UK single. The album was also controversial Ã¢â‚¬â€œ particularly in the US Ã¢â‚¬â€œ due to the religious nature of its lyrics and its artwork.\n\nSince the release of The Number of the Beast and its subsequent tour, The Beast on the Road, &quot;The Beast&quot; has become an alternate name for Iron Maiden, and was later used in the titles of some of their compilations and live releases, including Best of the Beast, The Beast is Rising and Visions of the Beast.\n\nTrack listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Invaders&quot;   \t  \t3:22\n2. \t&quot;Children of the Damned&quot;   \t  \t4:33\n3. \t&quot;The Prisoner&quot;   \tSmith, Harris \t6:00\n4. \t&quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot;   \tHarris, Smith \t6:38\n5. \t&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;   \t  \t4:51\n6. \t&quot;Run to the Hills&quot;   \t  \t3:50\n7. \t&quot;Gangland&quot;   \tSmith, Burr \t3:47\n8. \t&quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;   \t  \t7:10\n\nBonus Disc [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Total Eclipse&quot;   \tHarris, Murray, Burr \t4:26\n2. \t&quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; (live) \tHarris, Paul Di'Anno \t5:29","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35d198d2c3dece6d77d42fb13ff71cdb85a20308","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+The+Number+Of+The+Beast+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35d198d2c3dece6d77d42fb13ff71cdb85a20308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,209,152,210,195,222,206,109,119,212,47,177,63,247,28,219,133,162,3,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
