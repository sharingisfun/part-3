Battle Beast represents the traditional heavy metal sound - Bringing you high screams, old school riffs and strong choruses. In one word: Power.\n\n\nIn May 2010, Battle Beast had its big opportunity to warm up Ex-Iron Maiden singer Blaze Bayley as they were performing in Finland during the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Promise and TerrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½- tour. Battle Beast played in 4 of 5 shows with another metal band Merging Flare on BlazeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tour in finland and the feedback on the gigs was very positive.\n\n\nAfter the short tour, Battle Beast attended to W:O:A Metal Battle in Finland and won the national contest. The prize was to get to play to Wacken Open Air in Germany and represent Finland in the international Metal Battle finals where out of 26 different countries, Battle Beast won the whole thing. They won full endorsements and high quality equipment from Eden, Washburn, Mapex, Paiste, Marshall and Woodbrass. Also an opportunity to sign an international record deal. Battle Beast had many offers from other record companies after winning the Metal Battle 2010.\n\nFinland's Battle Beast are set to release their third studio album, entitled Unholy Savior, on January 9th (Europe), January 12th (UK) and January 13th (North America) via Nuclear Blast.\n\n\nThe album starts with Ã¢â‚¬Å“LionheartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Noora LouhimoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voracious vocals reminiscent of those of Lita Ford. The song was written to be in emulated in Guitar Hero; the velocity of the notes is everything! Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unholy SaviorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ follows, with a brutal void unsettled by beastly grunts, but cut short by a fast progression and a Ã¢â‚¬Å“letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ trajectory.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I Want The World And Everything In ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a mix of classic rock and punk, with a few beasts screams in the background accentuated by soaring solos.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Speed And DangerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“MadnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are the heaviest offerings on this album, exuding fury with each riff, vocal, and lyric, from beginning to end.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Touch In The NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ introduces us to a retro upbeat 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s ballad pattern, which trickles through to Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Black SwordsmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sea Of DreamsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel CryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Do I have to say anything else? ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even a heart beat inspired background and some experimental time signature fantasies glazed with flutes and other atypical metal band instruments. Each of these songs growth in intensity and heaviness is saved for mere seconds at the end.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“HeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s QuestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a background song that is exactly what the title explains. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be surprised if this song ends up in the soundtrack of a movie!\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Far Far AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the most anthemic song IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard from this band to date. I would love to see it performed live, because the power it exudes via the album is immense, live it must be an experience that could move a mountain.\n\n\nIn general, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good album, the down part would probably be the patterns the ballad-like songs seem to follow is similar in structure, slow and calm until the last few seconds; but isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that usual in all bands and musicians of all genres of music nowadays? We just wish they would shake it up a bit, because it is obvious that they can.\n\n\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nEero SipilÃƒÂ¤ - Bass, Backing Vocals\nPyry Vikki - Drums\nNitte Valo - Female Vocals\nJuuso Soinio - Guitars\nAnton Kabanen - Guitars, Vocals\nJanne BjÃƒÂ¶rkroth - Keyboards\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nSteel 2011\nBattle Beast 2013\nUnholy Saviour 2015\n\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
