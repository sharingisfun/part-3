It was released in October 1971.\n\nThe album was recorded at a series of locations around London, including Abbey Road Studios. \nWith no material to work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the band devised \na series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album's signature track, &quot;Echoes&quot;. \nAlthough many of the group's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics \nwritten mainly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member..\n\n\nMeddle\n\n [01] [05:59] - One of These Days\n [02] [05:11] - A Pillow of Winds\n [03] [06:09] - Fearless\n [04] [03:44] - San Tropez\n [05] [02:17] - Seamus\n [06] [23:31] - Echoes\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:46:50\nTotal Size...........: 107.35 MB\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/00114418909230909320.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/00114418909230909320.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nObscured by Clouds the seventh studio album by Pink Floyd, based on their soundtrack for \nthe French film La VallÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, by Barbet Schroeder.

The concept album  built on ideas explored \nby the band in their live shows and earlier recordings, but it lacks the extended instrumental \nexcursions that characterised their work following the departure in 1968 of founding member, \nprincipal composer, and lyricist Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of the Moon's themes include \nconflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by \nBarrett's deteriorating mental state.\n\n\nThe Dark Side Of The Moon\n\n [01] [01:08] - Speak To Me\n [02] [02:49] - Breathe\n [03] [03:51] - On The Run\n [04] [06:50] - Time\n [05] [04:44] - The Great Gig In The Sky\n [06] [06:23] - Money\n [07] [07:50] - Us And Them\n [08] [03:26] - Any Colour You Like\n [09] [03:47] - Brain Damage\n [10] [02:12] - Eclipse\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:42:58\nTotal Size...........: 98.46 MB\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/93573136435749894865.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/93573136435749894865.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, \nreleased in September 1975. Inspired by material they composed while performing across \nEurope, it was recorded over numerous sessions at London's Abbey Road Studios. \nThe album explores themes of absence, the music business, and former band-mate Syd Barrett's \nmental decline. Early sessions were a difficult and arduous process but it was Roger Waters' \nidea to split the centrepiece track &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; in two, and join each half \nwith three new compositions. &quot;Shine On&quot; was a tribute to Barrett, who, coincidentally, \nmade an impromptu visit to the studio while it was being recorded. The band failed \ninitially to recognise Barrett, who had gained weight and changed in appearance.\n\n\n\n [01] [13:31] Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond [Parts IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“V]\n [02] [07:27] Pink Floyd - Welcome to The Machine\n [03] [05:08] Pink Floyd - Have a Cigar\n [04] [05:40] Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here\n [05] [12:23] Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond [Parts VIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IX]\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:44:08\nTotal Size...........: 101.10 MB\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/97705557359921498956.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/97705557359921498956.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnimals is the tenth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, and was \nreleased in January 1977. A concept album, it provides a scathing critique of the social~political \nconditions of 1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. \nAnimals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production \nwas punctuated by the early signs of discord that several years later would culminate in \nkeyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between \ntwo chimneys on Battersea Power Station, was designed by bassist and writer Roger Waters, \nand produced by long-time collaborator Hipgnosis.\n\nAnimals\n\n\n [01] [01:25] - Pigs on the wing 1\n [02] [17:04] - Dogs\n [03] [11:22] - Pigs [Three Different Ones]\n [04] [10:24] - Sheep\n [05] [01:25] - Pigs On The Wing 2\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:41:38\nTotal Size...........: 95.45 MB\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/05546721030097203691.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/05546721030097203691.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Wall is the eleventh studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd. \nIt was released as a double album on 30 November 1979.

It was released in the UK and US in September 1987. In 1985 guitarist \nDavid Gilmour  began to assemble a group of musicians to work on his third solo album. \nAt the end of 1986 he changed his mind, and decided that the new material would instead \nbe included in a new Pink Floyd album. Subsequently Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and \nkeyboardist Richard Wright  (who had left the group in 1979) were brought on board for \nthe project. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, \nhe and Mason helped Gilmour craft what would become the first Pink Floyd album since the \ndeparture of lyricist and bass guitarist Roger Waters in December 1985.\n\n\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason\n\n  [01] [04:23] - Signs of Life\n  [02] [04:52] - Learning to Fly\n  [03] [06:04] - The Dogs of War\n  [04] [05:09] - One Slip\n  [05] [05:41] - On the Turning Away\n  [06] [07:26] - Yet Another Movie 6a./Round and Around\n  [07] [01:46] - A New Machine [part 1]\n  [08] [06:15] - Terminal Frost\n  [09] [00:39] - A New Machine [part 2]\n  [10] [08:48] - Sorrow\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:50:59\nTotal Size...........: 117.11 MB\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/63345149551382441994.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/63345149551382441994.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Division Bell is the fourteenth and last studio album by English progressive rock \ngroup Pink Floyd.
