The native New Yorker picked up two Grammy Awards for SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So Unusual, and over the years has remained in the limelight as a recording star, club favorite, Broadway composer, fashion icon and LGBT rights activist.\nOn April 1, Legacy Recordings celebrate the 30th anniversary of LauperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album with a reissue available in 1-CD, 2-CD and 1-LP formats. The centerpiece of the campaign is the 2-CD edition, which feature never-before-released demos, rehearsals, live performances and more. All three editions also boast three new remixes, hardly an unusual move for an artist whose music still reverberates on the dancefloor.\n\nLauperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex is in the Heel,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from her Tony Award-winning musical Kinky Boots, was a Top 10 Dance hit in the U.S. even before the show opened on Broadway.\n\nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So Unusual marked LauperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creative freedom following the break-up of her band Blue Angel.  In addition to four tracks co-written by Lauper including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time After Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the LP repertoire included tracks by Prince (Ã¢â‚¬Å“When You Were MineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Robert Hazard (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls Just Want to Have FunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Jules Shear (Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Through the NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Lauper co-write Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Kiss YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), former Hollies member Mikael Rickfors (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yeah, YeahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and even the late Al Sherman, father of Disney Legends Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman (the brief title track, written as Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So UnusualÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the 1920s!).\n\nFive singles were released from the Portrait Records album, and all five reached the Billboard Hot 100Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Top 30 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls Just Want to Have Fun,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time After Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Bop,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Through the NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Money Changes Everything.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  The first four all shot to the Top 5, with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time After TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reaching the coveted No. 1 spot and Ã¢â‚¬Å“GirlsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ not far behind at No. 2.  Produced by Rick Chertoff and featuring Rob Hyman and Eric Bazilian of the band The Hooters as well as Brill Building legend Ellie Greenwich on background vocals, SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So Unusual made Lauper the first female artist to have four Top 10 singles on a debut album. It went on to sell over 16 million copies worldwide and netted Grammys for Best Album Package as well as for Lauper as Best New Artist.  Her unique fashion sense and bold, colorful personality also made her a natural for the nascent music video form, and she picked up an MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls Just Want to Have Fun.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAll formats of SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s So Unusual include three new remixes of album tracks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Yolanda Be Cool remix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls Just Want to Have FunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Nervo and Bent Collective remixes of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time After Time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The 2-CD edition includes a nine-track second disc, with demos of Ã¢â‚¬Å“GirlsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (two different versions) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Money Changes EverythingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ plus rehearsal recordings of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rules and RegulationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Through the Night,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a 1984 live performance from Boston of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Witness,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Arthur BakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“She-Bop,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a rough mix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time After Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the non-LP B-side Ã¢â‚¬Å“Right Train, Wrong Track,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ co-written by Lauper, Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Kent.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m always looking forward, trying to do something thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new and different,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ states Lauper in connection with the upcoming reissue. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But every once in a while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good to look back and celebrate. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always been proud of this album, with the statement we made and, most importantly, what it has meant to my fans, I want to thank them for all the years of support,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Lauper.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6bd2bf217580a141594da94becf8c842cfc6b61","amp;dn":"Cyndi+Lauper+-+She%26rsquo%3Bs+So+Unusual+A+30th+Anniversary+Celebra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6bd2bf217580a141594da94becf8c842cfc6b61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,189,43,242,23,88,10,20,21,148,218,148,190,207,140,132,44,252,107,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
