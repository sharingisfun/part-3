All songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott.\n\nIt was originally released in Australia on the Albert Productions label. A modified international edition was released on Atlantic Records on 25 July 1977.\n\nAs with AC/DC's previous albums, there are differences between Let There Be Rock's Australian and ultimate international editions. The original vinyl version of the album made available for international release contained the same tracks as the Australian release. However, Atlantic Records removed the racy &quot;Crabsody In Blue&quot; (about the problems of crabs) from the later international version. It was replaced with a shortened version of &quot;Problem Child&quot; from the Australian version of the album Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, released in September 1976. &quot;Crabsody In Blue&quot; was later released on the box set Backtracks, which was released in 2009. All international CD releases contain the modified track listing.\n\nThe international version's cover also marked the debut of the band's logo, designed by Gerard Huerta. The photograph used for the cover was taken on 19 March 1977 at the Kursaal Ballroom, Southend, Essex, UK\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Go Down&quot; \t5:31\n2. \t&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;   \t3:34\n3. \t&quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;   \t6:06\n4. \t&quot;Bad Boy Boogie&quot;   \t4:27\n5. \t&quot;Problem Child&quot;   \t5:24\n6. \t&quot;Overdose&quot;   \t6:09\n7. \t&quot;Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be&quot;  \t4:14\n8. \t&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;   \t5:24\n\nOdds And Sods\n\n1. \t&quot;Crabsody In Blue&quot;\t4:43\n2. \t&quot;Carry Me Home&quot;   \t3:57\n3. \t&quot;Dog Eat Dog [LIVE]&quot;   \t4:30\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11dce35aa5216f3f17395c7a6d87695c422fa3c2","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+Let+There+Be+Rock+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11dce35aa5216f3f17395c7a6d87695c422fa3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,220,227,90,165,33,111,63,23,57,92,122,109,135,105,92,66,47,163,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
