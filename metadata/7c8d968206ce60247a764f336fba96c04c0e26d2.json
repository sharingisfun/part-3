Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost twin-engine airliner derived from Boeing's 707 and 727, the 737 has developed into a family of nine passenger models with a capacity of 85 to 215 passengers.\n\nOriginally envisioned in 1964, the initial 737-100 flew in 1967 and entered airline service in February 1968. Next the lengthened 737-200 entered service in April 1968. The 737-200c with gravel kit was released shortly thereafter in an attempt to capture the short runway market. The plane is still used today by several airlines in northern Canada, Alaska and several other countries where gravel runways are the norm.\n\nThe 737 series is the best-selling jet airliner in the history of aviation.\n\n(source Wikipedia with edits and additions)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c8d968206ce60247a764f336fba96c04c0e26d2","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%2FP3D2%5D++Boeing+737-200c+-+Milviz+SP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c8d968206ce60247a764f336fba96c04c0e26d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,141,150,130,6,206,96,36,122,118,79,51,111,186,150,192,76,14,38,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
