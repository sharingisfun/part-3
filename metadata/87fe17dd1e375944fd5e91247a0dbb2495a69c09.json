Kordemsky\r\nDover Publications | April 1992 | ISBN-10: 0486270785 | ePUB | 24.7 mb\r\n\r\nThis is, quite simply, the best and most popular puzzle book ever published in the Soviet Union. Since its first appearance in 1956 there have been eight editions as well as translations from the original Russian into Ukrainian, Estonian, Lettish, and Lithuanian. Almost a million copies of the Russian version alone have been sold.\r\nPart of the reason for the book's success is its marvelously varied assortment of brainteasers ranging from simple &quot;catch&quot; riddles to difficult problems (none, however, requiring advanced mathematics). Many of the puzzles will be new to Western readers, while some familiar problems have been clothed in new forms. Often the puzzles are presented in the form of charming stories that provide non-Russian readers with valuable insights into contemporary Russian life and customs. In addition, Martin Gardner, former editor of the Mathematical Games Department, Scientific American, has clarified and simplified the book to make it as easy as possible for an English-reading public to understand and enjoy. He has been careful, moreover, to retain nearly all the freshness, warmth, and humor of the original.\r\nLavishly illustrated with over 400 clear diagrams and amusing sketches, this inexpensive edition of the first English translation will offer weeks or even months of stimulating entertainment. It belongs in the library of every puzzlist or lover of recreational mathematics.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nI.Amusing Problems\r\nII.Difficult Problems\r\nIII.Geometry with Matches\r\nIV.Measure Seven Times Before You Cut\r\nV.Skill Will Find Its Application Everywhere\r\nVI.Dominoes and Dice\r\nVII.Properties of Nine\r\nVIII.With Algebra and without It\r\nIX.Mathematics with Almost No Calculations\r\nX.Mathematical Games and Tricks\r\nXI.Divisibility\r\nXII.Cross Sums and Magic Squares\r\nXIII.Numbers Curious and Serious\r\nXIV.Numbers Ancient but Eternally Young\r\nAnswers\r\nIndex\r\n \nhttps://s33.postimg.org/ijwpkeaj3/The_Moscow_Puzzles_359_Mathematical_Recreation.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87fe17dd1e375944fd5e91247a0dbb2495a69c09","amp;dn":"The+Moscow+Puzzles+-+359+Mathematical+Recreations+%28gnv46%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87fe17dd1e375944fd5e91247a0dbb2495a69c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,254,23,221,30,55,89,68,253,94,145,36,122,13,187,36,149,166,156,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
