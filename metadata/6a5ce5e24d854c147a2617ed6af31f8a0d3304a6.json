Author Paul F. Aubin details how to transfer your files and explains key distinctions between the packages. Along the way, learn how to customize the Revit settings for optimal control, get a basic handle on the modeling tools, and adjust yourself to the differences in visibility, plot style, object creation, and the user interface.\nTopics include:\n\n    Comparing AutoCAD and Revit\n    Customizing Revit settings\n    Exploring the Revit interface\n    Organizing with categories versus layers\n    Understanding families and groups versus blocks\n    Using links instead of Xrefs\n    Tracing, nesting, and exploding CAD files\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a5ce5e24d854c147a2617ed6af31f8a0d3304a6","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Migrating+from+AutoCAD+to+Revit+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a5ce5e24d854c147a2617ed6af31f8a0d3304a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,92,229,226,77,133,76,20,122,38,23,237,106,243,31,138,13,51,4,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
