Wright's act is captured on his 1985 album I Have a Pony, recorded live at Wolfgang's in San Francisco and Park West in Chicago. His absurdist style is a weirder slant on the kind of observations of everyday life provided by other comics -- Jerry Seinfeld for instance. It's amazing that I Have a Pony is actually broken down and labeled with individual tracks since the vast majority of Wright's material is rarely more than a sentence or two each. Wright's priceless bits include buying powdered water but not knowing what to add; buying used paint in the shape of a house; putting a humidifier and a dehumidifier in a room and letting them fight it out; 6,000 ants dressing up as rice to rob a Chinese restaurant; and keeping his large seashell collection on beaches all over the world. A joke that seems to obviously be about the Rolling Stones is actually about The Flintstones. Two of his best jokes on I Have a Pony actually have a brief buildup; he tells &quot;a beautiful blonde Asian woman&quot; who's a nymphomaniac turned on by Jewish cowboys that his name is Bucky Goldstein, and on &quot;Jiggs Casey&quot; he tells the student loan director from his bank that instead of making his payments he's given his money to his friend who used it to build a nuclear weapon -- and he'd appreciate not being bothered anymore. Wright strums a bit of acoustic guitar and sings on the girlfriend tale &quot;Rachel,&quot; but first he teases the audience and says he's going to play everything the Beatles ever recorded -- without doing all of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;!\n\n\n\nTracks\n \t \t \t \t\n\n1 Introduction\t\t4:14\n2 Ants\t\t        4:42\n3 Hitchhiking\t\t2:13\n4 Ice\t\t        2:28\n5 Dog Stay\t\t3:27\n6 Rachel\t\t4:50\n7 7's and Museums\t4:01\n8 Water\t\t        3:06\n9 Jiggs Casey\t\t3:03\n10 Cross Country\t2:15\n11 Book Store\t\t1:25\n12 Winny\t\t1:28\n13 Apt.\t\t        2:08\n14 Babies and Skiing\t2:22\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41fa3a4a22b918bddd709e08497a39301182200f","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Steven+Wright+-+I+have+a+Pony+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41fa3a4a22b918bddd709e08497a39301182200f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,250,58,74,34,185,24,189,221,112,158,8,73,122,57,48,17,130,32,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
