The band released only two albums during its first seven years, and finally found mainstream success with a self-titled release in 1996. It proved to be Sublime's last proper album, however, as lead singer Brad Nowell died in May 1996, just two months before the record's release.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002, MCA released Robbin' the Hood/Sublime, which contained two albums -- Robbin' the Hood (1996, originally released on MCA) and Sublime (1996, also originally on MCA) -- by Sublime on one compact disc.\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Waiting For Bud\n02.Steady B Loop Dub\n03.Raleigh Soliloquy Pt.
