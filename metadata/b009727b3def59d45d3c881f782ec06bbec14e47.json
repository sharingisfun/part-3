Peter C. Vollhardt and Neil E. Schore\r\nW. H. Freeman | January 2014 | ISBN-10: 1464120277 | True PDF | 1223 pages | 31.8 mb \nhttp://bcs.whfreeman.com/organic7e/#t_921711____\r\n\r\nWith authors who are both accomplished researchers and educators, Vollhardt and Schore's Organic Chemistry takes a functional group approach with a heavy emphasis on understanding how the structure of a molecule determines how that molecule will function in chemical reactions. By understanding the connection between structure and function, students will be better prepared to understand mechanisms and solve practical problems in organic chemistry. The new edition brings in the latest research breakthroughs and applications, expanded problem-solving help, and new online homework options.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nK. Peter C. Vollhardt was born in Madrid, raised in Buenos Aires and Munich, studied at the University of Munich, got his Ph.D. with Professor Peter Garratt at the University College, London, and was a postdoctoral fellow with Professor Bob Bergman (then) at the California Institute of Technology. He moved to Berkeley in 1974. He is the current Chief Editor of Synlett. Among his more than 350 publications, he treasures especially this textbook in organic chemistry, translated into 13 languages. Peter is married to Marie-Jos Sat, a French artist, and they have two children, Paloma (b. 1994) and Julien (b. 1997).\r\nNeil E. Schore was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1948 and educated in public schools in the Bronx, New York, and Ridgefield, New Jersey. He completed a B.A. with honors in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1969. Schore has taught organic chemistry to more than 15,000 nonchemistry majors, winning seven teaching awards, publishing over 100 papers in various areas related to organic chemistry, and refereeing several hundred local youth soccer games.  Neil is married to Carrie Erickson, a microbiologist at the UC-Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. They have two children, Michael (b. 1981) and Stefanie (b. 1983).\r\n\r\nBRIEF CONTENTS\r\nPREFACE: A Userâ€™s Guide to ORGANIC CHEMISTRY: Structure and Function xxv\r\n1 STRUCTURE AND BONDING IN ORGANIC MOLECULES 1\r\n2 STRUCTURE AND REACTIVITY 49\r\n3 REACTIONS OF ALKANES 97\r\n4 CYCLOALKANES 131\r\n5 STEREOISOMERS 167\r\n6 PROPERTIES AND REACTIONS OF HALOALKANES 211\r\n7 FURTHER REACTIONS OF HALOALKANES 247\r\n8 HYDROXY FUNCTIONAL GROUP: ALCOHOLS 279\r\n9 FURTHER REACTIONS OF ALCOHOLS AND THE CHEMISTRY OF ETHERS 325\r\n10 USING NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY TO DEDUCE STRUCTURE 377\r\n11 ALKENES: INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY AND MASS SPECTROMETRY 433\r\n12 REACTIONS OF ALKENES 483\r\n13 ALKYNES 541\r\n14 DELOCALIZED PI SYSTEMS 579\r\n15 BENZENE AND AROMATICITY 641\r\n16 ELECTROPHILIC ATTACK ON DERIVATIVES OF BENZENE 695\r\n17 ALDEHYDES AND KETONES 737\r\n18 ENOLS, ENOLATES, AND THE ALDOL CONDENSATION 789\r\n19 CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 833\r\n20 CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVES 885\r\n21 AMINES AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 933\r\n22 CHEMISTRY OF BENZENE SUBSTITUENTS 979\r\n23 ESTER ENOLATES AND THE CLAISEN CONDENSATION 1039\r\n24 CARBOHYDRATES 1073\r\n25 HETEROCYCLES 1121\r\n26 AMINO ACIDS, PEPTIDES, PROTEINS, AND NUCLEIC ACIDS 1165\r\nAnswers to Exercises A-1\r\nPhotograph Credits C-1\r\nIndex I-1\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/pohgi45p1/Organic_Chemistry_Structure_and_Function_7th.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b009727b3def59d45d3c881f782ec06bbec14e47","amp;dn":"Organic+Chemistry+-+Structure+and+Function+%287th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b009727b3def59d45d3c881f782ec06bbec14e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,9,114,123,61,239,89,212,93,60,136,31,120,46,192,107,190,193,78,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
