After discovering the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Anno Domini High Definition in 2009, Riverside has sneakily become one of the staples of my playlist. I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t completely enamored with Shrine of New Generation Slaves; but its chill, more reflective moments are the ones that I keep coming back to: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Depth of Self Delusion,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ yes, but especially, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Got Used to Us,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which has a slow groove and a transcendent chorus. Still, SoNGS lacked the punch and progressive drive that ADHDÃ¢â‚¬â€and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier materialÃ¢â‚¬â€had, and landed far more in the territory of post-Marillion prog, without the brooding darkness into which late Gazpacho has wandered recently. SoNGS was, arguably, nothing more or less than a road sign, though, pointing towards 2015Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s latest record: Love, Fear and the Time Machine.\n\nLove, Fear and the Time Machine is a subtle, calm album: defined almost more by its feel than by its songs. The record, at least at first blush, could be accused of being uniformÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly in comparison to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier material. At an hour long, I have to admit I was gearing up for a gentle reminder that quantity is not quality. But similar to Riverside 2015-1staring at 3D Stereogram for a while, Love, Fear and the Time Machine opened up before me and started to take form and definition. It proved to be worth the wait. Like its predecessor, this record is mellow; but the band has started to perfect the formula. There is very little of the heavy, urgent material that littered the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earliest material. Aside from about 3 minutes in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Towards the Blue Horizon,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the bands heaviest moments sound a lot more akin to Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s British melancholic rock (see: Ã¢â‚¬Å“#AddictedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) than Riverside circa 2004.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69ac3ddd7902ae2af7a6a7179cb1685dd39c8a4","amp;dn":"Riverside+-+Love%2C+Fear+and+the+Time+Machine+%28Limited+Edition%29BBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69ac3ddd7902ae2af7a6a7179cb1685dd39c8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,154,195,221,215,144,42,226,175,122,106,113,121,203,22,133,221,57,200,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
