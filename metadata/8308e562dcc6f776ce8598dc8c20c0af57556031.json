His music is often very much an acquired taste. And some of his most brilliant tracks are simply too much for first time listeners unaccustomed to his style. \n\nWith this in mind, I've created a compilation for MF DOOM entitled &quot;An Introduction: The Best Of DOOM&quot; -- not really a collection of purely his best songs, but his most accessible songs -- tracks that would help ease a head into DOOM's music and style. \n\nMF DOOM is among the most enigmatic figures in Hip-Hop, and a man with more than a few aliases. Most notably known as MF DOOM, with MF standing for Metal Face or Metal Fingers, his alter egos include: Viktor Vaughn, King Geedorah, Danger Doom (with Dangermouse), Madvillain (with Madlib), and The SuperVillain. I have placed the alias he uses in parenthesis next to each song in the tracklist.\n\nHis rhyme flow and structure is both brilliant and unorthodox, with shades of both Nas and Kool G Rap, and an originality that is truly all his own. Listening to Jay Electronica, one of the games dopest new MCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, you can hear DOOMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence in both delivery and style. It is this unorthodox style that DOOM brings that fans fell in love withÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and it has also served as a double-edged sword; his delivery, as well as musical directions, can take some getting used to.\n\nHis lyrical content is also Ã¢â‚¬Å“love-or-hateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for many Hip-Hop fans. I think most fans who love DOOM, like myself, would agree that his lyrics and subject matter, metaphors and similes, often go over the head of the average listener, alienating a lot of heads. So I say this: MF DOOM is not for everyone. Plain and simple. It would be fair to say that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll either love him or you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like him at all. But trust me when I say, the more you listen to him, the more you will like him. He is an acquired taste for many. I hope you give him a chance. One love \n-Real HipHopHead\n\n01.
