She is an ardent fan of film actor, Suryakant, and her one ambition in life is to meet and act with him. She runs away to Madras, and like, hundreds of young women, lines up outside Jupiter Studios to try and get noticed. With her plain, next-door-girl looks, she gets ignored but as fate could have it she is given a chance to play a minor role after she manages to sneak into the studios. The role exploits her as a sex symbol, driving males to the cinema houses to absorb her movements and beauty. Virtually overnight she, now renamed Silk, becomes a sensation, and together with the aging superstar, Suryakant, the one she had always fantasized about, she sizzles the silver screen with her sex appeal. Suryakant's brother, Ramakant, an author, is smitten by her - so much so that he would like her to opt out of movies altogether...\n\n\n\nDirector: Milan Luthria\n\nStars:            Vidya Balan, Emraan Hashmi and Tusshar Kapoor\nimdb:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954206/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954206/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/kLBeG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/kLBeG.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/xIvWk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/xIvWk.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/yLfUO.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/yLfUO.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/MsiIh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/MsiIh.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE THEN DO BUY THE ORIGINAL BLURAY/DVD\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce24c0acb8b2958589fc3ac690d4c0449e56237d","amp;dn":"The+Dirty+Picture+%282011%29+720p+BRrip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce24c0acb8b2958589fc3ac690d4c0449e56237d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,36,192,172,184,178,149,133,137,252,58,198,144,212,192,68,158,86,35,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
