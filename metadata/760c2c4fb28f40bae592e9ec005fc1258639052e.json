Although some vegetables, such as tomatoes and pole beans, have been grown vertically for a very long time, it is only recently that gardeners who are short on space have looked to vertical methods and structures for growing vegetables that traditionally have been thought to require a lot of horizontal space. Vertical Vegetable Gardening provides information on growing all types of leafy, root, and other vegetables vertically, saving space, protecting from insects, and making harvesting easier. Now people living in urban areas can grow produce that used to require sizable plots of land. Also included are ideas and plans for vertical structures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:760c2c4fb28f40bae592e9ec005fc1258639052e","amp;dn":"+Vertical+Vegetable+Gardening%3A+A+Living+Free+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"760c2c4fb28f40bae592e9ec005fc1258639052e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,12,44,79,178,143,64,186,229,146,233,236,0,95,193,37,134,57,5,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
