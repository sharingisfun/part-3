Although it does not feature the track &quot;Wenyukela (Ascend Higher)&quot;, from their successful March 2003 release &quot;Raise Your Spirit Higher&quot;, it does however feature other tracks from the album. These include the stirring &quot;Wenza Ngani? (How Did You Do That?)&quot;, a song about a man &amp;#039;transforming&amp;#039; another man from a racist to a &amp;#039;non-racist&amp;#039;. The brilliant track &quot;Inkanyezi Nezazi (The Star and the Wiseman)&quot;, used so succesfully on the Heinz Soup 1998 ad campaign, is also listed here - whilst a wonderful rendition of the classic hymn &quot;Silent Night&quot;, sung in Black Mambazo&amp;#039;s unique style and a live version of &quot;Nomathemba (Mother of Hope)&quot; finishes off this wonderful collection. (Incidentally, the former track is based on a true story that Ladysmith&amp;#039;s lead singer Joseph Shabalala endured in the early 1960&amp;#039;s). A nicely compiled album. \n\nTrack Listings \nDisc: 1  \n1. Rain rain Beautiful Rain  \n2. How long ?.  \n3. Inkanyezi Nezazi  \n4. Swing Low Sweet Chariot  \n5.
