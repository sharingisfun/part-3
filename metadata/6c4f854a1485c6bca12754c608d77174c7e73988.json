Apple Records is celebrating the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s endurance with the release of TimelessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The Musical Legacy.\nThe 16-track compilation draws on all four of BadfingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Apple albums from 1970 to 1973 (Magic Christian Music, No Dice, Straight Up, and Ass), only overlooking Maybe Tomorrow, released under the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original name of The Iveys. The Warner Bros. years are represented by 1974Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Wish You Were Here, and the compilation concludes with a track from the 1979 Elektra LP Airwaves.\nAll of the Apple tracks have been derived from the 2010 remasters. McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Come and Get It,Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nso memorably utilized in the off-the-wall Peter Sellers/Ringo Starr comedy The Magic Christian, is one of four tracks from Magic Christian Music (naturally).   Three songs have been taken from No Dice, including Ham and EvansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ future chart-topper for Harry Nilsson and Mariah Carey, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Without You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and HamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rocking Ã¢â‚¬Å“No Matter What.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  In addition to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby Blue,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Straight Up is also represented by two George Harrison productions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ HamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immortal Ã¢â‚¬Å“Day After DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (with George on slide guitar!) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Name of the GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus Joey MollandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suitcase.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  From the 2010 expanded edition of Straight Up, the group composition Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be the OneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has also been selected; Harrison reportedly nixed the song from the original LP for being Ã¢â‚¬Å“too Beatley.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Just two songs have been lifted from Apple farewell Ass: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Apple of My EyeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Timeless,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both Ham songs.  HamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“DennisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ appears from Wish You Were Here, while MollandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love is Gonna Come At LastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the sole pick from Airwaves.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c4f854a1485c6bca12754c608d77174c7e73988","amp;dn":"Badfinger+-+Timeless%26hellip%3B+The+Musical+Legacy+%282013%29+MP3%40320kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c4f854a1485c6bca12754c608d77174c7e73988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,79,133,74,20,133,198,188,161,39,84,198,8,215,113,116,199,231,57,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
