They combined good songwriting, a sense of humor and decent charisma into a commerically powerful brew that carried a half dozen or so of their singles onto the US charts. Their first two albums, &quot;Business as Usual&quot; and &quot;Cargo&quot; were massive sellers and I will admit to having played them on vinyl until they were worn out. Unfortunately, their success went to their heads and after a dreadful attempt to be taken seriously with their 1985 third album &quot;Two Hearts,&quot; they faded into obscurity. \r\nTheir greatest hits album features enough of their best moments from those first two albums to make it worthwhile for anyone interested in the nostalgia. Unfortunately, it also contains a number of songs from their disasterous third album that weaken the overall package. Nevertheless, if you loved pop gems such as &quot;Who Can it Be Now?&quot; &quot;Down Under,&quot; &quot;Be Good Johnny&quot; and &quot;Overkill,&quot; this album is for you. It also gets a bonus star for including the lengthy &quot;Down by the Sea,&quot; which is the excellent non-hit closing track from the first album","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a0cd9882ae7dda2dfc342e66cf874a665948ee","amp;dn":"Men+At+Work+-+The+Best+Of+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a0cd9882ae7dda2dfc342e66cf874a665948ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,160,205,152,130,174,125,218,45,252,52,46,102,207,135,74,102,89,72,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
