In the game, the player controls the crew of a pirate ship. The player must sail the ship over a number of sea zones, each with events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing against pirates and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew members, keeping discipline and outfitting and upgrading their ship and many more. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or the crew lost, the game ends, requiring the player to restart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6f637529524e3c9261b5693a0440135409c1eca","amp;dn":"Pixel+Piracy+0.4.0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6f637529524e3c9261b5693a0440135409c1eca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,246,55,82,149,36,227,201,38,27,86,147,160,68,1,53,64,156,30,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
