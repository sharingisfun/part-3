The game is currently in alpha and contains a wide range of single player content including:\r\n\r\n    A creative mode allowing you to push your designs to the limit and ensure the total annihilation of your opponents.\r\n    A campaign waged over hundreds of islands against eight unique factions.\r\n    A Story Mode where you can (eventually!) play 15 missions as each of the eight factions - a fantastic mixture of strategy, design and wild battles! Defend your fleet against waves of enemy forces in a series of extremely tough challenges that unlock new components. \r\n\r\nAn expansive multiplayer and co-op element is planned for the coming months!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c16eef4c4159f6b33bdd202f9dfe59fa69bc7d","amp;dn":"From+the+Depths+v1.915","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c16eef4c4159f6b33bdd202f9dfe59fa69bc7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,193,110,239,76,65,89,246,179,59,221,32,47,157,254,89,250,105,188,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
