After his suggestion/permission, I went through all 3 PDFs and added working links so you can use the glossary now which is much more convenient. I also included the Skyrim manual.\n\nThese are the same as the original PDFs except with working links/glossaries which makes this version much more convenient.\n\nOriginal uploaders description:\nWell, Someone had to do it... I pieced together all the pages from the online prima guide and worked it into PDF format. I separated the Essentials, Walkthrough and Maps into 3 separate PDF's, because having it all together was just too damn big.\n\n\nOriginal version credit - Cloonman\n\nUpdated version credit - enemy2k\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a6a9954fa35628e5f3e2e8f0dde3ca290e4036","amp;dn":"Skyrim+Prima+Guide+PDFs+%5Bworking+glossaries%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a6a9954fa35628e5f3e2e8f0dde3ca290e4036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,166,169,149,79,163,86,40,229,243,226,232,240,221,227,202,41,14,64,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
