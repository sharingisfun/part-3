We intended to provide an authentic and not commercially edited, English translation. It is earnestly requested of other speakers of languages such as Deutsch, Italiano, Francais, Espanol, and others, that they create their translation based upon this English version. The English version is free from fear or favour (to politics and to the Japanese nation), neutral and true to the spirit and letter of the original Japanese script.\n\nIn translating this final work by Mr Hayao Miyazaki, the intention is to keep the original spoken JapaneseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegance using a classical, dignified British English style. The Japanese used in this movie is mainly pre-WW2, when people used elegant, classical speech. Just look at the English films of that era and you will hear instead of Ã¢â‚¬Å“whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ how do you do? Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \n\n In any language, especially between East and West, it is not possible to give a perfect translation. It is akin to translating Sir Francis BaconÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s [Hamlet] into Japanese. The verse Ã¢â‚¬Å“ To be, or not to beÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ simply does not have any counterpart in Japanese language.  Hence, after hundreds of translations, only those Japanese who can read Sir FrancisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ original work in archaic English can appreciate the beauty of it. Therefore, where necessary, the translators included explanatory notes in parenthesis, or added intended words as Japanese conversations usually omit many components, such as the subject, numbers, verbs, etc.\n\nListening to the spoken Japanese, especially between Jiro and Naoko, the translators were moved to such degree, the latters pushed themselves to compleat the translations as soon as possible. The protagonist and his counter-part, who later becomes his beloved consort, speak to each other in such beautiful, respectful classical Japanese. This kind of elegant Japanese is not heard anywhere in Japan today, except in rare cases in traditional families still appreciate to raise children in such way. \n \nThe only regret in this movie is that the male protagonistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voiceover artist doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t express the depth of emotion required. For, in animation, we cannot see the faces of actors and actresses, so are reliant on the voice alone to transmit emotion to the audience. The male voice of the protagonist failed in this regard. \nAs for the female voice of the heroine, as she stated in the interview on Japanese TV, it was a divine match. No words can express the beauty of how she speaks, the timing of the words, the adorable and fantastically feminine voice of the slowly dying heroine. The voiceover artist did a perfect job. The audience are urged to listen carefully to her voice. NaokoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breathing stops when speaking, slight pause between the words, tones and intonations. The female voiceover artist expresses everything that needs to be communicated in a masterful voiceover. The superbly drawn figures of this animation leave an unforgettable impression and memories in our minds. This is indeed Magnum Opus of the Maestro Hayao Miyazaki. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cec0def86afa7aaa675a629e9664f9e60267842","amp;dn":"The.Wind.Rises.2013.DVDSCR.Xvid+-+Copy.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cec0def86afa7aaa675a629e9664f9e60267842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,236,13,239,134,175,167,170,166,117,166,41,233,102,79,158,96,38,120,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
