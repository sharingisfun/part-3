Deployed on hundreds of dangerous operations to bring down terrorists, killers and hostage takers, he has been behind some of the UK's most controversial police shootings. But it was the death of Azelle Rodney that landed him in court for murder and brought his career to a devastating end. \r\n\r\nSpeaking for the first time on television, in this Secret History film Long reveals what it is like to shoot and kill people in the line of duty, and how his life crumbled around him during the Rodney case. He explores the complex relationship the police have with firearms 50 years after the force first began carrying arms in the UK, and exposes the personal cost that officers face when they take the lives of others in the name of the law.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/31/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/68/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/52/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/73/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f7/Secrets-of-a-Police-Marksman-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2037Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~124Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 733 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/secrets-of-a-police-marksman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69aba803b85c61ce44c35604961724764f2a04cf","amp;dn":"Ch4+Secret+History+Secrets+of+a+Police+Marksman+720p+x264+AAC+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69aba803b85c61ce44c35604961724764f2a04cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,171,168,3,184,92,97,206,68,195,86,4,150,23,36,118,79,42,4,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
