Yet many IT\r\nprofessionals never really learn how it's done. This course\r\nis designed to change that, providing a baseline\r\nunderstanding of databases and their mechanics. Adam\r\nWilbert covers normalization, a table structuring technique\r\nthat reduces data redundancy; primary, foreign, and\r\ncomposite keys-features supporting the table relationships\r\nthat underlie relational databases; and indexing, which\r\nhelps speed up data retrieval. Along the way, Adam will\r\nprovide tips for working with SQL Server Management Studio\r\nand some challenges to help you practice what you've\r\nlearned\r\nNote: This course will also prepare certification\r\ncandidates for the &quot;Understanding data storage&quot; domain of\r\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Exam 98-364\r\nDatabase Administration Fundamentals.
