Now, Arduino makes it easy. With this book and an Arduino microcontroller and software creation environment, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to build and program a robot that can roam around, sense its environment, and perform a wide variety of tasks. All you to get started with the fun projects is a little programming experience and a keen interest in electronics.\n\nMake a robot that obeys your every commandÃ¢â‚¬â€or runs on its own.\n\nMaybe youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a teacher who wants to show students how to build devices that can move, sense, respond, and interact with the physical world. Or perhaps youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a hobbyist looking for a robot companion to make your world a little more futuristic. With Make an Arduino Controlled Robot, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to build and customize smart robots on wheels.\n\nYou will:\n\n- Explore robotics concepts like movement, obstacle detection, sensors, and remote control\n- Use Arduino to build two- and four-wheeled robots\n- Put your robot in motion with motor shields, servos, and DC motors\n- Work with distance sensors, infrared reflectance sensors, and remote control receivers\n- Understand how to program your robot to take on all kinds of real-world physical challenges","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73124b9d931400d19df0a6277a7adf967f09675c","amp;dn":"Make+an+Arduino-Controlled+Robot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73124b9d931400d19df0a6277a7adf967f09675c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,18,75,157,147,20,0,209,157,240,166,39,122,122,223,150,127,9,103,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
