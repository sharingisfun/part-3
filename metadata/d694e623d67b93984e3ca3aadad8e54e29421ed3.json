A legendary work when it came out, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still sounding light years ahead of its time, music from a future too far away to contemplate. One of, if not THE most accessible yet ground-breaking albums they did in the seventies. You gotta listen for yourself, an essential classic full blown krautrock gem that is a must-have.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Krautrock is a German avant-garde / experimental rock movement that emerged at the end of the 1960's. The term krautrock was originally a humorous one coined by the UK music press (such as New Musical Express and Melody Maker), where &quot;krautrock&quot; found an early and enthusiastic underground following. \nJulian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says &quot;Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon,&quot; based on the way the music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew.  The term is also a problematic category due to the considerable differences between the artists so labelled.\nKey artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon DÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¼l II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.\n\n\n\n \n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d694e623d67b93984e3ca3aadad8e54e29421ed3","amp;dn":"Faust+-+So+Far+1972+%2F+2000+Reissue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d694e623d67b93984e3ca3aadad8e54e29421ed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,148,230,35,214,123,147,152,78,60,163,170,218,216,229,78,41,66,30,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
