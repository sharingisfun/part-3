Manga/Anime community on Swedish.\n\nBrought to you by:\n\nK-A-Z-H-U\n\nNo virus in here, i assure you.\n\n(PS. This is a lot better than RPG Maker XP.\n&quot;RPG Maker is a program that allows users to create their own role-playing games. Most versions include a tile set based map editor, (tilesets are called chipsets in pre-XP versions), a simple scripting language for scripting events, and a battle editor. All versions include initial premade tilesets, characters, and events which can be used in creating new games. An interesting feature of the PC Versions of RPG Maker programs is that a user can create new tilesets and characters, and add any new graphics he/she wants. Several sites have developed, dedicated to helping users share their creations.&quot;\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a67a98faa6da5d6ce072436ef37cf199ba7bdbd","amp;dn":"RPG+Maker+2003+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a67a98faa6da5d6ce072436ef37cf199ba7bdbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,103,169,143,170,109,165,214,206,7,36,54,239,55,207,25,155,167,189,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
