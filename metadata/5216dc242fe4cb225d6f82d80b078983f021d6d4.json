The regular Calculus textbook has an entire chapter (Chapter 6: Inverse Functions) dedicated to transcendental functions while the Early Transcendental version includes each of those sections in other chapters.\n\nTherefore, although the section and chapter numbers may differ, this book contains the solutions to all the problems found in the regular Calculus textbook. In order to find the section that corresponds to the problems in your textbook, please refer to the index at the beginning of this book.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5216dc242fe4cb225d6f82d80b078983f021d6d4","amp;dn":"Stewart+Calculus+7+Edition+%5BSolutions+Manual+Chapters+1-11%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5216dc242fe4cb225d6f82d80b078983f021d6d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,22,220,36,47,228,203,34,93,111,130,216,11,7,137,131,240,33,214,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
