Polya, How to Solve It will show anyone in any field how to think straight.\n\nIn lucid and appealing prose, Polya reveals how the mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown can be of help in attacking any problem that can be &quot;reasoned&quot; out--from building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. Generations of readers have relished Polya's deft--indeed, brilliant--instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of the problem.\n\nIn this best-selling classic, George PÃƒÂ³lya revealed how the mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown can be of help in attacking any problem that can be &quot;reasoned&quot; out--from building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. Generations of readers have relished PÃƒÂ³lya's deft instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of a problem. How to Solve It popularized heuristics, the art and science of discovery and invention. It has been in print continuously since 1945 and has been translated into twenty-three different languages.\n\nPÃƒÂ³lya was one of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made important contributions to a great variety of mathematical research: from complex analysis to mathematical physics, number theory, probability, geometry, astronomy, and combinatorics. He was also an extraordinary teacher--he taught until he was ninety--and maintained a strong interest in pedagogical matters throughout his long career. In addition to How to Solve It, he published a two-volume work on the topic of problem solving, Mathematics of Plausible Reasoning, also with Princeton.\n\nPÃƒÂ³lya is one of the most frequently quoted mathematicians, and the following statements from How to Solve It make clear why: &quot;My method to overcome a difficulty is to go around it.&quot; &quot;Geometry is the science of correct reasoning on incorrect figures.&quot; &quot;In order to solve this differential equation you look at it till a solution occurs to you.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac8f0bfc034e6c0693a741eac85f6e57bf2e2d8","amp;dn":"How+to+Solve+it+-+G.Polya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac8f0bfc034e6c0693a741eac85f6e57bf2e2d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,200,240,191,192,52,230,192,105,58,116,30,172,133,246,229,123,242,226,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
