Can you name the first comedian to hit number one on the pop charts (beating out BOTH Elvis Presley and The Sound of Music?), or to hold number one and two simultaneously, or to have a gold comedy album?\n\nThe answer to all three is Bob Newhart. His comedy stands the test of time. Listen to ABE LINCOLN vs MADISON AVENUE and see if the current political scene does not rush to mind. In the ranks of all time famous standup routines, KING KONG or GRACE L. FERGUSON AIRLINES ranks right up there with CarlinÃƒÂ¢??s SEVEN DIRTY WORDS or PryorÃƒÂ¢??s MUDBONE.\n\nContained in this torrent is the 2001 anthology of his top routines from the 1960s, a live recording from 1995 of his classic routines to a modern audience, and some odd tracks not included in the anthology. I only wish that I could hear all these for the first time as many of you now will.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:713715520e1ed752aed48c1fe679a826f6096612","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Bob+Newhart+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"713715520e1ed752aed48c1fe679a826f6096612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,55,21,82,14,30,215,82,174,212,140,31,230,121,168,38,246,9,102,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
