Mosquito feels nostalgic for when the YYYs were New York's most thrilling underdogs, and not just because one song begins, &quot;I lost you on the subway car/Got caught without my metro card,&quot; and builds a groove on what sounds like the grind of a missed L train. The vibe, shaped partly in New Orleans with longtime crony Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio, is raw, scrappily urban and all over the place. &quot;Under the Earth&quot; channels Eighties avant-funk; &quot;Sacrilege&quot; begins like a love-drunk prayer over Nick Zinner's neon slashing and Brian Chase's rat-trap drums, then gets bum-rushed by a gospel choir, like the trio wandered into a Harlem church revival and got saved. Not everything works: &quot;Buried Alive&quot; is basically a goth-y version of R.E.M.'s &quot;Radio Song.&quot; But the tragic magic blazes on &quot;Despair,&quot; a funereal procession that recalls Joy Division's &quot;Atmosphere&quot; but offers communion beyond the existential wail. Like the best blues singers, O manages to make loneliness not just inclusive but balls-out celebratory.\n\n01 Sacrilege 3:50\n02 Subway 5:16\n03 Mosquito 2:59\n04 Under the Earth 4:18\n05 Slave 4:06\n06 These Paths 5:03\n07 Area 52 2:54\n08 Buried Alive (featuring Dr. Octagon)\t5:16\n09 Always 4:07\n10 Despair 4:48\n11 Wedding Song 4:58\n\nTotal length: 47:35\t\n\nDeluxe edition bonus tracks\t\n\n12 Subway (NOLA demo)\t3:54\n13 Wedding Song (Acoustic)\t2:53\n14 Despair (Acoustic)\t5:00\n15 Mosquito (Live from YYY's Bunker Studio)\t3:24","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9094bc62bee05bf970216f3e6fcc87c287f4fd4","amp;dn":"Yeah+Yeah+Yeahs-+%282013%29+Mosquito+%28Deluxe+Edition%29++Projeto+Chern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9094bc62bee05bf970216f3e6fcc87c287f4fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,9,75,198,43,238,5,191,151,2,22,243,230,252,200,124,40,127,79,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
