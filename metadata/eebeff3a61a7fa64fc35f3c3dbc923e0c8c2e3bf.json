Barbara is the author of The Garden Primer, and Eliot wrote the bible for organic gardening, The New Organic Grower. Today they are the face of the locavore movement, working through their extraordinary Four Season Farm in Maine. And now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written the book on how to grow what you eat, and cook what you grow.\n\nThe Four Season Farm GardenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cookbook is two books in one. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a complete four-season cookbook with 120 recipes from Barbara, a master cook as well as master gardener, who shows how to maximize the fruitsÃ¢â‚¬â€and vegetablesÃ¢â‚¬â€of your labors, from Stuffed Squash Blossom Fritters to Red Thai Curry with Fall Vegetables to Hazelnut Torte with Summer Berries.\n\nAnd itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a step-by-step garden guide that works no matter how big or small your plot, with easy-to-follow instructions and plans for different gardens. It covers size of the garden, nourishing the soil, planning ahead, and the importance of rotating cropsÃ¢â‚¬â€yes, even in your backyard. And, at the core, individual instructions on the crops, from the hardy and healthful cabbage family to fourteen essential culinary herbs.\n\nEating doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get any more local than your own backyard.\n\nThe Four Season Farm Gardener's Cookbook\nBook Language: English \nPages: 496\nFile Type: Pdf, epub, mobi\nFile Size: 113.08 MB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ANiuKc0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ANiuKc0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eebeff3a61a7fa64fc35f3c3dbc923e0c8c2e3bf","amp;dn":"The+Four+Season+Farm+Gardener%27s+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eebeff3a61a7fa64fc35f3c3dbc923e0c8c2e3bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,190,255,58,97,167,250,100,252,53,243,195,219,201,35,224,200,194,227,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
