But when Isaacson, a lifelong horseman, rode their neighbor's horse with Rowan, Rowan improved immeasurably. He was struck with a crazy idea: why not take Rowan to Mongolia, the one place in the world where horses and shamanic healing intersected?\n\nThe Horse Boy is the dramatic and heartwarming story of that impossible adventure. In Mongolia, the family found undreamed of landscapes and people, unbearable setbacks, and advances beyond their wildest dreams. This is a deeply moving, truly one-of-a-kind story--of a family willing to go to the ends of the earth to help their son, and of a boy learning to connect with the world for the first time.\n\nIMDb RATING: 7.5/10 (141 votes)\n\nSource .........: DVD NTSC Retail\nDuration .......: 01:33:58\nVideo Bitrate ..: 893kbps\nResolution .....: 576x320\nFrame Rate .....: 23.976fps\nSound Bitrate ..: 136kbps MP3 English\nSubs ...........: English\n\ncredit NODLABS &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE even the CRITICIZERS :)\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d2cbe00ca77d81208afb1664f90e9f9143b1072","amp;dn":"The.Horse.Boy.2009.LiMiTED.DOCU.DVDRip.XviD-NODLABS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d2cbe00ca77d81208afb1664f90e9f9143b1072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,44,190,0,202,119,216,18,8,175,177,102,79,144,233,249,20,59,16,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
