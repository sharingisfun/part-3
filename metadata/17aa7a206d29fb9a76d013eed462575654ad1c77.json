He's also a psychopath.His main goal is to hide his condition and lead a seemingly normal life in hopes to pay off his debts and become a full-time musician in Austin's club scene. But on one lousy day his carefully-controlled world starts to shatter: he's demoted at work and accused of stealing a fellow musician's song.He also meets a beautiful woman in a lime green dress--perhaps the biggest threat to his safety of all.

But a security guard catches them in the act and simple theft turns into capital murder.Cracks start to show in the conspiracy and, with no allegiance to anyone but himself, Dominic has to decide whether to stick by his partners in crime, or let his true nature come out to play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17aa7a206d29fb9a76d013eed462575654ad1c77","amp;dn":"Mark+Pryor-Hollow+Man++%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17aa7a206d29fb9a76d013eed462575654ad1c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,170,122,32,109,41,251,154,118,208,19,238,212,98,87,86,84,173,28,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
