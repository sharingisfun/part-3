Golden Son continues the stunning saga of Darrow, a rebel forged by tragedy, battling to lead his oppressed people to freedom.\n\nAs a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. DarrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the GoldsÃ¢â‚¬â€and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.\n\nA lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even loveÃ¢â‚¬â€but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retributionÃ¢â‚¬â€and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow EoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s principles of love and justice to free his people.\n\nHe must live for more.\n\nPraise for Golden Son\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Gripping . . . Both author and lead character have cranked up the emotional stakes. . . . With Golden Son, Brown avoids the sophomore slump, charging the novel with the kind of dystopia-toppling action youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect in a trilogy ender, not a middle volume.

Every action seems to flow into the next.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€NPR\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a far superior sequel, in fact: one of the rare breed of reads that improves upon its predecessor in every conceivable category. . . . In a word, Golden Son is stunning. Never mind how little weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen of 2015: Among science fiction fans, it should be a shoo-in for book of the year.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Tor.com\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Pierce Brown is a prodigy.
