On paper, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a wealth of contradictions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a country boy with an exotic accent, a balladeer with rock &amp; roll chops, a stubbled face framed by flat-ironed hair. On his albums, though, Urban molds those would-be incompatibilities into some of the slickest country songs this side of Taylor Swift, appealing to his longtime Nashville supporters while still targeting fans who wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be caught dead inside a honky tonk. Released one year after 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Defying Gravity, Get Closer is another country-pop hybrid, executed with swagger and professionalism by the man who helped bring drum machines to Music City.\n\nGet Closer is the seventh studio album by Australian country music artist Keith Urban.
