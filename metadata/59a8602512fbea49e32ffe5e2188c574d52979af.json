This hardly signals an excursion into electronic music for the folkie, but Barlow does paint Mutineers with many appealingly muted colors, an approach that seems surprisingly bright after the off-white Foundling. At its best, the production is so quietly textured it never draws attention to itself; instead, it enhances the songs themselves, letting them breathe and settle. It's not simply that the production of Mutineers is well-drawn, so are the melodies of the songs. Grey remains a subtle songwriter, but these songs are direct and often slyly hooky, which means Mutineers makes a striking initial impact then seeps in deeply.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a8602512fbea49e32ffe5e2188c574d52979af","amp;dn":"David+Gray+-+Mutineers+%5B2014%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a8602512fbea49e32ffe5e2188c574d52979af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,168,96,37,18,251,234,73,227,47,254,94,33,136,197,116,213,41,121,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
