Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown and J. C. Heard form a solid rhythm section, which provides a fabulous swing machine.\n\nPart cutting contest, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jam SessionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ utilizes blues-based riffs, jazz standards, and ballad medleys to serve not only as jousting platforms between the era's top instrumentalists but also as spotlight features, yielding some of the most memorable, undiluted (all being first takes with no edits), and extended solos in many of these musicians' careers.
