So being extremely frustrated that another Pirater decided to be a douche I shit on his protection and cracked the installer. \n\nHow to INSTALL:\n\nOpen up the main folder that comes in the download and there should be 4 other folders in there called \n\nCaptain_Sim\nEffects\nGauges\nSimObjects\n\n\nJust copy these 4 folders into the MAIN FSX directory and do nothing else, load up FSX and enjoy.\n\n\n\nAnd before anyone bitches at me, I downloaded the torrent originally to fucking use it, and I am using it right now so I KNOW it works, dont comment on here bitching at me that it doesn't work because I know for a fact that it works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da996040aa1e6f8ada2f068c2e4cb3a4b721939","amp;dn":"FSX+Captain+Sim+727+Pro+Pack+2.1+w%2FVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da996040aa1e6f8ada2f068c2e4cb3a4b721939","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,169,150,4,10,161,230,248,173,162,240,104,194,228,203,58,75,114,25,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
