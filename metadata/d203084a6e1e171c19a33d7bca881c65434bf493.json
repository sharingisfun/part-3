He launched a new line of Artisan Wine Breads in 2009 under the brand name Oven Artisans. Cohen created his new breads with a wine grape starter in collaboration with Channing Daughters Vineyard in Long Island. The technique used dates all the way back to ancient Egypt, where bakers who were baking bread in the same facility as wine was being fermented discovered that the natural yeast in the air from the fermenting grapes would leaven the bread and give it special flavor. In 2010, Cohen premiered his beer bread--a chewy, dark-hued creation with a nutty, robust flavor that comes from the Otis Stout from Sixpoint Craft Ales that's mixed into the dough. Orwashers Artisan Bread features the techniques used as well as the recipes for Orwasher's most famous breads adapted specifically to facilitate home baking.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nSince purchasing Orwasher's, the nearly 100 year old Upper East Side New York bakery in 2007, Keith Cohen, formerly of The Tribeca Oven Inc., has maintained his dedication to baking the old world traditional breads like kosher rye and challahs that made the iconic bakery famous while introducing his own line of delicious artisan breads including wine and beer breads. Sourcing many of his ingredients locally and collaborating with other local artisans whenever possible, Cohen, a passionate bread lover, believes in making all of his breads by hand, the old-fashioned way and at the same time he is constantly inspired to keep tinkering with his recipes to bring new flavors to his customers.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction  . . .9\r\nChapter 1 Orwashers Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow  . . .15\r\nChapter 2 Orwashers Bread 101 . . . 25\r\nChapter 3 Ingredients and The Local Movement . . .81\r\nChapter 4 Preferments: Starters, Levains, and Bigas . . .103\r\nChapter 5 The Recipes  . . .115\r\nChapter 6 Artisan Wine and Beer Breads  . . .173\r\nChapter 7 Experimentation and Troubleshooting  . . .197\r\nChapter 8 Orwashers and Artisan Breads Our Latest Challenge  . . .207\r\nGlossary  . . .216\r\nIndex . . .218\r\nAcknowledgments . . .224\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/7vqd0b5c5/Orwashers_Artisan_Bread_100_Years_of_Technique.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d203084a6e1e171c19a33d7bca881c65434bf493","amp;dn":"Orwashers+Artisan+Bread+-+100+Years+of+Techniques+and+Recipes+%28g","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d203084a6e1e171c19a33d7bca881c65434bf493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,3,8,74,110,30,23,28,25,163,61,123,202,136,28,101,67,75,244,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
