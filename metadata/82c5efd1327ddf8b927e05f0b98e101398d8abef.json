Google Chrome also uses a brand new javascript engine (V8), which is much faster than existing javascript interpreters. This means you can create more complex and more intensive AJAX applications with fewer speed and processing constraints. Finally, Google Chrome is built on top of Blink (WebKit fork), so Google Chrome users will benefit from the CSS3 features being added to Blink (WebKit fork) as those features are released","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82c5efd1327ddf8b927e05f0b98e101398d8abef","amp;dn":"Google+Chrome+39.0.2171.71+Stable+%28x86+and+x64%29+%7E%7BB%40tman%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82c5efd1327ddf8b927e05f0b98e101398d8abef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,197,239,209,50,125,223,139,146,126,5,240,185,142,16,19,152,216,171,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
