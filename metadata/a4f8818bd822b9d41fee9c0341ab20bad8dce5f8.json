Rather than a simple presentation of data, first-hand accounts present a vivid picture of the conception and design of each project showing how synthesis is really done and furthering our knowledge of the art of organic synthesis in discovering new reactions, creating new designs and building molecules with atom and step economies that provide solutions through function to create a better world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f8818bd822b9d41fee9c0341ab20bad8dce5f8","amp;dn":"Strategies+and+Tactics+in+Organic+Synthesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f8818bd822b9d41fee9c0341ab20bad8dce5f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,248,129,139,216,34,185,212,31,238,156,3,65,171,32,186,216,220,229,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
