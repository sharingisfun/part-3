A music legend beyond compare, who almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for soul music, Ray Charles proved his mastery with countless jazz, country, R&amp;B, and pop masterpieces, during a career that spanned seven decades.\n\nHis musical genius is celebrated in this 3-CD set, covering his seminal time at Atlantic between 1952 and 1959, as well as some unreleased material only available on the Genius Box Set, and a few classics from RayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own label. As music writer David Ritz said Ã¢â‚¬Å“These are the historic years of his creative explosion, the time when he reinvented himself as a musical revolutionary. These records will live forever.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eba63209f4617e7c6c9025d7a0fe9823e90acd5a","amp;dn":"Ray+Charles+-+King+Of+Cool+The+Genius+of+Ray+Charles+%282014%29+3CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eba63209f4617e7c6c9025d7a0fe9823e90acd5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,166,50,9,244,97,126,124,108,144,37,215,160,254,152,35,233,10,205,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
