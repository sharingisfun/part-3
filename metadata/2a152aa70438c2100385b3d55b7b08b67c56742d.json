You don't just choose an overall sharpening adjustment, but you do it according to the intention of the output. Some programs for enlarging images also use similar types of criteria. This program incorporates special algorithms designed for digital photography. It is geared toward photographers. It offers two types of sharpening, Raw Presharpening and the Output Sharpening. It is designed for Output sharpening; Display (what you see on the screen) is a type of Output. It is very exact as to type of paper, printer dpi, etc. I will go into this in the review. Nik Software advocates either a 1 or 2 step process. They state that most photographers will only use Output Sharpening. They advocate using this method or, for finer results, adding Presharpening to it. If you are starting with Presharpening, which you can only do with camera raw images, you turn off the sharpening in Camera Raw, for example if using Adobe Photoshop, as well as in your digital camera. Then, you and apply a small amount of sharpening to the image after converting the RAW file and after any noise reduction has been applied. The greatest amount of sharpening is applied right before output using specific criteria.\n\nNik plug-ins share a basic uniformity of interface and type of controls. This lessens the learning curve a lot although it doesn't eliminate it when using the different programs. I will be treating each of my reviews on Nik Software plug-ins individually so there probably will be some repetition of features. One of the basic features is U PointÃ‚Â® Technology which relies on Control Points. Using these Control Points, you can determine how much or little you affect the localized area.\n\nInfo:\n\n- Disconnect net.\n- Install.\n- Open PS, select image, go to plugin and register.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/46236944540233682781.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/46236944540233682781.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/52851310421345178433.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/52851310421345178433.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a152aa70438c2100385b3d55b7b08b67c56742d","amp;dn":"Nik+Software+-+Sharpener+Pro+3.005+%5BENG%5D%5BSerial%5D%5BPhotoshop+Plugi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a152aa70438c2100385b3d55b7b08b67c56742d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,21,42,167,4,56,194,16,3,133,179,213,91,123,8,182,124,86,116,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
