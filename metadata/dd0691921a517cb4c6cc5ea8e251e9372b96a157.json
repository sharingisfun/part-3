These presentations can be difficult to manage and often pose significant challenges. A better understanding of most common psychiatric problems can greatly aid both providers and patients. Emergency Psychiatry reviews a wide range of common psychiatric disorders and provides succinct management guidelines. Written by emergency physicians and psychiatrists, Emergency Psychiatry is a rapid reference for the acute management of psychiatric disorders for all care providers, including, but not limited to, emergency physicians, internists, psychiatrists, social workers, family practitioners and other primary care providers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd0691921a517cb4c6cc5ea8e251e9372b96a157","amp;dn":"Emergency+Psychiatry-+Cambridge%2C+2013+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd0691921a517cb4c6cc5ea8e251e9372b96a157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,6,145,146,26,81,124,180,198,204,94,168,226,81,233,55,43,150,161,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
