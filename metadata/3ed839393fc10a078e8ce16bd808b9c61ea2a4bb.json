It was produced by T Bone Burnett and includes a collaboration with the Indigo Girls on &quot;Cannonball.&quot; The album was recorded in an eleven-day-long session with Carlile, the twins (Tim and Phil Hanseroth), cellist Josh Neumann and drummer Matt Chamberlain to capture the sound of Carlile&amp;#039;s live performances. The crack in Carlile&amp;#039;s vocals during the title track, &quot;The Story&quot;, came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded. Carlile herself describes the vocals as &quot;technically wrong but emotionally right.&quot;[8] She would also contribute vocals to &quot;Last Tears&quot; from Indigo Girls&amp;#039; Despite Our Differences.\n\nCarlile was exposed to a wider audience when ABC&amp;#039;s Grey&amp;#039;s Anatomy showcased three of her songs: &quot;Tragedy,&quot; &quot;What Can I Say,&quot; and &quot;Throw It All Away&quot;. In April 2007, Grey&amp;#039;s Anatomy debuted a version of the video for the single The Story interspersed with footage from the show. On May 3, 2007, a special two-hour episode of &quot;Grey&amp;#039;s Anatomy&quot; featured Carlile&amp;#039;s song &quot;Turpentine&quot; during footage of the &quot;Grey&amp;#039;s Anatomy&quot; spin-off, Private Practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ed839393fc10a078e8ce16bd808b9c61ea2a4bb","amp;dn":"Brandi+Carlile+-+The+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ed839393fc10a078e8ce16bd808b9c61ea2a4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,216,57,57,63,193,10,7,142,140,225,107,216,8,185,198,30,162,164,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
