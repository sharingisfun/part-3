The DEA busts one of the major players by the name of &quot;Memo&quot; Lucero and imprison him in the United States but then a major player named Diablo then takes over the business and now he is now the major player targeted by Vetter and his team. But when Vetter&amp;#x27;s wife is killed in a botched hit organized by Diablo, he seeks revenge against those responsible and in the process has to seek help from the imprisoned Lucero in order to catch Diablo. But in the process, Vetter and Hicks have to fight their way up the chain to get to Diablo but it&amp;#x27;s easier said than done when all Vetter can focus on is revenge...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db2e7045e2526f30d439df4417d63a50c261a9a9","amp;dn":"A+Man+Apart+%282003%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db2e7045e2526f30d439df4417d63a50c261a9a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,46,112,69,226,82,111,48,212,57,223,68,23,214,58,80,194,97,169,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
