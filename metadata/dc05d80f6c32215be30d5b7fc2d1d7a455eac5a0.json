After setting off on a ridiculously convoluted scheme to generate material for his new book (by undermining the state's capital punishment policy), he soon comes to realize that fate, she is fickle, and justice, she is blind.\n\nReview (All Movie Guide)\n--\nCompared to Fritz Lang's German films, and most of his American ones as well, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is surprisingly dull visually. Constricted by a tight budget, Lang was forced to sacrifice his penchant for richly detailed visual designs and satisfy himself with making a competent suspense picture hampered only by some wooden acting, particularly on the part of lead Dana Andrews. Despite its lack of dazzle, the film is still filled with signature Langian moments. The plot hinges on one of his most vicious twists of fate, and although a final plot twist requires a suspension of disbelief of near-heroic proportions, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt remains compelling right up to the end. -- Tom Vick\n\nRip Specs\n\nFile Name .............: BeyondAReasonableDoubt.TVRip.XviD.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 734,027,776 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 01:20:10 (115332 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 576x432 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nFPS ...................: 23.976 FPS\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1136 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.190 bpp\nB-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 80 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR audio\nInterleave ............: 83 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\nSubtitles .............: English Captions\n\nSource ...............: Digital Cable --&gt; DVR --&gt; XviD (IVTC'd)\nRipped by .............: rentboy\n\nScreens\n\n[img]http://i267.photobucket.com/albums/ii297/vicenteribeiro/beyond2.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i267.photobucket.com/albums/ii297/vicenteribeiro/beyond1.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i267.photobucket.com/albums/ii297/vicenteribeiro/beyond3.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://i267.photobucket.com/albums/ii297/vicenteribeiro/beyond4.jpg[/img]\n\nnot my rip.\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
