The Best Band I Ever Had\n24 bit 88.2 KHz SACD rip\n\nAlthough the title of this reissue is not necessarily accurate (Buddy Rich's 1966 big band was a stronger unit), this is a high-quality jazz album. Rich surprisingly does not solo much (just on Chick Corea's &quot;Fiesta&quot;) but the material is strong, the arrangements (by Mike Abene, Frank Perowsky, Tom Boros, Barry Keiner and Barry Mintzer) are colorful, and the soloists are excellent. The 15-piece Buddy Rich big band features Steve Marcus on tenor and soprano, Gary Pribek on tenor, pianist Barry Keiner and trumpeter Dean Pratt and the songs include inventive versions of &quot;Birdland,&quot; &quot;Bouncin' with Bud&quot; and Horace Silver's &quot;Cape Verdean Blues.&quot; The only weak point to this set is that the playing time is only around 40 minutes since this is a straight reissue of a former LP. Recommended. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Birdland\n02. Bouncin' With Bud\n03. Cape Verdean Blues\n04. Fiesta\n05. Funk City Ola\n\nEnjoy and share!
