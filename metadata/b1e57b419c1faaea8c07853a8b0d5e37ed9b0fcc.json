But this year, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to do something about it. Disguising himself as Santa, he sneaks down into the town to take everything Christmassy, and everything else, from them. But will that stop Christmas from coming? Is he beyond enjoying the season himself?\n\nThis is one of the best Christmas presents you can give yourself. Adapted from the children's book by Dr Seuss, this charming story is one to watch every holiday season. It is just edgy enough to help you forget the more cloying aspects of Christmas. It is also sweet enough to remind you of the reason for all that holiday cheer. Animation genius Chuck Jones directed this 1966 television production featuring the voice of Boris Karloff as the mean greenie. Bitter and selfish, the Grinch decides to steal Christmas away from the Whos, sweet little folk at the bottom of his mountain that is his home. When little Cindy Loo Who returns his hateful act with kindness, she melts the old miser's heart. There are many reasons to watch this: inventive wordplay, Karloff's impressive narration and a very memorable soundtrack.\n\nA enjoyable classic for kids as well as adults alike. \n\nRuntime: 26 mins\nLanguage: English\nYear: 1966\nQuality: 9/10\nFormat: avi format \n\nSee reviews here,  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Seuss-How-Grinch-Stole-Christmas/dp/B00005QX9Y&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Seuss-How-Grinch-Stole-Christmas/dp/B00005QX9Y&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI would ask every Christian to do 2 things.\n\n1. If possible please buy this movie. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films. Many Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available. \nThat's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic isn't it?\nPlease buy the movies to keep Christian films in business. And please do pray for the Christian movie makers and their families.\n\n2. Please seed the movies for as long as possible. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families. Remember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell. \n\nPS: If you need any specific Christian movie or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5e37303a373f303d362c372d2a373f306c6e6e671e273f363131703d31703730&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nKindly mention the subject as Christian Movies or something similar. \n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! He has done all he could. Tell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1e57b419c1faaea8c07853a8b0d5e37ed9b0fcc","amp;dn":"How+the+Grinch+Stole+Christmas+%28Ultimate+Christmas+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1e57b419c1faaea8c07853a8b0d5e37ed9b0fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,229,123,65,156,31,170,234,140,7,133,58,139,13,94,55,237,155,15,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
