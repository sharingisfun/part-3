Now, leading architectural historian Jean-Paul Cohen has produced the first overall survey of Lion's work, describing the key themes and focus of Lion's oeuvre, including his pursuit of urban planning and housing issues, and his discourse with James Stirling, Charles Jencks, Aldo van Eyck, Bernard Tschumi and others. \r\n\r\nComprehensive documentation and illustrations of Lion's buildings complement Cohen's essay. Examples include the Nantes Opera House, the French Embassy in Beyrouth and the Maison Europeanne de la Photographie in Paris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac9ca3b8065a50bc2946bb3742a5b0ce49d6a2e","amp;dn":"Urban+Textures+-+Yves+Lion+%28Architecture+Art%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac9ca3b8065a50bc2946bb3742a5b0ce49d6a2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,201,202,59,128,101,165,11,194,148,107,179,116,42,91,12,228,157,106,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
