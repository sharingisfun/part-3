His buddy Dugan (James Earl Jones), who just happens to be a cop, offers to take Lucas to the nearest bank so he can start his new life with a brand-spanking new bank account. Naturally they joke about how funny it would be if Lucas went straight back to his old tricks. However the joke's on them when the bank is suddenly held-up by a desperate dim-wit called Ned (Martin Short). To make matters worse, Ned chooses to take Lucas as his hostage, leaving Dugan, and indeed the entire police force, to ponder whether or not Lucas and Ned have actually planned this robbery together. Surely Lucas wouldn't be that stupid... would he?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b070c621f78bafd4258071ef6272780bbe7e924b","amp;dn":"Three+Fugitives+%281989%29+Nick+Nolte+Martin+Short+James+Earl+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b070c621f78bafd4258071ef6272780bbe7e924b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,112,198,33,247,139,175,212,37,128,113,239,98,114,120,11,190,126,146,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
