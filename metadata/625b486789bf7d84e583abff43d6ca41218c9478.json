However, traditional heart disease protocols--with their emphasis on lowering cholesterol--have it all wrong. Emerging science is showing that cholesterol levels are a poor predictor of heart disease and that standard prescriptions for lowering it, such as ineffective low-fat/high-carb diets and serious, side-effect-causing statin drugs, obscure the real causes of heart disease. Even doctors at leading institutions have been misled for years based on creative reporting of research results from pharmaceutical companies intent on supporting the $31-billion-a-year cholesterol-lowering drug industry.\n\nThe Great Cholesterol Myth reveals the real culprits of heart disease, including:\n\n- Inflammation\n\n- Fibrinogen\n\n- Triglycerides\n\n- Homocysteine\n\n- Belly fat\n\n- Triglyceride to HCL ratios\n\n- High glycemic levels\n\nBestselling health authors Jonny Bowden, Ph.D., and Stephen Sinatra, M.D. give readers a 4-part strategy based on the latest studies and clinical findings for effectively preventing, managing, and reversing heart disease, focusing on diet, exercise, supplements, and stress and anger management.\n\nGet proven, evidence-based strategies from the experts with The Great Cholesterol Myth.\n\nMYTHS VS. FACTS\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œHigh cholesterol is the cause of heart disease.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œCholesterol is only a minor player in the cascade of inflammation which is a cause of heart disease.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œHigh cholesterol is a predictor of heart attack.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œThere is no correlation between cholesterol and heart attack.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œLowering cholesterol with statin drugs will prolong your life.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œThere is no data to show that statins have a significant impact on longevity.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œStatin drugs are safe.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œStatin drugs can be extremely toxic including causing death.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œStatin drugs are useful in men, women and the elderly.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œStatin drugs do the best job in middle-aged men with coronary disease.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œStatin drugs are useful in middle-aged men with coronary artery disease because of its impact on cholesterol.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œStatin drugs reduce inflammation and improve blood viscosity (thinning blood). Statins are extremely helpful in men with low HDL and coronary artery disease.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œSaturated fat is dangerous.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œSaturated fats are not dangerous. The killer fats are the transfats from partially hydrogenated oils.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œThe higher the cholesterol, the shorter the lifespan.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œHigher cholesterol protects you from gastrointestinal disease, pulmonary disease and hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œA high carbohydrate diet protects you from heart disease.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œSimple processed carbs and sugars predispose you to heart disease.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œFat is bad for your health.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œMonounsaturated and saturated fats protect you from metabolic syndrome. Sugar is the foe in cardiovascular disease.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œThere is good (HDL) cholesterol and bad (LDL) cholesterol.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œThis is over-simplistic. You must fractionate LDL and HDL to assess the components.\n\nMythÃ¢â‚¬â€œCholesterol causes heart disease.\nFactÃ¢â‚¬â€œCholesterol is only a theory in heart disease and only the small component of LP(a) or Ã¢â‚¬Å“bb shotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ LDL predisposes one to oxidation and inflammation.\n\nThe Great Cholesterol Myth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 1, 2012\nBook Language: English \nPages: 414\nFile Type: Epub, Pdf, Mobi\nFile Size: 4.09 MB\n\nISBN-10: 1592335217\nISBN-13: 978-1592335213","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:625b486789bf7d84e583abff43d6ca41218c9478","amp;dn":"The+Great+Cholesterth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"625b486789bf7d84e583abff43d6ca41218c9478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,91,72,103,137,191,125,132,229,131,171,255,67,214,202,65,33,140,148,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
