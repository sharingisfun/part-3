Entire chapters are devoted to the Papal Palace of Avignon and the splendor of Gothic glass painting. This volume provides an overview of the artistic diversity of the Gothic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in no small part through the richness of the illustrations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that could scarcely be more vivid.\nFor this work, editor Rolf Toman gathered a team of eleven renowned authors with profound expertise in the fields of architecture and art history whose competent knowledge clearly elucidates the art of the Gothic period.\n\nHighlights\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The history of Gothic architecture from its origins and blossoming in 12th-century France through its dis- semination in all of Europe\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In-depth discussion of the most diverse art forms, in-cluding painting, sculpture, metalwork, and book illumination\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Individual essays on special themes such as heresy or the Cathars, the development of cities or the Papal Palace in Avignon\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Richly illustrated with photographs, most of which were taken specifically for this book\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img266/1766/rolftoman.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img266/1766/rolftoman.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nOriginally, Rolf Toman wanted to become a teacher but he spent the years following his second state exam working as a publishing editor at a large international publishing house.
