These songs were recorded in sessions spanning from 1984&amp;#039;s Couldn&amp;#039;t Stand the Weather to 1989&amp;#039;s In Step and were left off of the LPs for whatever reason (or, in the case of Soul to Soul&amp;#039;s &quot;Empty Arms,&quot; a different version was used). What makes the record work is its eclectic diversity -- Vaughan plays slide guitar on &quot;Boot Hill&quot; and acoustic on &quot;Life by the Drop&quot;; he smokes on the slow blues of &quot;May I Have a Talk With You&quot; and the title track just as much as on the up-tempo Lonnie Mack cover, &quot;Wham&quot;; and he shows the jazzy side of his playing on Hendrix&amp;#039;s &quot;Little Wing&quot; and Kenny Burrell&amp;#039;s &quot;Chitlins Con Carne.&quot; But it&amp;#039;s not just musical diversity that makes the record work, it&amp;#039;s also Vaughan&amp;#039;s emotional range. From the morbidly dark &quot;Boot Hill&quot; to the lilting &quot;Little Wing&quot; to the exuberant tributes to his influences -- Lonnie Mack on &quot;Wham&quot; and Albert King on &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot; -- Vaughan makes the material resonate, and in light of his death, &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot; and the touching survivor-story ballad &quot;Life by the Drop&quot; are two of the most moving moments in Vaughan&amp;#039;s oeuvre.\n\nAll Music: http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:apfrxql5ld6e\n\nSample: http://media.putfile.com/07---Close-To-You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35529f6799aba9d8188d046fa89ff94f6682dd35","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+and+Double+Trouble+-+The+Sky+Is+Crying","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35529f6799aba9d8188d046fa89ff94f6682dd35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,82,159,103,153,171,169,216,24,141,4,111,168,159,249,79,102,130,221,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
