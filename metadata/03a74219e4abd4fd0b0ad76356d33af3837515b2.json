(Slaves in the Deep South didn't speak Italian, neither did their masters.)\n\nThis is the true version of Goodbye Uncle Tom, the one that disgusted the film critic Pauline Kael.  So you know it's worthwhile and good.  Enjoy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03a74219e4abd4fd0b0ad76356d33af3837515b2","amp;dn":"Goodbye+Uncle+Tom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03a74219e4abd4fd0b0ad76356d33af3837515b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,167,66,25,228,171,212,253,11,10,215,99,86,211,58,243,131,117,21,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
