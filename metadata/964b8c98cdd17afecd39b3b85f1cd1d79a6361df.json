In this explosive two-volume video production boxing and grappling expert Mark Hatmaker throws away the rulebook and turns back the clock to reveal the forbidden techniques of extreme boxing. Hatmaker begins with the basics of stance and movement, including little-known tricks to improve your defenses against grapplers and kickboxers. He then teaches you the extreme boxing arsenal - a collection of savage punches, head-butts, elbows and stomps that will enable you to devastate even the toughest opponent. To develop an airtight defense, Hatmaker shows you how to slip, bob, weave, cuff and cover, as well as foolproof methods of defending against the shoot. Finally, you'll learn how to put it all together with punching combinations and drills that will prepare you for anything thrown at you in the ring or on the street. Learn why the only boxing worth betting your life on is Extreme Boxing.
