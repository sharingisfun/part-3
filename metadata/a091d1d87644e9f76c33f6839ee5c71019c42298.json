Rob Papen himself called it Ã¢â‚¬ËœCross-fusion synthesisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ since it covered so much musical ground so effectively.\n \nToday BLUE-II remains true to that ethos with even more sound dimensions and features to its extended name, starting with six oscillators beating at its musically creative heart. These can be connected in various ways, together with two analogue-style modelled stereo filters with 27 different filter types, an enormous range of processing and modulation options, sequencer, and an incredibly powerful arpeggiator. A new range of specially selected waveforms based on samples have been meticulously fashioned for creating new and fresh-sounding synth sounds, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go expecting acoustic pianos galore here. However, since choirs and strings are an excellent basis for so many synth sounds BLUE-II has them in abundance Ã¢â‚¬â€ with much more besides!\n \nMoreover, BLUE-II takes the useful XY pad features from its popular virtual instrument sibling Blade Ã¢â‚¬â€ a cutting-edge additive synthesis powerhouse with a human touch Ã¢â‚¬â€ and transplants them into its own equally extraordinary workflowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ perfect for time-based sound movements and vector pad-type sounds. Complemented by four top-quality FX processors, each offering 35 FX types, BLUE-II is a phenomenally powerful virtual instrument to behold.\n \nBut BLUE-II is also easy to use, thanks to its user-friendly user interface and an innovative Easy Edit page for speedy sound changes, while the Bank Manager allows whistle-stop navigation through thousands of inspirational Rob Papen presets and artist sound banks covering a wide range of musical styles.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo the right thing and support good devs!\nC0PYL3FT3R a.k.a. 23K! - 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthepiratebay.se - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (06).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a091d1d87644e9f76c33f6839ee5c71019c42298","amp;dn":"Rob+Papen+-+Blue+II+v1.0.0e+-+OS+X+%5BC0PYL3FT3R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a091d1d87644e9f76c33f6839ee5c71019c42298","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,145,209,216,118,68,233,247,108,51,246,131,158,229,199,16,25,196,34,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
