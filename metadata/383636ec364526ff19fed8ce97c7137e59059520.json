Of course, the sooner mistakes are caught, the less costly they become. Based on the authorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ combined experience working on projects large and small, Construction Management: Subcontractor Scopes of Work delineates how project teams can avoid mistakes and run projects more intelligently, effectively, and efficiently.\n\nThis bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concentration on the nuts and bolts of a construction project, rather than on basic philosophies and concepts, sets it apart. It focuses not on the mechanics of writing subcontract scopes of work, but on why they are written the way they are. Designed by contractors for contractors, this is not a book of simple checklists describing how to address various issues, but a compilation of practical examples and lessons learned to form a knowledge base that can be applied to any project. This knowledge can be used to prepare bid documents that clearly define the roles of the various subcontractors, ensuring the full scope of the project is covered without redundancy or duplication.\n\nProvides invaluable training while minimizing lost productivity!\n\nAuxiliary multiple choice tests and answer keys are available for download from the CRC website. Using this feature, executives will spend less time preparing and presenting in-house seminars, employees can study when they want and take the tests at opportune times. With this book and downloadable tests, the productivity lost due to training is reduced tremendously.\n\nDisagreements over the scope of work required of a general contractor and/or trade subcontractors that ultimately end in construction disputes plague the construction industry. This book elucidates problematic aspects of construction projects while also providing insight into the different perspectives of the various project team members. It delivers helpful information that prevents gaps in subcontract coverage and scope disagreements and reduces potential construction disputes.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 464 pages\n# Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (November 18, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1439809410\n# ISBN-13: 978-1439809419","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383636ec364526ff19fed8ce97c7137e59059520","amp;dn":"Construction+Management%3ASubcontractor+Scopes+of+Work%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383636ec364526ff19fed8ce97c7137e59059520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,54,54,236,54,69,38,255,25,254,216,206,151,199,19,126,89,5,149,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
