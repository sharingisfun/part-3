And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content with his quiet and peaceful existence.  \n\nThat is, until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve: far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to Ã¢â‚¬Å“foldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ dimensions, it shrinks distances so that a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step.\n\nThe invention promises to make mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the Door is completely safe.\n\nYet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite what it seemsÃ¢â‚¬â€and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret.  \n\nAs his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one answer that makes sense. And if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, it may only be a matter of time before the project destroysÃ¢â‚¬Â¦everything.  \n\nA cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never see coming, The Fold is that rarest of things: a genuinely page-turning science-fiction thriller. Step inside its pages and learn why author Peter Clines has already won legions of loyal fans. \n\n\nRead by Ray Porter\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde978d56b369321ae128b179a3033e21cebc542","amp;dn":"Peter+Clines+-+The+Fold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde978d56b369321ae128b179a3033e21cebc542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,233,120,213,107,54,147,33,174,18,139,23,154,48,51,226,28,235,197,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
