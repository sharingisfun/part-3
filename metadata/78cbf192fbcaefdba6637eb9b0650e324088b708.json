What is x264? \n\n\nx264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!\n\n02. What is a .mkv file? \n\n\nMKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard Audio/Video container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78cbf192fbcaefdba6637eb9b0650e324088b708","amp;dn":"Breaking+Bad+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3+Complete+-+x264+-+MKV+by+RiddlerA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78cbf192fbcaefdba6637eb9b0650e324088b708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,203,241,146,251,202,239,219,166,99,126,185,176,101,14,50,64,136,183,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
