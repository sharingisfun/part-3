What should you cook when a date is coming over for dinner? How do you buy a used car and not get totally taken for a ride? How do you stop a charging dog?\n\nIn Man Up!, journalist Paul OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Donnell and his team of knowledgable experts tackle 367 of these tough questions, imparting their advice in short to-the-point answers. Organized thematically, Man Up! is packed with essential advice delivered in prose that is as entertaining to read as it is helpful and clever. The tips run the gamutÃ¢â‚¬â€from how to mix up a killer punch for a party to how to throw a punch when there is no other way out. Hip, engaging line drawings help to illustrate the advice, providing more than just sight gags. For every young man newly embarking on his independent adult life and for a guy at any age wanting to brush up on his skills, Man Up! is like having a trusted friend helping you along the wayÃ¢â‚¬â€except this friend has all the right answers!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fed3a9dbd800dc7a2c8cb5da38608b04a991a5a8","amp;dn":"Man+Up%21%3A+367+Classic+Skills+for+the+Modern+Guy+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fed3a9dbd800dc7a2c8cb5da38608b04a991a5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,211,169,219,216,0,220,122,44,140,181,218,56,96,139,4,169,145,165,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
