Philosophical argument is closely paralleled with hand-to-hand combat. And all of todayâ€™s Asian martial arts were developed to embody and apply philosophical ideas. In his interview with Bodidharma, Graham Priest brings out aspects of Buddhist philosophy behind Shaolin Kung-Fu â€” how fighting monks are seeking Buddhahood, not brawls. But as Scott Farrellâ€™s chapter reveals, Eastern martial arts have no monopoly on philosophical traditions: Western chivalry is an education in and living revival of Aristotelian ethical theories. Several chapters look at ethical problems raised by the fighting arts. How can the sweaty and brutal be exquisitely beautiful? Every chapter is easily understandable by readers new to martial arts or new to philosophy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b076cbc2d49f4786c9f8dab8946fc76eded9985d","amp;dn":"Martial+Arts+and+Philosophy+%282010%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b076cbc2d49f4786c9f8dab8946fc76eded9985d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,118,203,194,212,159,71,134,201,248,218,184,148,111,199,110,222,217,152,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
