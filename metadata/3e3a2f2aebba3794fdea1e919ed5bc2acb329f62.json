With the spare instrumentation there is an absence\nthat is more felt than heard. I write this not to scare you off, but rather to\npique your interests. This is a beautifully recorded album -- where the\nguitarists faint breathing almost serves as accompaniment -- that asks the\nlistener to use their imagination to fill in what is not there.\n\nSilent Movies is quite different than some of the previous solo guitar efforts\nby Brooklyn based guitarist Marc Ribot. Whereas Exercises in Futility (2008) was\na mind boggling array of acoustic bursts and Saints (2001) was eclectic and\nexploring, the songs here primarily feature a classical acoustic guitar with\nsome instances of electronic soundscapes and loops by Keefus Ciancia. The songs\nare a rather ruminative blend of classical and folk styles, often employing\nrepetitive rhythmic motifs in the lower register, with a layer of simple,\nspacious and effective melodies above. In fact, the opening tune uses even less;\nVariation 1 is a starkly played long form melody with some unexpected intervals,\nwhispering electronics and reserved harmonic shadings. RibotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classical roots\nstart peeking through on Delancey Waltz in which the haunting melody rides over\na rich syncopated bass pattern inviting the listeners to add their own images to\nthe soundtrack.\n\nNatalia in E-Flat Major introduces the only use of an electric guitar on the\nalbum. Utilizing a buzzing, sharp tone, Ribot creates a lullaby fit for a metal\neating bird, then effortlessly segues into a plaintive melody. Most songs have a\ndeliberate pacing, though Fat Man Blues, a mid-tempo bluesy-romp, serves to\nlighten things up a bit towards the albums middle. A version of Batteau starts\nsparsely but soon builds climatically with a spirited improvisation.\n\nThe austerity of the album is its strength but it also can make it a bit\ndaunting. While this is not challenging album to listen to, it is one that\nchallenges you to listen deeply. These tunes, with their insistent chord\npatterns and simple spare melodies, will pull you in with their siren\ncall. Recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e3a2f2aebba3794fdea1e919ed5bc2acb329f62","amp;dn":"Marc+Ribot+-+Silent+Movies+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e3a2f2aebba3794fdea1e919ed5bc2acb329f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,58,47,42,235,186,55,148,253,234,30,145,158,213,188,42,203,50,159,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
