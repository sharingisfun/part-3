Jan Strnad, of course, is one of them.\n\nDen has an extensive and well-written Wiki page that can tell you all you need to know about this character if you're not already familiar with him. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den_%28comics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Den_%28comics%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCaveat: You either like Richard Corben's art, or you don't. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, it doesn't scan very well (and that's nearly every scan of every Corben book I've ever seen digitized). The first half of Den 1 looks particularly rough, so if this is your first experience with Den, don't give up until you've reached page 60 or so.\n\nAnyway, here's approximately 730 pages of Richard Corben's Den. Hope you enjoy.
