Daniel is a kind man and a loving father to his three kids Lydia, Chris, and Natalie, but Daniel&amp;#039;s wife Miranda sees him as a poor disciplinarian, and a bad role model. After Daniel throws an elaborate and disastrous birthday party for Chris, Miranda reaches the end of her limited patience, and files for a divorce. Daniel is heartbroken when Miranda is given custody of the kids and he&amp;#039;s only allowed to visit them once a week. Determined to stay in contact with his kids, Daniel discovers that Miranda is looking for a housekeeper, and with help from his brother Frank, a makeup artist, Daniel gets the job, disguised as Mrs. Iphegenia Doubtfire, a Scottish nanny. Daniel pulls off the ruse so well that neither Miranda nor his children recognize him, and in the process, he learns some parenting tips. Daniel also has to deal with Miranda&amp;#039;s new boyfriend, a jerk named Stu Dunmeyer. \n\nCAST\n\nRobin Williams \t- Daniel Hillard / Mrs. Iphegenia Doubtfire\nSally Field \t- Miranda Hillard\nPierce Brosnan \t- Stu\nHarvey Fierstein \t- Frank\nPolly Holliday \t- Gloria\nLisa Jakub \t- Lydia Hillard\nMatthew Lawrence \t- Chris Hillard\nMara Wilson \t- Natalie Hillard\nRobert Prosky \t- Mr. Lundy\nAnne Haney \t- Mrs. Sellner\nScott Capurro \t- Jack\nScott Beach \t- Judge\nJoe Bellan \t- TV Boss\nAdam Bryant \t- Man in Men&amp;#039;s Room\nJames Cranna \t- Ron\nJames Cunningham \t- Male Employee\nDr. Toad \t- Bartender\nEva Gholson \t- Employee\nPaul Guilfoyle \t- Head Chef\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd0205966b032dcdb4adc7cd437da37097e5b5b7","amp;dn":"Mrs.Doubtfire.1993.DVDRip.XviD.AR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd0205966b032dcdb4adc7cd437da37097e5b5b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,2,5,150,107,3,45,205,180,173,199,205,67,125,163,112,151,229,181,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
