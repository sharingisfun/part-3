It is a revised and enlarged version of\nhis 1977 book entitled &quot;Fractals : form, chance and dimension&quot;.\n===================================================================================\n\nThis rip of the book is in .pdf format. Larger, and more bloated, but more supported by e-book readers.\n\nYou can find the 7MiB book in .djvu format at one of these links: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6075934/Benoit_Mandelbrot_-_The_Fractal_Geometry_of_Nature&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6075934/Benoit_Mandelbrot_-_The_Fractal_Geometry_of_Nature&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy review of the book? Trippy stuff! You really can't use this book as your only source of learning material for fractals. I recommend http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/ for learning, or another book on fractals, like http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4714221/Fractal_Geometry__Mathematical_Foundations_and_Applications\n\n\nMy advice is to ignore most of the math lingo (there isn't a full explanation of some symbols or topics, they're just thrown in there, when you really need a more formal education on them to understand them). Look at the pictures, and get hyped up about order and chaos and attractors and inversions and systems and dimensions and shit! THEN look at follow up material, if you're interested in math.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93a0d5b5ebeadff3c81435c973ba7668788f445","amp;dn":"Benoit+Mandelbrot+-+The+Fractal+Geometry+of+Nature+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f93a0d5b5ebeadff3c81435c973ba7668788f445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,58,13,91,94,190,173,255,60,129,67,92,151,59,167,102,135,136,244,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
