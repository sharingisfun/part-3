It will also help students to integrate their design thinking with appropriate structural and environmental solutions.\n\nThe book explains the relationships between physical phenomena, materials, building elements, and structural types using simple classification systems and real world examples. In addition, it explores current computer techniques for assisting students to predict the structural and environmental behavior of buildings. It also uses historical precedents to explain how the success of a technology is directly related to its cultural context. This second edition includes new sections on environmental design, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and two new case studies.\n\nWritten by three experienced teachers, this book will be invaluable for those contemplating the study of architecture and for those already embarked on such a course","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aacf17ec23e6e777a62ada8edec496fb1fe4649","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Architectural+Technology%2C+2E+Silver+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aacf17ec23e6e777a62ada8edec496fb1fe4649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,172,241,126,194,62,110,119,122,98,173,168,237,236,73,111,177,254,70,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
