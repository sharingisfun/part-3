Released in 2001, it was Bungie West\\\\\\'s only game. It broke new ground by blending third-person shooting with hand-to-hand combat, resulting in a unique, yet familiar game for third-person shooter enthusiasts. In 1999, while still in development, Oni won the Game Critics Awards for Best Action/Adventure Game.\n\nThe game\\\\\\'s universe is heavily influenced by Mamoru Oshii\\\\\\'s anime film Ghost in the Shell.[2] The main characters Konoko and Commander Griffin look similar to the film\\\\\\'s protagonists Motoko Kusanagi and Daisuke Aramaki. Dark Horse Comics published a comic-book version of Oni as a four-issue limited series, the first issue of which was bundled with the Windows version of the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f3a7c51757f2948f2ef4bcbcdaec1a2d124c890","amp;dn":"Oni+Game+%28english%29+and+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f3a7c51757f2948f2ef4bcbcdaec1a2d124c890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,58,124,81,117,127,41,72,242,239,75,203,205,174,193,162,209,36,200,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
