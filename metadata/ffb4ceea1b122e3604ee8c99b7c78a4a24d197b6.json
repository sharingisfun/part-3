But it isn't just the money he is interested in. Morrie is obsessed with the author's notebooks and is prepared to kill the author for them.\r\n2009: Meet young Pete Saubers, whose father was knocked down by an out-of-control Mercedes in a job line-up. When he discovers a buried trunk of money and notebooks of a famous writer, he has the means to rescue his family from poverty. If he can keep it secret.\r\n2013: Morrie is up for parole. And he's hell-bent on recovering the notebooks.\r\nThat's when retired detective Bill Hodges - who has set up a company called Finders Keepers - discovers the scheme.\r\nFinders Keepers is spectacular suspense. It is also King writing about how literature shapes a life - for good, for bad, for ever. \r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\nStephen Edwin King is of Scot-Irish ancestry, was born in Portland, Maine in 1947.

Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these were later gathered into the Night Shift collection.\r\nIn the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes at Hampden Academy. Then, in the spring of 1973, his novel Carrie was accepted for publication. This was followed by 'Salem's Lot. The following year, the Kings left Maine for Boulder, Colorado, where Stephen wrote The Shining. Returning to a home in the Lakes Region of western Maine, Stephen finished The Stand and The Dead Zone.\r\nIn 1977, the Kings spent three months in England. He and his wife now spend winters in Florida, and the remainder of the year in their Bangor and Lovell homes in Maine. Stephen King has written more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers. His acclaimed novels and short story collections include Carrie, The Shining, The Stand, Misery and 11.22.63.
