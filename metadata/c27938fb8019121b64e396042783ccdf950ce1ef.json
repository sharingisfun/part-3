Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea. The game has ominous secret societies competing with each other to control the world through sinister means, including legal, illegal, and even mystical. It was designed as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek rather than serious&quot; take on conspiracy theories. It contains groups named similarly to real world organizations, such as the Society for Creative Anachronism. It can be played by two to eight players. Depending on the number of players, a game can take between one and six hours.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cuttingedge.org/articles/icg.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cuttingedge.org/articles/icg.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c27938fb8019121b64e396042783ccdf950ce1ef","amp;dn":"Illuminati+Card+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c27938fb8019121b64e396042783ccdf950ce1ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,121,56,251,128,25,18,27,100,227,150,4,39,131,204,223,149,12,225,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
