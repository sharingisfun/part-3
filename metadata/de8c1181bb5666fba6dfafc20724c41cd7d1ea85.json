This is one of the least well know Coltrane albums, partly because it is an all blues format and partly because it was released at the end of his association with Atlantic records.\n \nPlays The Blues features the talents of McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones and Steve Davis. It is the beginning of his work with Tyner and Jones in quartet form. For that alone this recording would be important. \n\nAlthough this album is called Plays The Blues, this is by no means the only blues which Coltrane plays. There are blues elements, moods and feelings in all of his best-known recordings. Listen to &quot;Slowtrane,&quot; &quot;Blue Train,&quot; &quot;Bessie's Blues&quot; among others and one can't help but hear the blues vibe. \n\nThe music is fantastic and all tracks have that same blues vibe. They hit the listener right in the heart and soul and don't let go. All are superb, but &quot;Blues To Bechet,&quot; &quot;Mr. Day,&quot; &quot;Mr. Knight&quot; and &quot;Blues To Elvin&quot; are absolute classics. \n\n\nCD / Atlantic / 1990 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. Blues to Elvin (Jones) \n2. Blues to Bechet (Coltrane) \n3. Blues to You (Coltrane)\n4. Mr. Day (Coltrane) \n5. Mr. Syms (Coltrane)  \n6. Mr. Knight (Coltrane) \n7.
