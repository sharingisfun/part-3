This album takes you to the corners of the globe and still has room for America and good ol' jazz.\n\nThe Tribute concert was an astonishing feat, Yanni being the first person to perform a major musical concert at the Taj Mahal and to illuminate it for the first time in history, and Yanni being the first Western music act to tour China. He even beat the Rolling Stones to it. Seriously, this album resulted from 2 years of planning, 30 flights around the globe, 100s of meetings with government officials and business representatives, and thousands of telephone conversations.\n\nBut, the music in this album is an unprecedented feat in its own right. It is dynamic, soothing, foreign, familiar, and energetic all it once. But most of all, it's NEW, but not New Age. Yanni finds himself combining his uncanny ability to create flowing and romantic melodies and mystical world styles. There's also quite a bit of jazz in this. Highlights go to every single track because each one is unique and astonishing in its own way.\nI normally don't do track by track analysis, but when I do, you know an album as a winner.\n\n&quot;Deliverance&quot; (written for the people of India) is perhaps more ambitious than Standing in Motion from Live at the Acropolis. Foreign flutes, vocals, and country/jazz violin along with an arabic flare produces a very unique sound. &quot;Nightingale&quot; is (although a bit lacking of energy) unique in that the oriental elements are injected so heavily it. Violin is featured with it along with flute and a short cello solo. &quot;Waltz in 7/8&quot; is more Spanish than Arabic, but unique in the fact that you've got this foreign musical style and hear comes the keyboards giving you pure jazz. Both &quot;Tribute&quot; and &quot;Adagio in C Minor&quot; are geared more heavily to the classical side, not my kind of music, but still wonderfully orchestrated. &quot;Renegade&quot; finds Yanni experimenting with jazz in this sax/violin duet in a jazz/funk setting. A very likable combination. Much attention has gone to Ethnicity's &quot;The Promise&quot; and &quot;Almost a Whisper&quot; because they're basically Yanni's older songs with lyrics. Did you know &quot;Love is All&quot; is incredibly similiar to The Mermaid (Out of Silence)? &quot;Niki Nana&quot; is a wonderful treat for his fans, offering a global choir type sound, wonderful flute improv, the didgeridoo, and just plain fun. And of course, none of us should forget the jazzy &quot;Dance with a Stranger&quot; which features the trumpet and some more great keyboard solos.\nThis album is really worth your money. In fact, I'm surprised that it doesn't cost more. It'd still be worth your money even if it did. I'd recommend this album to anyone, whether you listen to Sum 41 or 50 cent, or Mozart and Bach.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nYanni - Tribute\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Yanni\nAlbum................: Tribute\nGenre................: New Age\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1997 11 04\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 65 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 253kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
