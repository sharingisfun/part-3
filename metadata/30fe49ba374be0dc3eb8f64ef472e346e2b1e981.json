GombrichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling history of the world for young readers tells the story of mankind from the Stone Age to the atomic bomb, focusing not on small detail but on the sweep of human experience, the extent of human achievement, and the depth of its frailty. The product of a generous and humane sensibility, this timeless account makes intelligible the full span of human history. In forty concise chapters, Gombrich tells the story of man from the stone age to the atomic bomb. In between emerges a colorful picture of wars and conquests, grand works of art, and the spread and limitations of science. This is a text dominated not by dates and facts, but by the sweep of mankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience across the centuries, a guide to humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s achievements and an acute witness to its frailties.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nStarred Review. This is an unusual work for Yale: a children's history originally published 70 years ago. But it is a work one can quickly come to love. Gombrich, later known as an art historian, wrote this primer in 1935, when he was a young man in Vienna (it was soon banned by the Nazis as too &quot;pacifist&quot;). Rewritten (and updated) in English mainly by Gombrich himself (who died in 2001, age 92, while working on it), the book is still aimed at children, as the language makes clear: &quot;Then, slowly the clouds parted to reveal the starry night of the Middle Ages.&quot; But while he addresses his readers directly at times, Gombrich never talks down to them. Using vivid imagery, storytelling and sly humor, he brings history to life in a way that adults as well as children can appreciate.The book displays a breadth of knowledge, as Gombrich begins with prehistoric man and ends with the close of WWII. In the final, newly added chapter, Gombrich's tone sadly darkens as he relates the rise of Hitler and his own escape from the HolocaustÃ¢â‚¬â€children, he writes, &quot;must learn from history how easy it is for human beings to be transformed into inhuman beings&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€and ends on a note of cautious optimism about humanity's future.

Thirty years later, a second German edition was published with a new final chapter. In 40 brief chapters, Gombrich relates the history of humankind from the Stone Age through World War II. In between are historic accounts of such topics as cave people and their inventions (including speech), ancient life along the Nile and in Mesopotamia and Greece, the growth of religion, the Dark Ages, the age of chivalry, the New World, and the Thirty Years' War. Much of this history is told through concise sketches of such figures as Confucius, Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Jesus Christ, Charlemagne, Leonardo da Vinci, Napoleon, and Columbus. Gombrich was asked to write a history geared to younger readers, so the book is filled with innumerable dates and facts, yet it is one to be read by adults. With 41 black-and-white woodcut illustrations and nine maps, it is a timeless and engaging narrative of the human race. George Cohen\nCopyright Ã‚Â© American Library Association.

Nor did he study history at university: art history was his subject. He was therefore delighted and astonished in almost equal degree that his very first book, Eine kurze Weltgeschichte fÃƒÂ¼r junge Leser, should have endured so long and found so many friends all over the world.\nHe wrote it as a young man and in a considerable rush, and later considered that both these factors contributed to its long lived appeal. For this little book would never have been written at all were it not for the unusual circumstances that presented themselves in Vienna in 1935.\nWhen the book came out, in 1936, it was very well received, reviewers assuming that my grandfather must be an experienced teacher. Though publication was stopped by the NazisÃ¢â‚¬â€because they considered the outlook &quot;too pacifist&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€it was reissued thirty years later. My grandfather added a new final chapterÃ¢â‚¬â€and was once again delighted by the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success, and the many translations that have followed.\n&quot;I want to stress,&quot; he wrote, in his preface to the Turkish edition a few years ago, &quot;that this book is not, and never was, intended to replace any textbooks of history that may serve a very different purpose at school. I would like my readers to relax, and to follow the story without having to take notes or to memorise names and dates. In fact, I promise that I shall not examine them on what they have read.&quot;\n\nAbout the Author\nAmong E. H. GOMBRICHÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many writings are the international bestsellers The Story of Art and Art and Illusion. He was director of the Warburg Institute of the University of London from 1959 to 1976.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30fe49ba374be0dc3eb8f64ef472e346e2b1e981","amp;dn":"E.+H.+Gombrich+-+A+Little+History+of+the+World+%5B2005%2C+2008%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30fe49ba374be0dc3eb8f64ef472e346e2b1e981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,254,73,186,55,75,224,220,62,184,246,78,244,114,227,70,226,177,233,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
