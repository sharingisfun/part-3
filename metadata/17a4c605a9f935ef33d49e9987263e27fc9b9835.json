Many of these characters live in a utopian future of instant connection and technological gratification that belies an unbridgeable human distance, while others inhabit a post-collapse landscape made primitive by disaster, which they must work to rebuild as we once did millennia ago.\r\nIn â€œThe Cartographers,â€ the main character works for a company that creates and sells virtual memories, while struggling to maintain a real-world relationship sabotaged by an addiction to his own creations. In â€œSaying Goodbye to Yang,â€ the robotic brother of an adopted Chinese child malfunctions, and only in his absence does the family realize how real a son he has become.\r\nChildren of the New World grapples with our unease in this modern world and how our ever-growing dependence on new technologies has changed the shape of our society. Alexander Weinstein is a visionary new voice in speculative fiction for all of us who are fascinated by and terrified of what we might find on the horizon.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a4c605a9f935ef33d49e9987263e27fc9b9835","amp;dn":"Children+of+the+New+World+-+Alexander+Weinstein+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a4c605a9f935ef33d49e9987263e27fc9b9835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,164,198,5,169,249,53,239,51,212,158,153,135,38,62,39,252,155,152,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
