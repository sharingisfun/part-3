Every song in this is 320 Kbps, ensuring the best sound that you can get besides FLAC. \nPlease enjoy this torrent.\n\n~Faerco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:021ab149d2039a7df22e09ddcfd2ab08e71c29d7","amp;dn":"Billy+Currington+Discography+%282002-2011%29+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"021ab149d2039a7df22e09ddcfd2ab08e71c29d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,26,177,73,210,3,154,125,242,46,9,221,207,210,171,8,231,28,41,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
