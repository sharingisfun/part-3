When there is so much information available on the topic, it can be difficult to get a complete overview of the latest developments. The Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Series provides a comprehensive resource of books covering key topics such as the characterisation, performance and properties of nanostructured materials and technologies and their applications. With contributions from leading experts in nanoscale research, the books are suitable for graduate student level and above in chemistry, materials science, engineering, biology and physics wanting to know more about nanoscience.\r\n\r\nSeries DOI:  10.1039/1757-7144\r\nPrint ISSN:  1757-7136\r\nSeries ISSN:  1757-7136\r\n\r\nSeries editor(s)\r\n\r\nPaul O'Brien \r\nUniversity of Manchester, UK \r\nEditor-in-Chief\r\n\r\nXiaogang Liu \r\nNational University of Singapore, Singapore \r\nSeries Editor\r\n\r\nRalph Nuzzo \r\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA \r\nSeries Editor\r\n\r\nJoao Rocha \r\nUniversity of Aveiro, Portugal \r\nSeries Editor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80b943396db3f877ad9e0abcb5eb89df9e0e4e8","amp;dn":"RSC+Nanoscience+and+Nanotechnology+%5BUpdated+at+2016.10.04%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80b943396db3f877ad9e0abcb5eb89df9e0e4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,11,148,51,150,219,63,135,122,217,224,171,203,94,184,157,249,224,228,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
