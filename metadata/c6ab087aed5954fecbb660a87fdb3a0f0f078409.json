To  win  this  game,  you  must become a roving\ndetective,  sniffing  out  the  answers  to  the  classic\nmystery questions: Who among Mr. Boddy's guests committed\nthe  murder?  What  was  the  murder  weapon? (Lead pipe?\nWrench?   Candlestick?)  Where  did  the  murder  happen?\n(Library?  Conservatory?) Because the answers change each\ntime, the game is constantly challenging. A gameboard map\nof  the  mansion,  detective  notepad, deck of cards, two\ndies,  wandering  playing  pieces,  and  a healthy dose of\nintuition  will  help  players be the first to figure out\nthe answers. This edition of Clue is a departure from the\nold  faces  and mansion rooms that were beginning to look\ndated  after  all these years. Sultry Miss Scarlett looks\nlike  Lesley  Ann  Warren from the movie Clue . Mr. Green\nlooks  convincingly  sinister,  Mrs. Peacock snobbish and\npotentially  cruel.  Colonel  Mustard  is  still Pompous,\nProfessor    Plum    still   clueless.  Mrs.  White,  the\ngrandmotherly maid, is downright spooky.\n\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES:\n\n1. Unrar, unzip and install the program.\n2. Replace the original .dll with the one in crack.zip\n3. Enjoy !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6ab087aed5954fecbb660a87fdb3a0f0f078409","amp;dn":"Clue+Classic+Board+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6ab087aed5954fecbb660a87fdb3a0f0f078409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,171,8,122,237,89,84,254,203,182,96,168,127,219,58,15,15,7,132,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
