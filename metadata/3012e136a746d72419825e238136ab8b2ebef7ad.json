As far as I know all the other files offered since are copies of this original upload and are as broken.\n\nISM FILE INFO: This ISM is made of 2 PDF files, one for the STATICS part (48 MB) and the other for the DYNAMICS part (51 MB), zipped and downloadable seperately. Each is paginated, chapter-bookmarked and true PDF. The 2 files come foldered.\nCompressed (zipped): *right-click* either filename (.7z) &amp; choose *Extract* to convert to PDF; discard the .7z files (containing folder) when done with seeding.\n\nCOMMENT: Solutions include problem statements so these manuals can serve as extra sets of solved problems for other textbooks covering engineering mechanics (Meriam &amp; Kraige, Hibbeler, Bedford &amp; Fowler, Riley &amp; Sturges,...).\n\n\n***  W A R N I N G  ***\n\nMake sure you understand the perils and pitfalls of using full solutions manuals like this one.\nSee: &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10954563/Calculus_Early_Transcendental_Functions_6th_Larson_solutions_ISM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10954563/Calculus_Early_Transcendental_Functions_6th_Larson_solutions_ISM&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3012e136a746d72419825e238136ab8b2ebef7ad","amp;dn":"Vector+Mechanics+for+Engineers+10th+c2013+Beer+solutions+ISM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3012e136a746d72419825e238136ab8b2ebef7ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,18,225,54,167,70,215,36,25,130,94,35,129,54,171,139,46,190,247,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
