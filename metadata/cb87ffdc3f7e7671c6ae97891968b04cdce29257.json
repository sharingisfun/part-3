Since World War II we have been conditioned to believe that America's motives in 'exporting' democracy are honorable, even noble. In this startling and provocative book, William Blum, a leading dissident chronicler of US foreign policy and the author of controversial bestseller Rogue State, argues that nothing could be further from the truth. Moreover, unless this fallacy is unlearned, and until people understand fully the worldwide suffering American policy has caused, we will never be able to stop the monster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb87ffdc3f7e7671c6ae97891968b04cdce29257","amp;dn":"America%27s+Deadliest+Export-+William+Blum+%5BPDF+%26amp%3B+Epub%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb87ffdc3f7e7671c6ae97891968b04cdce29257","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,135,255,220,63,126,118,113,198,174,151,137,25,104,176,76,220,226,146,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
