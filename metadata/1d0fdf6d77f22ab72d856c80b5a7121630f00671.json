So, here's what you missed: Within a walled city, just outside the ruins of downtown Chicago in a post-apocalyptic world over two centuries in the future, people are divided into five factions which perform the major functions of society. The Erudite faction is made up of the smart people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and they are the society's rulers. Candor is the faction for honest people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ society's judges. Dauntless are the strong, athletic and fearless Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the perfect people to help keep order. The Abnegation faction includes the selfless souls who help others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and, last but not least, Amity is a community of peaceful farmers. At about the age that people graduate from high school in our society, in this brave new &quot;Divergent&quot; world, these young adults take a virtual reality test that reveals their aptitude Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is supposed to be their destiny.\n\nThis is a real problem of Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley). Her test results are inconclusive. She shows attributes of multiple factions. That makes her &quot;divergent&quot;, a threat to the social order. She conceals her divergence, picks Dauntless as her faction, changes her name to Tris and begins her training. She struggles, but works very hard to succeed. If she flunked out, she'd become &quot;Factionless&quot;, a group of homeless people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ without jobs and without a place in society. Although Tris does start doing better in her training, she is found out to be divergent. She ends the first film on the run with her brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Peter (Miles Teller), who is her Dauntless classmate and bitter rival, and a young man who calls himself &quot;Four&quot; (Theo James) and is her Dauntless instructor and newfound love interest.\n\nThe &quot;Insurgent&quot; story picks up just days after the story in &quot;Divergent&quot; ends. Tris, Four, Caleb and Peter are hiding out with the Amity faction, led by Johanna (Octavia Spencer). Tris is racked with guilt over the death of her parents, but she keeps trying to suppress her feelings (along with her feelings for Four) because she's intent on getting to the Erudite leader, Jeannine (Kate Winslet) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and killing her. But first, these rebels have to find the rest of their fellow Dauntless friends that left the training complex with them Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and avoid the Dauntless citizens who remained loyal to Jeanine, and are still being led by Eric (Jai Courtney) and Max (Mekhi Phifer). While Tris is trying to get to Jeanine, Jeanine continues to hunt Divergents, but not just because she considers them a threat. Jeannine's minions have found a metal box decorated with the symbols of each of the factions. It contains a message from their society's founders; something that Jeannine believes will validate her authority. In the meantime, Tris and company also encounter Candor, led by Jack Kang (Daniel Day Kim), and a group of the Factionless, led by a mysterious woman named Evelyn (a brunette Naomi Watts). All the factions play significant roles in this film, as do the major characters who survived the first film, one who didn't, and some interesting new characters.\n\nThis is the first sequel I've reviewed and spent more time talking about the original film than the one I'm reviewing, but there are good reasons for that. First of all, unlike most well-done sequels, it's hard to appreciate the second without understanding what happened in the first. The context is important and you can't talk about &quot;Insurgent&quot; without knowing the basic vocabulary from &quot;Divergent&quot;. Secondly, there are so many twists, turns and surprises in this second film that I can't say much about the story without revealing major plot points. It's not that the sequel's plot is hard to follow, but I really try to stay away from spoilers. All this is a way of saying that this second film of &quot;The Divergent Series&quot; builds very well on the story of its predecessor and doesn't waste any time establishing an identity of its own.\n\nAs great a job as the first film did highlighting the importance of being yourself, &quot;The Divergent Series: Insurgent&quot; writes that message as if with lightning. The action is heightened in the second installment and so is the emotion. And adding to the message of individuality are powerful messages of selflessness and forgiveness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ forgiveness of others and of yourself. The story is fast-paced and thrilling, the climactic scene is shocking and profound (at least, for those of us who haven't read the books) and the ending is to die for. A lot of the professional critics don't seem to like this movie very much, but I think they're missing something. Maybe I'm just divergent, but I'm giving this film an &quot;A.&quot;\n\nScreens:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1.imageban.ru/out/2015/03/24/b6c7ade43145c6630cfe52e01829e6f3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1.imageban.ru/out/2015/03/24/b6c7ade43145c6630cfe52e01829e6f3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i6.imageban.ru/out/2015/03/24/2e823abb3149ef73fbe284a064015a2b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i6.imageban.ru/out/2015/03/24/2e823abb3149ef73fbe284a064015a2b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i6.imageban.ru/out/2015/03/24/bf0fefa196b1226abfe1d2f63abb943d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i6.imageban.ru/out/2015/03/24/bf0fefa196b1226abfe1d2f63abb943d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i6.imageban.ru/out/2015/03/24/7cde32dcd6550a3c2a5a7f19013e9b4e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i6.imageban.ru/out/2015/03/24/7cde32dcd6550a3c2a5a7f19013e9b4e.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSample:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sendfile.su/1099987&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sendfile.su/1099987&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0fdf6d77f22ab72d856c80b5a7121630f00671","amp;dn":"Insurgent+%282015%29+CAMRip+%5BRUS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d0fdf6d77f22ab72d856c80b5a7121630f00671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,15,223,109,119,242,42,183,45,133,108,128,181,167,18,22,48,240,6,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
