It was recorded on April 21Ã¢â‚¬â€œ22, 1999 at The Berkeley \nCommunity Theatre. This is the final Metallica album to feature Jason Newsted as bassist.\n \nS&amp;M contains performances of Metallica songs with additional symphonic accompaniment, which was composed\n by Michael Kamen, who also conducted the orchestra during the concert. The idea to combine heavy metal with an epic\n classical approach, as James Hetfield has stated repeatedly,was an idea of Cliff Burton. BurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love of\n classical music, especially of Johann Sebastian Bach, can be traced back to many instrumental parts and melodic \ncharacteristics in MetallicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting including songs from Ride The Lightning and Master of Puppets.The other \ninspiration was Deep Purple's 1969 Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Purple revived their hybrid musical performance \nin 1999's Live at the Royal Albert Hall after being notified that Metallica were doing theirs earlier that year.\n\n=======================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1\tThe Ecstasy of Gold\t1:58\n2\tThe Call of Ktulu\t8:44\n3\tMaster of Puppets\t8:15\n4\tOf Wolf and Man\t4:17\n5\tThe Thing That Should Not Be\t6:36\n6\tFuel\t4:38\n7\tThe Memory Remains\t4:44\n8\tNo Leaf Clover\t5:45\n9\tHero of the Day\t4:47\n10\tDevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dance\t5:28\n11\tBleeding Me\t9:01\n12\tNothing Else Matters\t6:50\n13\tUntil It Sleeps\t4:15\n14\tFor Whom the Bell Tolls\t4:54\n15\tÃ¢Ë†â€™ Human\t4:22\n16\tWherever I May Roam\t7:04\n17\tOutlaw Torn\t9:58\n18\tSad but True\t5:46\n19\tOne\t7:55\n20\tEnter Sandman\t7:39\n21\tBattery\t7:24\n\n================================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 3.06 GB\nAlbum                                    : S&amp;M\nPerformer                                : MetallicA\nGenre                                    : Metal\nRecorded date                            : 1999\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 3 371 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3146b8431d1f06b9be46fdf736bc9e4a67dd23a","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+S%26amp%3BM+%281999%29+Flac%5B24+Bit+96+KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3146b8431d1f06b9be46fdf736bc9e4a67dd23a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,20,107,132,49,209,240,107,155,228,111,223,115,107,201,228,166,125,210,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
