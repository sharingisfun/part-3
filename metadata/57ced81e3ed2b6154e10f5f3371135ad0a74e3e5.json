But Cazuza wanted more. It wanted all at once, in a continuous now . Discovered that music was the best way to express this urgency that had no beginning , no end had had no focus. Along with the Barons , Cazuza travels , knows Brazil , lives new affections . To mitigate the intensification of family conflicts , is summoned to work with his father , head of a record label. But he always wanted to live ever more intensely , breaking boundaries . The diagnosis was that the HIV virus was received by the young artist in despair , followed by the search for new forms of treatment for a disease which at the time represented a death sentence in the very short term . And it was precisely under this condemnation that Cazuza gave proof of courage unprecedented in the country : exposed the disease and its physical deterioration , he performed in public concerts moving , did not give the few pleasures left to him , willing to live as long as he had always wanted : true to yourself and your feelings . In doubtful future short lived , Cazuza never lied to himself or the people he loved . Cazuza died in 1990 at age 32 .\n\nTitle in Brazil Cazuza - Not The Time Stops\nOriginal title Cazuza - Time Stops\nRelease Year 2004\nGenre Drama\nCountry of Origin Brazil\n98 minutes Duration\nDirecting Walter Carvalho / Sandra Werneck\nPremiere in Brazil 11/06/2004\nStudio / Distrib .
