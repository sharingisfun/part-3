Insisting she's innocent, Emma tells Paul about a package sent to her father shortly before he entered the hospital. Bequeathed to him by a member of his unit from World War II, the box contains a key and a slip of paper. Emma fears that this package is connected to her father's death.\nWhen Paul's young assistant Sofia is murdered, Madriani is blindsided by the realization that Emma's fears are well-grounded.\n\nDigging into Robert's military history, Madriani discovers that other members of the Army unit Robert served with have recently diedâ€”under similarly suspicious circumstances. When he finds that the box sent to Brauer relates to a mysterious talisman that went missing at the end of the warâ€”a feared Nazi relic known as the &quot;Blood Flag&quot;â€”Madriani and Hinds realize they are in for the fight of their lives.\n\nWith Emma's life on the line and their own safety in jeopardy, Madriani must uncover the truth before the evil of the Blood Flag is allowed to spin a new web.\n\nWhen Emma Brauer is blamed in the mercy killing of her father, Paul Madriani and his partner, Harry Hinds, step in to defend her. Insisting she's innocent, Emma tells Madriani about a package sent to her father. Bequeathed to him by a fellow soldier from World War II, the box contains only a key and a slip of paper.\n\nMadriani uncovers a trail leading to a mysterious talismanâ€”a feared Nazi relic known as the Blood Flag. Soaked in the blood of a fallen Nazi follower, it went missing at the end of the war, turning it into a historic prize sought by collectors and others with darker motives. Racing to locate the artifact before it falls into the wrong hands, Madriani is in for the fight of his life.\n\nIn one of his most perilous cases yet, with Emma's life on the line and his own safety in jeopardy, Madriani must uncover the truth before more people die in the struggle over the Blood Flag and its horrific legacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f186ff215e1206d5f7bcdae4fb06da46005761f8","amp;dn":"BLOOD+FLAG+-+Steve+Martini+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f186ff215e1206d5f7bcdae4fb06da46005761f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,134,255,33,94,18,6,213,247,188,218,228,251,6,218,70,0,87,97,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
