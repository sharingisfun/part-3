Led by FermÃƒÂ­n IV, Pato (later Patricio Ch. Elizalde), and Toy Kenobi (Toy HernÃƒÂ¡ndez), the band returned in March of 1999 with Artilleria Pesada, produced by Antonio HernÃƒÂ¡ndez and Jason Roberts. In addition, FermÃƒÂ­n IV recorded a song alongside Cypress Hill called &quot;Siempre Peligroso,&quot; which was featured on the album Grandes Exitos en EspaÃƒÂ±ol. He also participated in Chris Vrenna&amp;#039;s project Tweaker and played with Los Angeles-based hip-hop act OMD. The long parade of outside work may have caused his exit from the band, just after his 2002 solo debut Boomerang. The rest of the band returned in 2003 with a new direction and a new record, Uno, Dos: Bandera.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00c6efb086a4eff97f32c3316d236c825941c7d4","amp;dn":"Control+Machete+%28Rap%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00c6efb086a4eff97f32c3316d236c825941c7d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,198,239,176,134,164,239,249,127,50,195,49,109,35,108,130,89,65,199,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
