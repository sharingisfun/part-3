But although the Skatalites are an obvious reference point (this band even includes trombonist Rico Rodriguez, a former Skatalite), this definitely isn't the junior version. Sure there's some of the same material, but Jazz Jamaica's sound is rooted in the more complex rhythms of reggae, using that as a jumping-off point to the infinite spaces of jazz. The originals cook beautifully, and their version of Charlie Parker's &quot;Barbados&quot; fairly sizzles with enthusiasm and skill. The rhythm section is as supple as willow, and the soloists are as inventive and melodic as you could hope. The ideal mix of fire and skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n1. Barbados\r\n2.
