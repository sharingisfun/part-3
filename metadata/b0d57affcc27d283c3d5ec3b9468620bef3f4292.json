They slaughter everyone inside and all escape without stealing a dime and leaving only a message for police warning that another attack is coming.

But even if she is able to save the day, two enemies from her past are lurking right in her blind spot, ready to take advantage of her current preoccupation . . .\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0d57affcc27d283c3d5ec3b9468620bef3f4292","amp;dn":"Flash+Point+-+Colby+Marshall+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0d57affcc27d283c3d5ec3b9468620bef3f4292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,213,122,255,204,39,210,131,195,213,236,59,148,104,98,11,239,63,66,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
