The main character, Keiichi Maebara, moves to Hinamizawa and befriends his new classmates Rena Ryugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hojo. Keiichi joins their after-school club activities, which consist mostly of card and board games (and punishment games for the loser, usually him.)\nHinamizawa appears to be a normal, peaceful, rural village to Keiichi.\n\nHowever, the tranquility abruptly ends after the annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration to commemorate and give thanks to the local god, Oyashiro-sama. Keiichi learns that every year for the past four years, one person has been murdered and another has gone missing on the day of the Watanagashi Festival. Keiichi himself soon becomes drawn into the strange events surrounding the Watanagashi Festival and Oyashiro-sama. In each story arc, he or one of his friends become paranoid, and a crime is committed. Usually, the crime involves the murder of one of their own friends. While it seems impossible to tell their delusions apart from the mystery of Hinamizawa, slowly the truth is revealed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:402b6ed86ac4b6b7ea3c031723241e1b9e92b39f","amp;dn":"Higurashi+No+Naku+Koro+Ni+%5BENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"402b6ed86ac4b6b7ea3c031723241e1b9e92b39f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,43,110,216,106,196,182,183,234,60,3,23,35,36,30,27,158,146,179,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
