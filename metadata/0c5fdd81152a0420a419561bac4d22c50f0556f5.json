Rhythmically, the music harkens back to\n          the basic crunch of the Rolling Stones and the dancing pop of the Beatles, while     \n          Petty's gravelly vocals and sing-song narrative style suggest roots in the folk-blues\n          Americana of Bob Dylan. This new Greatest Hits collection replaces the classic hit of\n          &quot;Something in the Air&quot; with &quot;Stop Dragging My Heart Around&quot; featuring Stevie Nicks.  \n                                                                                               \n          I'm glad to see this album remastered. If you own the 1993 version and you decide to \n          buy this because you had heard that the sound was going to be great, right you are!  \n          There is a huge difference in terms of sound here.                                   \n                                                                                               \n          And, of course, this collection has all the Tom Petty songs the casual fan will      \n          probably ever need. 1970s hits like 'Refugee,' 'American Girl,' 'Breakdown,' 'I Need \n          To Know' and 'Don't Do Me Like That' are here, as are his '80s hits like 'Free       \n          Fallin,' 'Don't Come Around Here No More' and 'Runnin' Down A Dream.'                \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.American girl               [03:33]                                        \n                 02.Breakdown                   [02:42]                                        \n                 03.Listen to her heart         [03:04]                                        \n                 04.I need to know              [02:24]                                        \n                 05.Refugee                     [03:22]                                        \n                 06.Don't do me like that       [02:42]                                        \n                 07.Even the losers             [03:39]                                        \n                 08.Here comes my girl          [04:25]                                        \n                 09.The waiting                 [03:59]                                        \n                 10.You got lucky               [03:36]                                        \n                 11.Don't come around here no   [05:04]                                        \n                    more                                                                       \n                 12.I won't back down           [02:57]                                        \n                 13.Runnin' down A dream        [04:23]                                        \n                 14.Free fallin'                [04:16]                                        \n                 15.Learning to fly             [04:02]                                        \n                 16.Into the great wide open    [03:44]                                        \n                 17.Mary jane's last dance      [04:33]                                        \n                 18.Stop draggin' my heart      [04:03]                                        \n                    around (with stevie nicks)                                                 \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               66:28 min                                       \n                                               103,2 MB      \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5fdd81152a0420a419561bac4d22c50f0556f5","amp;dn":"Tom_Petty_And_The_Heartbreakers-Greatest_Hits-%28Remastered_Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5fdd81152a0420a419561bac4d22c50f0556f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,95,221,129,21,42,4,32,164,25,86,27,172,77,34,197,15,5,86,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
