Both movies are based upon the life of Henry Hill, although the character is renamed to &quot;Vincent 'Vinnie' Antonelli&quot; in My Blue Heaven.\n\nWhile Goodfellas was based upon the book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, the screenplay for My Blue Heaven was written by Pileggi's wife, Nora Ephron, and much of the research for both works was done in the same sessions with Hill.\n\nThe movie was filmed primarily in the California city of San Luis Obispo and the surrounding area, though the nominal setting is a fictional suburb of San Diego, California. Some scenes were actually shot in San Diego. The film's title comes from the famous song which appears in the soundtrack, performed by Fats Domino.\n\nCast list\nSteve Martin - Vincent 'Vinnie' Antonelli\nRick Moranis - Barney Coopersmith\nJoan Cusack - Hannah Stubbs\nMelanie Mayron - Crystal\nBill Irwin - Kirby\nCarol Kane - Shaldeen\nWilliam Hickey - Billy Sparrow/Johnny Bird\nDeborah Rush - Linda\nDaniel Stern - Will Stubbs\nJesse Bradford - Jamie\nCorey Carrier - Tommie\nSeth Jaffe - Umberto Mello\nRobert Miranda - Lilo Mello\nEd Lauter - Underwood\nJulie Bovasso - Vinnie's Mother\nColleen Camp - Dr. Margaret Snow Coopersmith","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64d2d677f58a58ba35b4eaa5617d059f0c6979b2","amp;dn":"My+Blue+Heaven+%5B.x264%5D+Steve+Martin%2C+Rick+Moranis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64d2d677f58a58ba35b4eaa5617d059f0c6979b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,210,214,119,245,138,88,186,53,180,234,165,97,125,5,159,12,105,121,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
