In part, that&amp;#039;s due to ex-Beatles producer George Martin, whose considerable studio expertise nudged country-ish tunes like &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; as close to power pop as they were feasibly going to get. But the fact is that America had a genuine knack for crafting catchy, radio-ready singles, and this album offers just about all of them, including the Neil Young-esque &quot;Horse With No Name,&quot; and the genuinely lovely &quot;Ventura Highway.&quot;\n\nAmerica: Gerry Beckley (vocals, piano, bass); Dewey Bunnell (vocals, 6-string guitar); Dan Peek (vocals, 12-string guitar). Additional personnel: Henry Diltz (banjo); Joe Osborne, David Dickey (bass); Kim Haworth, Ray Cooper, Dave Atwood, Hal Blaine, Willie Leacox (drums, percussion); Chester McCracken (congas); Venetta Fields, Clydie King, Jessica Smith (background vocals). Producers: Ian Samwell, Jeff Dexter, America. Compilation producer: George Martin. Engineers include: Robin Black, Ken Scott, Geoff Emerick.\n\nSong Title \n \n  1. Horse With No Name, A \n  2.
