His two compositions on the Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young album DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu, &quot;Helpless&quot; and &quot;Country Girl,&quot; returned him to the folk and country styles he had pursued before delving into the hard rock of Everybody Knows; two other singles, &quot;Sugar Mountain&quot; and &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me,&quot; also emphasized those roots. But &quot;Ohio,&quot; a CSNY single, rocked as hard as anything on the second album. After the Gold Rush was recorded with the aid of Nils Lofgren, a 17-year-old unknown whose piano was a major instrument, turning one of the few real rockers, &quot;Southern Man&quot; (which had unsparing protest lyrics typical of Phil Ochs), into a more stately effort than anything on the previous album and giving a classic tone to the title track, a mystical ballad that featured some of Young's most imaginative lyrics and became one of his most memorable songs. But much of After the Gold Rush consisted of country-folk love songs, which consolidated the audience Young had earned through his tours and recordings with CSNY; its dark yet hopeful tone matched the tenor of the times in 1970, making it one of the definitive singer/songwriter albums, and it has remained among Young's major achievements.\n\n.: Locandina :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_makuxhDoAq1rvpx4g.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_makuxhDoAq1rvpx4g.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nTell Me Why\nAfter the Gold Rush\nOnly Love Can Break Your Heart\nSouthern Man\nTill the Morning Comes\nOh, Lonesome Me\nDon't Let It Bring You Down\nBirds\nWhen You Dance I Can Really Love\nI Believe in You\nCripple Creek Ferry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33179c4e359ead7e5a7e2e416d65267553193c23","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+After+The+Goldrush+%5BMp3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33179c4e359ead7e5a7e2e416d65267553193c23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,23,156,78,53,158,173,126,90,126,46,65,109,101,38,117,83,25,60,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
