The novel, set during the later stages of World War II from 1943 onwards, is frequently cited as one of the great literary works of the Twentieth century.[2]\n\nThe novel follows Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier, and a number of other characters. Most events occur while the airmen of the Fighting 256th (or &quot;two to the fighting eighth power&quot;) Squadron are based on the island of Pianosa, west of Italy. Many events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about the event from each iteration. The narrative also describes events out of sequence, and furthermore the events are referred to as if the reader already knows all about them.\n\nPlease seed 1:1\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0997080a7ecad794a242e3447c64aaadae8181a9","amp;dn":"Joseph+Heller+-+Catch+22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0997080a7ecad794a242e3447c64aaadae8181a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,151,8,10,126,202,215,148,162,66,227,68,124,100,170,173,174,129,129,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
