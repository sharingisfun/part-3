But previous winters have seen bitter lows of -22, as Britain was plunged into a deep freeze.\nWhat everyone wants to know now is: why is our weather getting more extreme, can we expect to see more of it in the future, and has it got anything to do with climate change?\nIn this episode of Horizon, physicist Dr Helen Czerski and meteorologist John Hammond make sense of Britain's recent extreme weather and discover that there is one thing that connects all our recent extreme winters - the jet stream, an invisible river of air that power along 10 km above us. What's worrying is that recently it has been behaving rather strangely. \nScientists are now trying to understand what is behind these changes in the jet stream. Helen and John find out if extreme winters are something we may all have to get used to in the future.\n\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e1ac80888fa1add2cfd1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo: Bitrate: 1505 Kbps\nVideo: Resolution: 852 x 480\nVideo: Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\nAudio: Codec: AAC LC \nAudio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio: Channels: stereo (2/0) \nAudio: English \nRun-Time: average 59mins\nFramerate: 25fps\nNumber of Parts: 5\nPart Size: average: 689 MB\nContainer: Mp4\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04b763n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04b763n&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63a05ca2ff0d2173bf6aba56cb5ca55ed2542bf7","amp;dn":"BBC.Horizon.2014.What.s.Wrong.with.Our.Weather.PDTV.x264.AAC..mp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63a05ca2ff0d2173bf6aba56cb5ca55ed2542bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,160,92,162,255,13,33,115,191,106,186,86,203,92,165,94,210,84,43,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
