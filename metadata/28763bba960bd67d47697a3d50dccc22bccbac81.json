Through a fresh and engaging examination of our evolutionary history, Dr. Moalem reveals how many of the conditions that are diseases today actually gave our ancestors a leg up in the survival sweepstakes. But Survival of the Sickest doesn't stop there. It goes on to demonstrate just how little modern medicine really understands about human health, and offers a new way of thinking that can help all of us live longer, healthier lives.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction/Medical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28763bba960bd67d47697a3d50dccc22bccbac81","amp;dn":"Survival+of+The+Sickest+-+Sharon+Moalem.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28763bba960bd67d47697a3d50dccc22bccbac81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,118,59,186,150,11,214,125,71,105,122,61,80,220,204,34,188,203,172,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
