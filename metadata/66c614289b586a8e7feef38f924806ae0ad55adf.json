A singer, songwriter, author, composer, and even orchestra conductor, he is mostly remembered for songs like &quot;Avec le Temps,&quot; &quot;Les Anarchistes,&quot; and &quot;Jolie MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´me.&quot; His career began in the cabaret and took him through four decades and a number of styles, but his best material and his popularity peak happened in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s and early ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s, as the generation of May ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“68 adopted him as an anarchist figure.\n\nLÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©o FerrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© was born and raised in the principality of Monaco, between France and Italy. Throughout his life, the artist would live and work in the two countries alternately, even recording a few songs in Italian. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=LEO|FERRE&amp;sql=11:gifexq9hld0e~T0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=LEO|FERRE&amp;sql=11:gifexq9hld0e~T0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9o_Ferr%C3%A9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9o_Ferr%C3%A9&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMp3 128-320 kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c614289b586a8e7feef38f924806ae0ad55adf","amp;dn":"Leo+Ferre+-+Discographie+-+1947-1959","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c614289b586a8e7feef38f924806ae0ad55adf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,198,20,40,155,88,106,142,127,238,243,143,146,72,6,174,10,213,90,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
