The rest of the set follows suit: &quot;Fran-Dance,&quot; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Straight, No Chaser,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Two Bass Hit,&quot; &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; (which has never sounded like this before or since), and the blistering &quot;The Theme&quot; all burn with white heat. The band swings hard, MilesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ melodies heading for the sky with an abandon rare in his discography. John ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solos, particularly on the lengthy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bye Bye Blackbird,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are knotted-forehead rants, forecasting the assaultive heights heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d reach in his solo career.\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Miles Davis at Newport 1958Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was the first gig where this band became a great band - something special in the history of jazz.\n\n\nMiles Davis Sextet\n\nMiles Davis at Newport 1958\n\n(Complete Set)\n\n \n CD / 2001 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
