The genius of all this is that Tatum wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t all cold and mathematical: this digitized singles collection is a Depression-era party album. The number that raises the bar for every historically aware hotshot keyboardist is Tiger Rag; the purist favourites here are St. Louis Blues, Bessie SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s After YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Gone and Hoagy CarmichaelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Stardust. But Tatum also ratchets up the adrenaline with ballads like Strange As It Seems, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Never Be the Same, a surprisingly visceral Tea for Two, Emaline and I Would Do Anything for You among the 25 brief, barely three-minute tracks here. \n\n01.

Six  selections recorded May 1, 1944, were subsequently issued on the Comet label. Each of these performances appeared on 12\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; 78-rpm records, allowing for well over four minutes of playing time. Weeks later -- on the summer solstice -- this inventive little group waxed four additional 12\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; sides for an independent recording company owned and operated by Moses Asch. As if obeying some cosmic rule of thumb, Tatum returned by himself to the Asch studios on the winter solstice to record six dazzling solos of incredible substance and depth. Vintage Tatum, beautifully played and intelligently presented.\n\n01. The Man I Love (4:16)\n02. Dark Eyes (4:44)\n03. Body &amp; Soul (4:37)\n04. I Know That You Know (4:20)\n05. On The Sunny Side Of The Street (4:35)\n06. Flying Home (4:15)\n07. Boogie (3:49)\n08. Topsy (4:11)\n09. If I Had You (3:27)\n10. Soft Winds (3:55)\n11. Fine And Dandy (2:51)\n12. It Had To Be You (2:40)\n13. Ja Da (2:33)\n14. Where Or When (2:48)\n15. Sweet And Lovely (2:57)\n16. Danny Boy (2:52)\n\n\nArt Tatum ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1945-1947 {The Chronological Classics\n\nThis portion of the Art Tatum chronology consists entirely of piano solos. Eight sides recorded for the ARA label in May of 1945 demonstrate Tatum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s amazing technique and ever-expanding repertoire. From 1945 until his early passing in 1956, the pianist would gradually expand his use of wild runs, glissandos, and arpeggios. Those tendencies are clearly audible in the recordings included on this compilation. Most of the V-Disc performances heard here are between three and a half and four minutes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' duration -- the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Gershwin Medley\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; runs nearly four and a half minutes. This allowed the pianist to stretch out and improvise more freely than he had been able to when operating within the confines of the three-minute record. Four Victor recordings from January 1947 conclude this fascinating chapter in the life and works of Art Tatum.\n\n01. Hallelujah! (3:04)\n02. Poor Butterfly (3:11)\n03. Song Of The Vagabonds (2:59)\n04. Lover (3:01)\n05. Memories Of You (3:08)\n06. Runnin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' Wild! (2:53)\n07. Yesterdays (3:08)\n08. Kerry Dance (2:28)\n09. Begin The Beguine (3:21)\n10.

His explosiveness, speed, and endlessly inventive arrangements make his recordings a thing apart, and this set is no exception. Try the familiar standards here like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Blue Skies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Tea for Two\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; to hear what Tatum brings to the table.
