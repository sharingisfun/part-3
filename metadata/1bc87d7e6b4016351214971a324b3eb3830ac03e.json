They are probably best known for the songs &quot;I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, &quot;I'm On My Way&quot; and &quot;Letter from America&quot;. The band tours extensively throughout Europe and other continents. They have released nine studio albums from 1987 until the present, as well as two compilation albums and a DVD.\n\nIn 2011, the band scored history in Scotland when two of their tracks, &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;, were featured on Scotland's Greatest Album (2011).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bc87d7e6b4016351214971a324b3eb3830ac03e","amp;dn":"The+Proclaimers+-+7+albums+1987+-+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bc87d7e6b4016351214971a324b3eb3830ac03e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,200,125,126,107,64,22,53,18,20,151,26,50,75,62,179,131,10,192,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
