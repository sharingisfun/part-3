All of its members currently play in various other groups and solo projects, mainly based around the city of Toronto. The band refuses the label &quot;supergroup,&quot; based on size or the ubiquity of their members, claiming that in the indie scene everyone is involved in more than one project. The group's sound could be considered a combination of all of its members' respective musical projects, and is occasionally considered baroque pop.[citation needed] It is characterized by a very large number of sounds, grand orchestrations featuring guitars, horns, woodwinds, and violins, unusual song structures, and an experimental, and sometimes chaotic production style from David Newfeld, who produced the second and third albums. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel Good Lost 2001\n\n\nFeel Good Lost is the 2001 debut album by Broken Social Scene. It was written and recorded primarily by founding members Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning. Unlike their better known 2002 outing You Forgot It in People, Feel Good Lost is a predominantly instrumental, Post-rock, ambient album, although it does feature some vocals by Leslie Feist and Kevin Drew.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;I Slept With Bonhomme at the CBC&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n2.\t&quot;Guilty Cubicles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03\n3.\t&quot;Love and Mathematics&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n4.\t&quot;Passport Radio&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n5.\t&quot;Alive in 85&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n6.\t&quot;Prison Province&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:42\n7.\t&quot;Blues for Uncle Gibb&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:59\n8.\t&quot;Stomach Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n9.\t&quot;Mossbraker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n10.\t&quot;Feel Good Lost&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:51\n11.\t&quot;Last Place&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:26\n12.\t&quot;Cranley's Gonna Make It&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Forgot it In People 2002\n\n\nYou Forgot It In People is a 2002 album by Broken Social Scene. It followed Feel Good Lost, and was the band's commercial and artistic breakthrough. You Forgot It In People features intricate, experimental production techniques and a large number of instruments coinciding with the band's vastly expanded size.\n\nMusic videos were made for a number of tracks, including singles &quot;Stars and Sons&quot;, &quot;Almost Crimes&quot;, &quot;Pitter Patter Goes My Heart&quot;, and &quot;Cause = Time&quot;. The album also features &quot;Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl&quot; and &quot;Lover's Spit&quot;, two songs that went on to become the band's biggest &quot;fan favorites.&quot;[citation needed]\n\nMany of the songs that didn't make it onto the album were featured in a B-sides compilation titled Bee Hives, released in 2004.\n\nIt won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year in 2003.\n\nIn Chart's 2005 reader poll of the 50 greatest Canadian albums of all time, conducted just three years after the album's release, You Forgot It In People ranked fourth, behind only Sloan's Twice Removed, Neil Young's Harvest and Joni Mitchell's Blue.\n\nIn 2009, Rhapsody (online music service) ranked the album #9 on its &quot;Alt/IndieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list.[1]\n\nThe album also placed 27th on Pitchfork Media's list of the 100 best albums from 2000 to 2004, 23rd on their list of the 100 best albums from 2000 to 2009, and 28th in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.\n\nStylus Magazine placed it seventh on their Top 50 Albums: 2000-2005.\n\nThe songs &quot;Cause = Time&quot; and &quot;Stars and Sons&quot; are listed at #145 and #275 on Pitchfork Media's Top 500 songs of the 2000's.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Capture the Flag&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:08\n2.\t&quot;KC Accidental&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n3.\t&quot;Stars and Sons&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n4.\t&quot;Almost Crimes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n5.\t&quot;Looks Just Like the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n6.\t&quot;Pacific Theme&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n7.\t&quot;Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n8.\t&quot;Cause = Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30\n9.\t&quot;Late Nineties Bedroom Rock for the Missionaries&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n10.\t&quot;Shampoo Suicide&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n11.\t&quot;Lover's Spit&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:22\n12.\t&quot;I'm Still Your Fag&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n13.\t&quot;Pitter Patter Goes My Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBee Hives 2004 \n\n\n\nBee Hives is a 2004 album by Broken Social Scene.

The album was originally to be titled Windsurfing Nation.[1]\n\nThe original artwork was to be a cartoon rendition of Pangaea, which was later scrapped in favor of the current artwork drawn by lead singer Kevin Drew.\n\nIn addition to the musicians who contributed to the band's prior release You Forgot It in People, new contributors on Broken Social Scene include k-os, Jason Tait (The Weakerthans) and Murray Lightburn (The Dears).\n\nThe initial domestic pressings of the album were issued with a seven-track bonus EP, EP To Be You and Me, a play on Marlo Thomas' children's record album Free to BeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ You and Me. The Japanese release is still issued with the EP. The vinyl pressing was released on two records, the first three sides being the album and the fourth being the EP.\n\nThe song &quot;Ibi Dreams of Pavement (A Better Day)&quot; refers to Canadian novelist Ibi Kaslik, a friend of the band.\n\nAt the 2006 Juno Awards it won the award for Alternative Album of the Year. It was also shortlisted for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize.\n\nHowever, the album divided critics more than its predecessor, 2002's You Forgot It in People. Whereas the earlier album had received almost universal critical praise, Broken Social Scene's looser, less structured songs were praised by some critics, but derided by others as self-indulgent and sloppy. Nevertheless, the album reached the number one position on American college charts and received widespread critical acclaim in the U.K.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Our Faces Split the Coast in Half&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n2.\t&quot;Ibi Dreams of Pavement (A Better Day)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n3.\t&quot;7/4 (Shoreline)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n4.\t&quot;Finish Your Collapse and Stay for Breakfast&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:24\n5.\t&quot;Major Label Debut&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n6.\t&quot;Fire Eye'd Boy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n7.\t&quot;Windsurfing Nation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n8.\t&quot;Swimmers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n9.\t&quot;Hotel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n10.\t&quot;Handjobs for the Holidays&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n11.\t&quot;Superconnected&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n12.\t&quot;Bandwitch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:58\n13.\t&quot;Tremoloa Debut&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:59\n14.\t&quot;It's All Gonna Break&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForgiveness Rock Record 2010\n\n\n\nForgiveness Rock Record is the fourth studio album by Canadian indie rock musical collective Broken Social Scene, released on Arts &amp; Crafts records on May 4, 2010.[11] The album is produced by John McEntire (Tortoise) and features guest appearances by Feist, Emily Haines (Metric), Spiral Stairs (Pavement) and Sebastien Grainger (Death from Above 1979).\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;World Sick&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Chase Scene&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Texico Bitches&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Forced to Love&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;All to All&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Art House Director&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Highway Slipper Jam&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Ungrateful Little Father&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Meet Me in the Basement&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Sentimental X's&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Sweetest Kill&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Romance to the Grave&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Water in Hell&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Me and My Hand&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLo-Fi for the Dividing Nights 2010\n\n\n\nLo-Fi for the Dividing Nights is an EP that was available by digital download when Forgiveness Rock Record was available for pre-order before May 4, 2010.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;New Instructions&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Sudden Foot Loss&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Shabba Lights&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Song for Dee&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Eling's Haus&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Professor Sambo&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Never Felt Alive&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Paperweight Room&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Turbo Mouse&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Far Out&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroken Social Scene Presents: Kevin Drew ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Spirit IfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ 2007\n\n\nSpirit If... is the debut solo album by Broken Social Scene co-founder Kevin Drew.

The album was released to retail on July 22, 2008.[1] Due to the leak of an unmastered version in mid-June, Canning has released the album as a digital download.[2] Quoted on the Arts&amp;Crafts website[3], Canning said:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tIt has come to my attention that an unmastered version of my album has been leaked through the internet. With the retail release being six weeks away, I've decided to correct the situation by releasing the album digitally myself, because I can. So this is for all you early birds who just couldn't wait for July 22nd. But you know, it won't be like going to your favourite record shop and getting a copy in your hot little hands, or sitting in your basement downloading it to your iTouch [sic] phone while playing Grand Theft Auto, it merely corrects the situation that is...a messed up version of my record floating around on the internet, and this is not how I wanted my record to drop. Believe me, this is not a minor situation. We're talking recall here folks...With all of this in mind, please note: 'Something for all of us...' will be available at all fine retail and digital outlets in North America July 22nd with some additional artwork inside and slightly later for the rest of the world.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe album has been generally warmly received. The album currently has a score of 70 out of 100 on Meta Critic[4] with high praise from Boston Globe, Almost Cool, Delusions of Adequacy, Billboard and No Ripcord. The album has also sold fairly well reaching the #17 spot on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Something for All of Us&quot; - 5:34\n2.\t&quot;Chameleon&quot; - 4:52\n3.\t&quot;Hit the Wall&quot; - 4:51\n4.\t&quot;Snowballs &amp; Icicles&quot; - 2:49\n5.\t&quot;Churches Under the Stairs&quot; - 4:20\n6.\t&quot;Love Is New&quot; - 4:07\n7.\t&quot;Antique Bull&quot; - 3:43\n8.\t&quot;All the Best Wooden Toys Come From Germany&quot; - 2:53\n9.\t&quot;Possible Grenade&quot; - 4:40\n10.\t&quot;Been at It So Long&quot; - 5:09\n11.\t&quot;Take Care, Look Up&quot; - 5:17\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Broken Social Scene :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8d09bad96b040cb9f3beb011df5cd1bcffb114","amp;dn":"Broken+Social+Scene+-+Discography+%282001+-+2010%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8d09bad96b040cb9f3beb011df5cd1bcffb114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,141,9,186,217,107,4,12,185,243,190,176,17,223,92,209,188,255,177,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
