Now she delivers her first stand-alone novel: an epic story of a city in the midst of seismic upheaval, a serial killer targeting cops, and a divided police force tasked with bringing a madman to justice.\n\nAtlanta, 1974: As a brutal murder and a furious manhunt rock the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s police department, Kate Murphy wonders if her first day on the job will also be her last. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to defy her privileged background by making her own wayÃ¢â‚¬â€wearing a badge and carrying a gun. But for a beautiful young woman, life will be anything but easy in the macho world of the Atlanta PD, where even the female cops have little mercy for rookies. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the worst day possible to start given that a beloved cop has been gunned down, his brothers in blue are out for blood, and the city is on the edge of war.\n\nKate isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only woman on the force whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feeling the heat. Maggie Lawson followed her uncle and brother into the ranks to prove her worth in their cynical eyes. When she and Kate, her new partner, are pushed out of the citywide search for a cop killer, their fury, pain, and pride finally reach the boiling point. With a killer poised to strike again, they will pursue their own line of investigation, risking everything as they venture into the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darkest heart.\n\nRelentlessly paced, acutely observed, wickedly funny, and often heartbreaking, Cop Town is Karin SlaughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful novel yetÃ¢â‚¬â€a tour de force of storytelling from our foremost master of character, atmosphere, and suspense.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d9629f45c86866b1e4302ad2aac80b69b75fb2c","amp;dn":"Karin+Slaughter+-+Cop+Town+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d9629f45c86866b1e4302ad2aac80b69b75fb2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,150,41,244,92,134,134,107,30,67,2,173,42,172,128,182,155,117,251,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
