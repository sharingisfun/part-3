A dystopian view of the future as a decaying, nostalgia-ridden junk culture, it features enormous neon billboards, ad blimps, and soaring Mayan temple-esque skyscrapers, evoking an infernal consumer society divided between those divinely living in the clouds and the multi-cultural exploited masses inhabiting the permanently dank streets. Only the robot &quot;skin job&quot; replicants understand the value of life and freedom. As Deckard's search for the replicants becomes a philosophical rumination on man, machine, and life, Blade Runner's striking production design and visual effects (supervised by FX maestro Douglas Trumbull) underline the cost to humanity of technology-obsessed late capitalism. Blade Runner's increasing stature merited the 10th anniversary release of the &quot;Director's Cut,&quot; which rendered the film even more evocatively ambiguous by adding a brief unicorn dream and eliminating the studio-mandated voice-over narration and tacked-on &quot;happy&quot; ending. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi .\n\nlearn more here : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/&lt;/a&gt;\n_____________________________________\n\nSeed asap with me as long as you can,please !\nWill probably take a certain time for you to get as my up speed is of 1 meg max.\nBe patient so !\nBtw,Transmission and libTorrent will be only accepted as fast peers.\nOthervise if you are running slow use KTorrent instead,please !!!\nARES client is formaly forbidden as it is crap and really really too slow.\nTransmission torrent client miss of big flexibility and the lack is terrific,really !\nPlease,i need to get and know few feedback and opinion from your part about this last one.\nThis will permit me to know if i do right or not then.\nTy for understanding\n...\nEnjoy and best regards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a89b7920437900741ede09141f2359093db925a","amp;dn":"BladeRunner-FinalCut.BDRip-%28Mkv.H264%40DTrHD%5D%29%28%5BAC3-5.1%29-US-FR.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a89b7920437900741ede09141f2359093db925a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,137,183,146,4,55,144,7,65,237,224,145,65,242,53,144,147,219,146,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
