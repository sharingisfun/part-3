Jakes's smash-hit &quot;Instinct&quot; shows readers how to tap into their God-given intuition to achieve ultimate success. \n\nWhether you call it following your heart, a gut feeling, a hunch or intuition, instinct - the inner knowledge bubbling up from a wellspring of wisdom within - can lead to a bigger, elephant-sized life.\n\nCombining social, business and personal examples with biblical insights, in &quot;Instict&quot; Bishop Jakes shows readers how to rediscover their natural aptitudes and reclaim the wisdom of their past experiences. Knowing when to close a deal, when to take a risk, and when to listen to their hearts will become possible when they're in touch with the instincts that God gave them. \n\nIf readers are ready to unlock the confines of where they are, and discover where they were meant to be, then &quot;Instinct&quot; is their key!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa0675a29137b87181be86895f5753466b00626","amp;dn":"Instinct+The+Power+to+Unleash+Your+Inborn+Drive+%28T.D.+Jakes%29+Ret","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa0675a29137b87181be86895f5753466b00626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,160,103,90,41,19,123,135,24,27,232,104,149,245,117,52,102,176,6,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
