R. Leavis as Britain's most influential academic critic.&quot;\n\nIn the 1980s, Eagleton engaged extensively with the various tides of continental thought that were impacting upon English Literature and he did so most famously in his book LITERARY THEORY: AN INTRODUCTION (1983) which remains an academic best-seller to this day.  Eagleton's specifically Marxist take on literary theory is evident throughout this book and clearly informs his continuing work on ideology, most famously THE IDEOLOGY OF THE AESTHETIC (1990), and some of his more recent work such as WHY MARX WAS RIGHT (2011).\n\nEagleton's Irishness connects with a Catholicism which is evident in recent works such as SWEET VIOLENCE (2003), HOLY TERROR (2005), and TROUBLE WITH STRANGERS (2008).  These books have played a part in Eagleton's development as a public intellectual, a role he takes on, for example, in THE MEANING OF LIFE (2007); a series of lectures on the New Atheism and the &quot;God Debate&quot; since published as REASON, FAITH, AND REVOLUTION (2008); and his 2013 book, ACROSS THE POND: AN ENGLISHMAN'S VIEW OF AMERICA.\n\nHe remains, however, more than ever concerned with the meaning of literature, hence THE ENGLISH NOVEL (2004), THE EVENT OF LITERATURE (2012), and HOW TO READ LITERATURE (2013).\n\n\nWith the several exceptions noted below, all the following books are in PDF format:\n\n* ACROSS THE POND: AN ENGLISHMAN'S VIEW OF AMERICA (Norton, 2013).
