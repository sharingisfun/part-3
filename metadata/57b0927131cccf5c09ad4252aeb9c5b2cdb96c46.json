Intended at first as a simple story of a boy's adventures in the Mississippi Valley Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a sequel to Tom SawyerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the book grew and matured under Twain's hand into a work of immeasurable richness and complexity. More than a century after its publication, the critical debate over the symbolic significance of Huck's and Jim's voyage is still fresh, and it remains a major work that can be enjoyed at many levels: as an incomparable adventure story and as a classic of American humor.\n\nEnriched eBook Features Editor R.
