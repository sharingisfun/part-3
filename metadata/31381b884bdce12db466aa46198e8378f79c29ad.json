It premiered on September 9, 1972 and ran for two seasons on CBS as the only hour-long Scooby-Doo series. Twenty-four episodes were ultimately produced (sixteen in 1972 and eight more in 1973). Each of the episodes of this series featured a special guest star, who would help the gang solve the mystery of the week. Some of these guest stars were living celebrities who provided their own voices; some were dead celebrities whose voicing was done by imitators and the rest were present or future Hanna-Barbera characters. All appeared on the show during or after their own shows' original runs. \n\nUpon attempting to release The New Scooby-Doo Movies on DVD in 2005, Warner Home Video was unable to negotiate agreements with several of the episodes' guest stars to have those episodes included in the DVD set. As a result, the DVD was released under the title The Best of the New Scooby-Doo Movies, and features fifteen episodes culled from both seasons. \n\nIn this torrent you will find every Episode Ripped form The Best of the New Scooby-Doo Movies and others Ripped form TV without commericals but there are all here.
