Because she always gets passed over and never gets chosen by customers, this kitty develops a sour outlook on life until..one day during the holidays, a very special 12-year-old girl named Chyrstal enters the pet store and falls in love with Grumpy Cat. A unique friendship is formed between the two when Chyrstal finds she is the only person who can hear this unique feline talk. In the middle of the holiday rush, Grumpy reluctantly thwarts the kidnapping of an expensive exotic dog she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand and rescues Chyrstal after the mall closes on Christmas Eve.
