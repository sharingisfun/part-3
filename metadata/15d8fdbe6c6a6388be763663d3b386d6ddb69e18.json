But when her dreams fall apart, Zoe decides to accept an offer from a stranger, Dr. Harley Wilkes, to work with him at his small practice in Bluebell, Alabama. Zoe arrives in this small Gulf Coast town only to find that Harley has passed away and left his half of the medical practice to her in his will.\n\nShe quickly finds that Southern hospitality isn't always so hospitableÃ¢â‚¬â€the other doctor in town, Brick Breeland, is less than pleased to be sharing the practice with this young outsider, and his daughter, Lemon, is a Southern belle whose sweet disposition turns sour when she meets Zoe. Zoe's only allies are the mayor, former football star Lavon Hayes, her bad-boy neighbor Wade Kinsella, and handsome lawyer George Tucker Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who just happens to be Lemon's fiancÃƒÂ©. Zoe is out of her element and ready to pack her bags, but a surprise visit by her snobby New York mother leads to Zoe's decision to stay in Bluebell for a while, discovering small-town life and a side of herself she didn't know was there.\n\n\n\n\nCast: Rachel Bilson\n      Jaime King\n      Cress Williams\n      Wilson Bethel\n      Tim Matheson\n      Scott Porter\n\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English - on some episodes\nResolution: 1920x1080 - S02E01 is in 720p\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChannels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: WEB-DL\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\n\nActual Screenshots:\n---------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/551/vlcsnap2013061219h50m06.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/551/vlcsnap2013061219h50m06.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/1268/vlcsnap2013061219h51m45.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/1268/vlcsnap2013061219h51m45.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/9783/vlcsnap2013061219h52m51.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/9783/vlcsnap2013061219h52m51.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/8941/vlcsnap2013061219h56m48.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/8941/vlcsnap2013061219h56m48.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8927/vlcsnap2013061219h59m35.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8927/vlcsnap2013061219h59m35.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4921/vlcsnap2013061220h00m20.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4921/vlcsnap2013061220h00m20.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/404/vlcsnap2013061220h00m56.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/404/vlcsnap2013061220h00m56.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIMDb:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1832979/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1832979/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cwtv.com/shows/hart-of-dixie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cwtv.com/shows/hart-of-dixie&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_of_Dixie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_of_Dixie&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d8fdbe6c6a6388be763663d3b386d6ddb69e18","amp;dn":"Hart+of+Dixie+Season+2+Complete+1080p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d8fdbe6c6a6388be763663d3b386d6ddb69e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,216,253,190,108,106,99,136,190,118,54,99,211,179,134,214,221,182,158,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
