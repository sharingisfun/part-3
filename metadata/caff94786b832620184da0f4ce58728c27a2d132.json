Here are the three books in the trilogy: House of Cards, To Play the King, and The Final Cut.\n\n1. House of Cards\n\nA dark tale of greed, corruption, and unquenchable ambition, House of Cards reveals that no matter the country, politics, intrigue and passion reign in the corridors of power. Francis Urquhart has his hand on every secret in politics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and is willing to betray them all to become prime minister. Mattie Storin is a tenacious young reporter who has a knack for finding the real stories hidden behind the spin. When she stumbles upon a scandalous web of intrigue and financial corruption at the very highest levels, she vows to reveal the truth. But to do so she must battle her own demons and risk everything, even her life.\n\n2. To Play the King\n\nAfter scheming his way to power in House of Cards, newly elected Prime Minister Francis Urquhart takes on the new King. The role of the monarchy in modern Britain comes under scrutiny as Prime Minister Francis Urquhart threatens to expose Royal secrets when his plans are blocked by the idealistic new King. Their differences of opinion quickly degenerate into open hostility. The battlefield ranges from architecture to the underprivileged; the battle is fought with rigged opinion polls, manipulated newspaper headlines, sexual scandal and economic brinkmanship as Urquhart sets out to destroy not only the King's family and friends but even the King himself.\n\n3. The Final Cut\n\nNow Francis Urquhart is about to take his place in the record books as the longest-serving Prime Minister this century. Yet it seems the public is tiring of him at last, and the movement to force him from power is growing. But Urquhart is not yet ready to be driven from office. If the public demands new blood, that is precisely what he will give them... This is a different Francis Urquhart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ more vulnerable, more loving, and more ruthless than ever. He will risk everything, but one thing is certain: whatever the outcome of this, his greatest gamble, the name of Francis Urquhart will never be forgotten.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caff94786b832620184da0f4ce58728c27a2d132","amp;dn":"The+House+of+Cards+Complete+Trilogy+-+Michael+Dobbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caff94786b832620184da0f4ce58728c27a2d132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,255,148,120,107,131,38,32,24,77,160,244,206,88,114,140,39,162,209,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
