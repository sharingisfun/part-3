Soon after, the band released their first full-length record 'Blood Sweat And No Tears' on In-Effect Records. Often revolving around politics, social injustices and life on the streets of New York, the band wore their heart on their sleeve and made no apologies, often including threads of positivity. When their second album 'Just Look Around' was released in 1992, it was a benchmark for the band and the New York hardcore scene, and kicked off their globe-trotting expansion with tours in Europe, South America and Japan. They released their breakthrough album 'Scratch The Surface' in 1994 on Atlantic, followed by the seminal album 'Built To Last' in 1997. After releasing three albums on Fat Wreck Chords, as well as a live album and a collection of rarities, the band took on the challenge to push themselves further. 'Death To Tyrants' was the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first cooperation with Century Media and was mixed by renowned metal producer Tue Madsen (The Haunted, Heaven Shall Burn, Dark Tranquillity,) adding a refreshingly heavy edge to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark NYHC sound. 'Death To Tyrants' was extremely well received by media and fans alike and followed up with three years of relentless touring.\n\nThe new album was also recorded with Tue Madsen, this time at Starstruck Studios in Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark, resulting in a massive metallic heaviness which increases the punch and drive of the new opus. Craig Ahead (bass) comments: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The end result of our three and a half weeks in the studio is something that we are all very proud of. An album that is pure SICK OF IT ALL and will stand up against any of our previous work and I believe raises the bar to a new standard. I hope you enjoy our offerings. We look forward to its release so we can again stomp the world. See you on tour!Ã¢â‚¬Å“ To walk the talk, the band plays a European tour with Dropkick Murphys in January/February 2010, followed by a UK run with AFI in April. More festival shows and touring activities are in the works.\n\n'Based On A True Story' is another sonic statement that SICK OF IT ALL are an institution of hardcore. Their longevity and conviction has kept the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation untarnished and legendary. As Metal Hammer (UK) puts it: Ã¢â‚¬Å“SICK OF IT ALL Ã¢â‚¬â€œ despite their ever-increasing age and fierce competition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are still the finest spokesmen for hardcoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social conscience and valuesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and this new release will allow them to maintain this leading position for many years to come!\n\n\n\nLine-up:\n\n\nLou Koller - Vocals\nPete Koller - Guitars\nCraig Setari - Bass\nArmand Majidi - Drums\n\nSick Of It All - Last Act of Defiance (2014)\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
