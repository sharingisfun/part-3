It was released in November 2001 and contains 19 tracks. The album contains two songs (&quot;Pretenders to the Throne&quot; and &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot;) that were released between Carry on up the Charts and Blue Is the Colour, and never made it onto any\n album.\nIt produced one single, &quot;The Root of All Evil&quot;, released the same month as the album, and only getting to number 50 in the UK\n Singles Chart. The album got to number 10. The name of the album parodies other compilation albums e.g. &quot;Solid Gold - Greatest\n Hits&quot; by self-deprecating the popularity of the band.\nThe Beautiful South was an English pop/rock group formed at the end of the 1980s by two former members of Hull group The\n Housemartins, Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway. Other members were Sean Welch (bass), Dave Stead (drums) and Dave Rotheray\n (guitar) and a succession of female vocalists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Briana Corrigan, Jacqui Abbott and Alison Wheeler.\nThe group broke up in January 2007, claiming the split was due to &quot;musical similarities&quot;,[1] having sold around 15 million \nrecords worldwide.In January 2009, it was announced that the former members Dave Hemingway, Alison Wheeler, and Dave Stead would\n reform under the name &quot;New Beautiful South&quot; which was later changed to &quot;The South&quot;.\n\n=======================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01 Rotterdam (Or Anywhere).flac\n02 Perfect 10.flac\n03 You Keep It All In.flac\n04 Don't Marry Her.flac\n05 A Little Time.flac\n06 Everybody's Talkin'.flac\n07 Good As Gold (Stupid As Mud).flac\n08 Dream A Little Dream.flac\n09 Song For Whoever.flac\n10 Old Red Eyes Is Back.flac\n11 The Root Of All Evil.flac\n12 One Last Love Song.flac\n13 Dumb.flac\n14 How Long's A Tear Take To Dry.flac\n15 Blackbird On The Wire.flac\n16 Closer Than Most.flac\n17 The River.flac\n18 Pretenders To The Throne.flac\n19 The Mediterranean (Morcheeba Mix).flac\n\n==========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 428 MB\nAlbum                                    : Solid Bronze - Great Hits\nTrack name/Total                         : 19\nComposer                                 : The Beautiful South\nGenre                                    : BritPop\nRecorded date                            : 2001\nComment                                  : EAC V1.0 beta 2, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC -8\nAlbum/Composer                           : The Beautiful South / The Beautiful South\n\n======================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 964 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42733763f4e91f47213c4d24fac451d6ebacb9b4","amp;dn":"The+Beautiful+South+-+Solid+Bronze+-+Great+Hits+%282001%29FLAC-Cue+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42733763f4e91f47213c4d24fac451d6ebacb9b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,115,55,99,244,233,31,71,33,60,77,36,250,196,81,214,235,172,185,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
