In this exquisite and taboo novel of passion and desire, the answer emerges through a daring exploration of the deepest bonds of sensual domination. Ã¢â‚¬Å“OÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer, determined to understand and prove her consuming devotion to her lover, RenÃƒÂ©, through complete submission to his every whim, his every desire.\n \nIt is a journey of forbidden, dangerous choices that sweeps her through the secret gardens of the sexual underground. From the inner sanctum of a private club where willing women are schooled in the art of subjugation to the excruciating embraces of RenÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s friend Sir Stephen, O tests the outermost limits of pleasure. For as O discovers, true freedom lies in her pure and complete willingness to do anything for love.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWikipedia page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_O&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_O&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c66fa5b191cf73011dcb460b7fbee83442c4ce12","amp;dn":"Story+of+O+-+Pauline+Reage+%5BeBook+PDF%5D+-+TorrentGator05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c66fa5b191cf73011dcb460b7fbee83442c4ce12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,111,165,177,145,207,115,1,29,203,70,11,127,190,232,52,66,196,206,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
