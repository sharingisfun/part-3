Nicknamed the &quot;Blonde Bomber&quot;, he first rose to fame as an early member of Scorpions, then achieved fame in the mid-1970s as the lead guitar player for UFO. Since leaving UFO in 1978, he has been leading the Michael Schenker Group in various incarnations. \r\n\r\nHe has rejoined UFO three times, producing an album each time. He is the younger brother of Rudolf Schenker, who is still a guitarist with Scorpions. His career has had many ups and downs, partly due to a long history of alcoholism and personal problems; still, Schenker continues to perform and record. He has been called &quot;a legendary figure in the history of metal guitar.&quot;\r\n\r\nALBUM : Special Of...\r\n    \r\nYear: 2015\r\n    \r\nCOUNTRY: Germany\r\n    \r\nStyle: Hard Rock\r\n    \r\nTime:\t01:08:44\r\n    \r\nFormat: mp3\r\n    \r\nBitrate: 320ak\r\n    \r\nSite:\twww.michaelschenkerhimself.com\r\n\r\n \r\nDescription\r\n\r\n01.
