For her contribution as a children's writer she received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1966.\n\nJansson is best known as the author of the Moomin books for children. The first such book, The Moomins and the Great Flood, appeared in 1945, though it was the next two books, Comet in Moominland and Finn Family Moomintroll, published in 1946 and 1948 respectively, that brought her fame.\n\nThe first Moomin book, The Moomins and the Great Flood, was written in 1945. Although the primary characters are Moominmamma and Moomintroll, most of the principal characters of later stories were only introduced in the next book, so The Moomins and the Great Flood is frequently considered a forerunner to the main series. The book was not a success (and was the last Moomin book to be translated into English), but the next two installments in the Moomin series, Comet in Moominland (1946) and Finn Family Moomintroll (1948), brought Jansson some fame. \n\nThe biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Jansson received the writing award in 1966.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe torrent contains following books in ePUB and Mobi format unless otherwise stated:\n\n*  The Moomin Books\n\n      Comet in Moominland\n\n      Finn Family Moomintroll\n\n      Moominland Midwinter\n\n      Moominpappa at Sea\n\n      Moomins and the Great Flood -- Mobi + PDF\n\n      Moominsummer Madness\n\n      Moominvalley in November\n\n      Tales From Moominvalley\n\n      The Exploits of Moominpappa\n\n\n*  Other Works\n\n      A Winter Book\n\n      Fair Play\n\n      Sculptor's Daughter -- ePUB + PDF\n\n      The Summer Book\n\n      The Travelling Light\n\n      The True Deceiver  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/15/tove-jansson-life-words-westin-review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/15/tove-jansson-life-words-westin-review&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/03/tove-jansson-moomin-creator-biography-review.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/03/tove-jansson-moomin-creator-biography-review.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/authors/tove-jansson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/authors/tove-jansson/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.moomin.com/en?g=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.moomin.com/en?g=1&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tovejansson.com/eng/matkalla.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tovejansson.com/eng/matkalla.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Tove-Jansson-s-Art-of-Play/ba-p/5513&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Tove-Jansson-s-Art-of-Play/ba-p/5513&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/04/how-tove-jansson-can-change-your-life&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/04/how-tove-jansson-can-change-your-life&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e5b64dcc524fe9f189cf8eacc6fc723a62129e6","amp;dn":"Tove+Jansson+-+Moomin+Books+%26amp%3B+Other+Works+%2815+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e5b64dcc524fe9f189cf8eacc6fc723a62129e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,91,100,220,197,36,254,159,24,156,248,234,204,111,199,35,166,33,41,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
