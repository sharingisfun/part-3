If you notice your computer is running slow, this typically is due to the memory (RAM) running out of usable space. When memory space gets lower, Windows then starts opening programs into the Windows page file; this page file is the computer hard drive which is much slower than RAM. SuperRam switches this behavior and puts old programs into the Windows page file and any newly opened programs are put into actual RAM. This change in how Windows operates allows programs and games to run faster.\nSuperRam constantly runs in the background on your computer and determines when the memory on your computer is getting to a low threshold; once it reaches this threshold it immediately frees memory back to the computer and makes programs run faster since they have access to physical memory. SuperRam's settings allow you to freely adjust and change this low memory threshold and give you the ability to determine how much memory to free back to Windows. SuperRam gives you full control over how memory works on your computer and allows you to fine tune how your computer operates.\n\nFaster Applications\nApplications and games instantly load and run faster than before since they have access to more RAM on your computer. This instantly makes your computer run smoother and faster.\n\nTake Control\nYou are now in control of your computer and decide how the system works. SuperRam gives you instant access to control how the computer operates and then works in the background for you.\n\nAlways Running\nSuperRam constantly runs in the background even if no user is logged in, works great for server systems and desktop machines whether they are in full use or idle.\n\nInfinite Memory\nSuperRam constantly frees wasted memory back to the computer giving the impression you have an unlimited supply of RAM available to your applications at all times.\n\n\nOS : Windows 8, 7, Vista, XP &amp; Windows Server 2012, 2008, 2003. 32-BIT/64-BIT ready\nLanguage : Multilingual\n\n+----------------+\n| How to use |\n+----------------+\n1) Stop the application if started\n2) Stop internet and Install application using provided installer and do not reboot\n3) Open Serial.txt and use one of serial provided\n\n\n\nSupport topic: &lt;a href=&quot; http://techtools.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=12&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://techtools.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=12&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   \nAny comments on quality appreciated\nThumperDC / TechTools\n\n\n====================================================================================\nIf you need help please post in our forum, Thanks &lt;a href=&quot; http://techtools.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://techtools.net/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n====================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee872f3f80b7381c25b3580080bac76e60f1848","amp;dn":"PGWARE+SuperRam+6.11.10.2014+%2B+Serial+%5BTechTools%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee872f3f80b7381c25b3580080bac76e60f1848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,232,114,243,248,11,115,129,194,91,53,128,8,11,172,118,230,15,24,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
