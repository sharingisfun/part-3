Effective and efficient food delivery systems are built around processes that maximize the effort while minimizing cost, time, and resource depletion.\nThis comprehensive reference is for engineers who design and build machinery and processing equipment, shipping containers, and packaging and storage equipment. It includes cutting-edge coverage of microwave vacuum application in grain processing, cacao processing, fruit and vegetable processing, ohmic heating of meat, facility design, closures for glass containers, double seaming, and much more.\n\n-    Provides cross-topic information for translational research and potential application\n-    Focuses on design and controls - written for engineers by engineers - always with practical applications in mind\n-    Includes design of machinery and facilities as well as theoretical basis for determining and predicting behavior of foods as they are handled and processed\n\nCONTENTS\n1.
