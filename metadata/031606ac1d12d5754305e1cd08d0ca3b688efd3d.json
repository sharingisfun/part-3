The band consists of vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk and pop rock elements.[1]\n\nThe Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, which became a commercial success and sold over five million copies in the United States. The group was one of the most successful rock acts of the '90s and sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. The band has achieved four top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?; No Need to Argue; To the Faithful Departed and Bury the Hatchet)[2] and eight top 20 singles on the Modern Rock Tracks chart (&quot;Linger&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Zombie&quot;, &quot;Ode to My Family&quot;, &quot;Ridiculous Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Salvation&quot;, &quot;Free to Decide&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot;).[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Cranberries :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031606ac1d12d5754305e1cd08d0ca3b688efd3d","amp;dn":"The+Cranberries+-+Discography+1993+-+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031606ac1d12d5754305e1cd08d0ca3b688efd3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,22,6,172,29,18,213,117,67,5,225,205,8,208,202,59,104,142,253,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
