Sure, R. Kelly, Brian McKnight, D'Angelo, Maxwell, Usher, Joe ... there was always someone out harder and stronger e'ery time 'Face dropped an LP of his own).\n\nHowever, listening to &quot;For the Cool in You&quot; 13 years after its release is a sweet reminder of the way things used to be.\n\nBack in the day, R&amp;B singers didn't HAVE to have rappers and multiple artist collaborations on their LPs to get noticed -- and &quot;For the Cool in You&quot; is an LP that's 100% 'Face and 100% R&amp;B.\n\nBabyface doesn't have a powerful voice or a deeply soulful voice. I can only offer that his swagger is more laid back and more conservative.\n\nBut sometimes less is more. That's what you get here.\n\nThe title track, &quot;Lady, Lady, Lady,&quot; &quot;And Our Feelings, &quot;Never Keeping Secrets&quot; and &quot;When Can I See You Again&quot; are all slow to midtempo tracks more appropriate for down time, perhaps low background music at your desk/on the job or just plain old great music to unwind to.\n\nBabyface got the ladies hooked on this LP b/c he comes correct with clear, simple, honest and heartfelt lyrics.\n\nThis album is proof you don't always need Usher's kind of high energy, Janet Jackson-esque dance-track-ability or beggin' ass Keith Sweat's persona to tell that special someone how you really feel about them.\n\nShort, sweet and cool.\n\nRecommended LP!!!!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBabyface - For the Cool in You\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Babyface\nAlbum................: For the Cool in You\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993\n\nMP3 320cbr\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
