They comprised Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), his younger brother David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion). Dire Straits' sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band's early years, the band's stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more &quot;rootsy&quot; influence that emerged out of pub rock. Many of Dire Straits' compositions were melancholic. Dire Straits became one of the world's most commercially successful bands, and sold over 120 million albums worldwide. \n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Dire Straits - Studio Discography \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Dire Straits\nAlbum................: Studio Discography\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1978 to 1991\nRipper...............: dBpowerAmp\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: All Are V0 VBR\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........:\nRipped by............: Bubanee\nIncluded.............: All Songs Contain Album Art\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting 6CDRips\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1. 1978 - Dire Straits (Self Titled)\n   2. 1979 - Comminque\n   3. 1980 - Making Movies\n   4. 1982 - Love Over Gold\n   5. 1985 - Brothers In Arms \n   6. 1991 - On Every Street\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89b5307c9da47e78bb1812fae5d0bd044c7433ee","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+Studio+Discography+6CDRip+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89b5307c9da47e78bb1812fae5d0bd044c7433ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,181,48,124,157,164,126,120,187,24,18,250,229,208,189,4,76,116,51,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
