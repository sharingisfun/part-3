Stunned by Pearl Harbor and a string of defeats, America needed a victory - badly. To that end, Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, a former air racer and stunt pilot, devises a plan for a daring raid on the heart of Japan itself. To do this, he must train army bomber pilots to do something no one ever dreamed possible - launch 16 fully loaded bombers from an aircraft carrier! Remarkable in its accuracy, this movie even uses film footage from the actual raid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c601b5a93166b1b2b78f83a49a39683a01bc734a","amp;dn":"Thirty+Seconds+Over+Tokyo+%28War+Drama+1944%29++Spencer+Tracy%2C+Van+J","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c601b5a93166b1b2b78f83a49a39683a01bc734a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,1,181,169,49,102,177,178,183,143,131,164,154,57,104,58,1,188,115,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
