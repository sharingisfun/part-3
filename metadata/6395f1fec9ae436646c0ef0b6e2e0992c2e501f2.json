Cleric John Preston (Bale) is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. When he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/4L6WooP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/4L6WooP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/KRH0nXa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/KRH0nXa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/vzryA7l&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/vzryA7l&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/ssFoYnI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/ssFoYnI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/UmOqes1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/UmOqes1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/Qtp72JM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/Qtp72JM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/jZCxZ7P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/jZCxZ7P&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/X8Fgrau&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/X8Fgrau&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/fo3ZBHg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/fo3ZBHg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Cast\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/57ye0p2k4tp1etpaz40k.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/57ye0p2k4tp1etpaz40k.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n    Christian Bale as John Preston\n    Emily Watson as Mary O'Brien\n    Taye Diggs as Andrew Brandt\n    Angus Macfadyen as Vice-Counsel DuPont\n    Sean Bean as Errol Partridge\n    William Fichtner as Jurgen\n    Matthew Harbour as Robbie Preston\n    Sean Pertwee as Father\n    David Hemmings as Proctor\n    Emily Siewert as Lisa Preston\n    Alexa Summer as Viviana Preston\n    Maria Pia Calzone as Preston's wife\n    Dominic Purcell as Seamus\n    Brian Conley as Reading room overseer\n    Kurt Wimmer as Rebel victim\n\n\n\n\n\nMEDIA-INFO\n\nBox Office\n\n\nBudget:$20.000.000 (estimated)\nOpening Weekend:$61.468 (South Africa) (12 September 2003)\nGross:$104.843 (South Africa) (19 September 2003)\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nThe &quot;kendo&quot;-type swords used during the sparing scene were designed specially for the film and are turned wood which broke quite easily during filming because Christian Bale and Taye Diggs were really whacking each other with them.\n\nGoofs\nDuring the flashback to Viviana Preston's arrest, when John twists the soldier's wrist to take his weapon the gun is an AR-15/M-16, but it then appears to instantly change to a Beretta AR-70 as he holds it on another guard - actually, this is not a continuity error; Preston first disarms a guard of his AR-15 type rifle (by breaking his fingers), then uses that rifle to deflect the weapon of another guard, whose AR-70 he grabs and turns on its owner (it's not possible to see which kind of rifle he uses during the lightning-quick deflect maneuver).\n\nQuotes\n[first lines]\nDuPont: In the first years of the 21st century, a third World War broke out. Those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive a fourth; that our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked. So we have created a new arm of the law: The Grammaton Cleric, whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man - his ability to feel.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/7kjtw02u8om1yqdsix1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/7kjtw02u8om1yqdsix1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n*Title.....................:  Equilibrium\n*Genre.....................:  Action | Drama | Sci-Fi | Thriller\n*Encoded/Released By.......: tomcat12\n*Year/Language.............: 2002/English\n*Source....................: Blu-ray Remux\n*Type/Writing Library......: MPEG-4 AVC/ x264 core 133 r2334 rc=2pass\n*Conteiner.................: mp4\n*File size.................: 3.47 GiB\n*Overall Bit Rate..........: 4 640 Kbps\n*Video Bit Rate............: 4 200 Kbps\n*AUDiO:....................: AAC / 6CH / 448 Kbps\n*Resolution................: 1 920 x 818 pixels\n*FPS/AR....................: 23.976 fps/2.35:1\n*Runtime/sample...................: 1h 47mn/01min\n*SUBTiTLES srt:.................: English,Spanish,Estonian,Romanian,\nIndonesian,Swedish,Greek,Croatian,Portuguese,Bulgarian.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/xa3caopjye64m6sfuvz8.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimgshost.com/fullsize/xa3caopjye64m6sfuvz8.gif&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6395f1fec9ae436646c0ef0b6e2e0992c2e501f2","amp;dn":"Equilibrium+2002+1080p+BDRip+AAC+x264-tomcat12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6395f1fec9ae436646c0ef0b6e2e0992c2e501f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,149,241,254,201,174,67,102,70,192,239,11,110,46,9,146,194,229,1,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
