This course is designed for developers who are already familiar with Java programming and want to learn what's available in this new release. I'll start by showing you how to install the newest version of the Java developer's kit, or JDK, and how to add Java 8 support to Eclipse. Then I'll take you on a tour of the most important new features, starting with Project Lambda.\n\nI'll describe how to use the new Stream API, and use parallel processing on multicore systems. And the new DateTime API that lets you streamline your code and make it more intuitive. And, I'll describe some lesser known new features, such as a new class for joining strings into lists. The features I'll describe in this course let you streamline your code, make it more maintainable, and in some cases, even make it run faster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b04b3a7b9194c88b16d0b178fa019214e977e433","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Java+SE+8+new+features+%5BTDM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b04b3a7b9194c88b16d0b178fa019214e977e433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,75,58,123,145,148,200,139,22,208,177,120,250,1,146,20,233,119,228,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
