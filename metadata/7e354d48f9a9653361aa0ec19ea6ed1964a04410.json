The lecture was titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Free Energy Secrets of Cold ElectricityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ . It detailed the story of Radiant Energy and its successful application by Edwin Gray in an over unity motor design which Gray debuted in 1973. The real detective work ( &amp; credit) in uncovering TeslaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discovery of Radiant energy came from author Gerry Vassilatos in his recent book, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Secrets of Cold War TechnologyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ without which Lindemann could not have solved the enigma of GrayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Radiant circuit design. This lecture delivered the goods. The secret of TeslaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Radiant Energy has finally been revealed in manifold detail and only awaits the industry of those who care to study and understand it. Part1 presents a general overview of TeslaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discovery and the political, intrigues that led to its subsequent suppression. Part 2 will detail the nuts and bolts of how Tesla produced Radiant Energy with block diagrams, schematics, and drawings from TeslaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original patents to illustrate all of the necessary elements and parameters required. Additional details on GrayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modern adaptation of TeslaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Radiant circuitry and a brief look at Eric Dollard, the only man to successfully recreate TeslaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Colorado Springs Magnifying transmitter and reproduce the pure steaming white rays of Radiant energy in 1986 exactly as described by Tesla in his Colorado journals.
