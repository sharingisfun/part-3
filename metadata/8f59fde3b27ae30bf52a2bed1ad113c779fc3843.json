It was recorded at Forge Studios in Oswestry, Shropshire  and Rockfield Studios near Monmouth  in Wales between 1992 and 1994. It went platinum in the UK and sold 1 million copies worldwide and was dedicated to Philip Hall, the band's publicist, who died of cancer in 1993. On cassette tape and vinyl record record format, it was released as a double album. The second album by the influential Manchester four-piece, it suffered greatly at the time from the sheer weight of expectation generated by both the 5Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ year gap between it and the band's eponymous debut, and the band's withdrawal from the live arena for 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ of those years. In addition, The Stone Roses made their return in a changed musical environment, with the UK newly-ensconced in Britpop with Blur and Oasis as the premier rock bands of the day. The album reached number 4 in the UK Album Chart. Second Coming features tribal rhythms, 1970s-style extended guitar riffs, funky rock/blues numbers with jazz elements and campfire style songs such as &quot;Your Star Will Shine&quot; and &quot;Tightrope&quot; that hint at the bands rural surroundings at the time (the band moved to Wales to make the album). As the line-up began to crumble, three singles (&quot;Love Spreads&quot;, &quot;Ten Storey Love Song&quot;, and &quot;Begging You&quot;) from the album were released in the UK.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Breaking Into Heaven\n[02] Driving South\n[03] Ten Storey Love Song\n[04] Daybreak\n[05] Your Star Will Shine\n[06] Straight To The Man\n[07] Begging You\n[08] Tightrope\n[09] Good Times\n[10] Tears\n[11] How Do You Sleep\n[12] Love Spreads\n[13] The Foz\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 01h:12m:49s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 176mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nUploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 05 December 1994\nRecord Company\t&gt; Geffen Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk \n        \t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stone_Roses \n        \t&gt; http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/lyrics \n        \t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/thestoneroses \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f59fde3b27ae30bf52a2bed1ad113c779fc3843","amp;dn":"%5B1994%5D+Second+Coming+-+The+Stone+Roses+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f59fde3b27ae30bf52a2bed1ad113c779fc3843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,89,253,227,178,122,227,11,245,42,43,237,26,209,19,199,121,252,56,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
