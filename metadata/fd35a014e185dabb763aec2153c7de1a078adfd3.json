Every document from this era is an essential title to own no matter how obscure or fragmentary (and for some of the shows all we have are frustrating fragments). \r\n\r\nThe tape ends with the house announcer asking for William Combis, because â€œyour wallet is up hereâ€.  The great thing about Zeppelin in the early years are the surprises and unique moments and riffs they pull out of their head and this concert is an excellent example of this.  It was hoped more tape was found for this release but unfortunately that isnâ€™t the case.\r\n \r\nOrlando is one of the outstanding, but frustratingly incomplete, recordings from one of Zeppelinâ€™s greatest tours.  It is a great recording to have for the collection, and this is a very good way to obtain the show.\r\n\r\nTracklists:\r\n\r\nak note: Intro and ending are both on each disk \r\n\r\nDisc 1 (68:52):  Introduction, Immigrant Song, Heartbreaker, Since Iâ€™ve Been Loving You, Dazed And Confused, Black Dog, Stairway To Heaven, Celebration Day, Thatâ€™s The Way,ending announcement\r\n\r\nDisc 2 (64:06): Introduction, ,Going To California, You Really Got Me â€œexcerptâ€, What Is And What Should Never Be, Moby Dick, Whole Lotta Love (Boogie Chillunâ€™, My Baby Left Me, Mess Oâ€™ Blues), organ solo, Thank You, ending announcement\r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\n\r\nJimmy Page\r\nRobert Plant\r\nJohn Paul Jones \r\nJohn Bonham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd35a014e185dabb763aec2153c7de1a078adfd3","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Florida+Sun+%28Live+2-CD%29+1971+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd35a014e185dabb763aec2153c7de1a078adfd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,53,160,20,225,133,218,187,118,58,236,33,83,199,222,26,7,138,223,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
