Burrell is matched with tenor \n\nsaxophonist Stanley Turrentine, bassist Major Holley, drummer Bill English, and Ray Barretto on conga for a blues-oriented date \n\nhighlighted by &quot;Chitlins Con Carne,&quot; &quot;Midnight Blue,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Blues,&quot; and the lone standard &quot;Gee Baby Ain't I Good to \n\nYou.&quot; ~ by Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nAs far as jazz guitar on Blue Note records goes, there are two names you must know: Grant Green and Kenny Burrell. And while \n\nGrant's discography for Blue Note is humungous, Kenny did much of his recording as a sideman. But the numbers are all \n\nirrelevant when you listen to this masterpiece -- seven tunes that reach deep, deep into the blues and achieve that wonderfully \n\nlazy, after hours groove. The performances are all classic, from the Latin groove of &quot;Chitlins con Carne&quot;, to the brisk swing of the \n\ntitle track, to the solo guitar of &quot;Soul Lament&quot;. Stanley Turrentine's soulful saxophone playing is among his finest, and the \n\nbass/drums/conga rhythm section is impeccable at setting up a groove. And the leader provides tasty guitar playing that mixes \n\nbebop lines and bluesy feeling perfectly. As far as hearing some classic jazz guitar, Midnight Blue and Grant Green's Idle \n\nMoments album are a perfect start. ~ Amazon. com\n\nPersonnel:\nKenny Burrell (Guitar) \nStanley Turrentine (Tenor Saxophone) \nMajor Holley Jr. (Double Bass) \nBill English (Drums) \nRay Barretto (Conga) \n\nTracks:\n01  Chitlins Con Carne (Kenny Burrell) 5:29 \n02  Mule (Major Holley/Kenny Burrell) 6:57 \n03  Soul Lament (Kenny Burrell) 2:43 \n04  Midnight Blue (Kenny Burrell) 4:00 \n05  Wavy Gravy (Kenny Burrell) 5:47 \n06  Gee Baby Ain't I Good to You (Andy Razaf/Don Redman) 4:25 \n07  Saturday Night Blues (Kenny Burrell) 6:16 \n08  Kenny's Sound (Kenny Burrell) 4:43 \n09  K Twist* (Kenny Burrell) 3:34 \n* Bonus track\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569b20a65b29555ef9857fe8cb11cb322b8a2d8f","amp;dn":"Kenny+Burrell+-+Midnight+Blue+%281963%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569b20a65b29555ef9857fe8cb11cb322b8a2d8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,155,32,166,91,41,85,94,249,133,127,232,203,17,203,50,43,138,45,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
