With the vast         \ncollection of ready-made presets, mixing music is not only easy and           \nincredibly fast -- you end up with results second to none.                    \n                                                                                \n All the previous functionality and content from EZmix is still intact and   \nworking in EZmix 2. The major difference however, is that the new and         \nrevamped version comes with settings based on high-tech mastering effects,    \nnew reverb algorithms, guitar/bass amp and cab simulation, a completely       \nrevised interface and a large core content boost. Essentially, EZmix 2 is a   \nmixing engineer, mastering suite and guitar/bass amp all rolled up into one   package.                                                                      \n                                                                                \nStart mixing -- it's EZ!\n\n\n1) Uninstall previous Versions\n\n2) Install\n\n3) Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf90d6613a9e0277b38decf9fd5856169f86d4db","amp;dn":"Toontrack+EZ+Mix+2+v2.0.0+UNLOCKED+x86+x64-ASSiGN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf90d6613a9e0277b38decf9fd5856169f86d4db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,144,214,97,58,158,2,119,179,141,236,249,253,88,86,22,159,134,212,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
