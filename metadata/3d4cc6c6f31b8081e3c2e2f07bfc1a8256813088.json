The glowing embers, the sizzle of a well - marbled rib eye as it hits a hot grill, the bracing slaws and perfectly charred kernels of sweet corn - Bon Appetit has always brought the delicious alchemy of grilling to life in the pages of the magazine.\n\nNow home cooks will discover their ideal grilling companion and coach in The Grilling Book. Offering more than 350 foolproof recipes, dozens of luscious full-color photographs, crystal clear illustrations, and plenty of plainspoken, here's-how-to-do-it guidelines, The Grilling Book welcomes you to everything that is sensational (and sensationally simple) about grilling.\n\nHere are thick, juicy steaks that need no more than salt and freshly cracked pepper to create an unforgettable meal; baby back ribs rendered succulent and fall-apart tender with flavor-rich rubs and a shellacking of barbecue sauce (plus the secret cheat method that makes them ridiculously easy to prepare); moist fish, seasoned and grilled quickly over a hot fire; irresistible grilled flatbreads, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, creating the perfect canvas for every topping you crave. Not to mention the salads, slaws, sides, and drinks that complete the perfect grilled meal.\n\nWhether you've been grilling for years or have never bought a bag of charcoal in your life, The Grilling Book is the only book you'll need in your backyard this summer - or any summer.\n\nAuthor:\n\nAdam Rapoport is Editor-in-Chief of Bon AppÃƒÂ©tit magazine and its website bonappetit.com.
