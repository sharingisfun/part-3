But his company, Stratton Oakmont, worked differently. His young Long Island wannabes didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know from turnaround plans or fiduciary trust. Instead, they knew how to separate wealthy investors from their cash, and spend it as fast as it came inÃ¢â‚¬â€on hookers, yachts, and drugs. But when JordanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s empire crashed, the man who had become legend was cornered into a five-year stint cooperating with the feds. This continuation of his Wall Street Journal bestseller, The Wolf of Wall Street, tells the true story of his spectacular flameout and imprisonment for stock fraud.\n\nIn this astounding account, Wall StreetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notorious bad boyÃ¢â‚¬â€and original million-dollar-a-month stock chopperÃ¢â‚¬â€leads us through a drama worthy of The Sopranos, from his early rise to power to the FBI raid on his estate to the endless indictments at his arrest, to his deal with a bloodthirsty prosecutor to rat out his oldest friends and colleaguesÃ¢â‚¬â€while they were doing the same. With his kingdom in ruin, not to mention his marriage, the Wolf faced his greatest challenge yet: how to navigate a gauntlet of judges and lawyers, hold on to his kids and his enraged model wifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and possibly salvage his self-respect. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to be easy. In fact, for a man with an unprecedented appetite for excess, it was going to be hell.\n\nFrom a wired conversation at an Italian restaurant, where JordanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conscience finally kicks in, to a helicopter ride with an underage knockout that will become his ultimate undoing, here is the tale of a young genius on a roller coaster of harrowing highsÃ¢â‚¬â€and more harrowing lows. But as the countdown to his moment in court begins, after one last crazy bout with a madcap Russian beauty queen, the man at the center of one of the most outrageous scandals in financial history sees the light of what matters most: his sobriety, and his future as a father and a man. Will a prison term be his first step toward redemption?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50460e54c423c363952e6e30924ba32f3070c026","amp;dn":"Catching+The+Wolf+of+Wall+Street+-+Jordan+Belfort.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50460e54c423c363952e6e30924ba32f3070c026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,70,14,84,196,35,195,99,149,46,110,48,146,75,163,47,48,112,192,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
