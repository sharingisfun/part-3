His magnum opus was a sequence of short stories and novels collectively entitled La ComÃƒÂ©die humaine, which presents a panorama of French life in the years after the 1815 fall of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nDue to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society, Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of realism in European literature. He is renowned for his multifaceted characters, who are morally ambiguous. His writing influenced many subsequent novelists such as Marcel Proust, Ãƒâ€°mile Zola, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, EÃƒÂ§a de QueirÃƒÂ³s, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Gustave Flaubert, Benito PÃƒÂ©rez GaldÃƒÂ³s, Marie Corelli, Henry James, William Faulkner, Jack Kerouac, and Italo Calvino, and philosophers such as Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. Many of Balzac's works have been made into or have inspired films, and they are a continuing source of inspiration for writers, filmmakers and critics.\n\nThe ComÃƒÂ©die Humaine remained unfinished at the time of his deathÃ¢â‚¬â€Balzac had plans to include numerous other books, most of which he never started. He frequently moved between works in progress, and &quot;finished&quot; works were often revised between editions. This piecemeal style is reflective of the author's own life, a possible attempt to stabilize it through fiction. &quot;The vanishing man&quot;, writes Pritchett, &quot;who must be pursued from the rue Cassini to ... Versailles, Ville d'Avray, Italy, and Vienna can construct a settled dwelling only in his work.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis comprehensive eBook presents the complete Human Comedy of HonorÃƒÂ© de Balzac in English, with beautiful illustrations, concise introductions and the usual Delphi bonus material. \n\n* Beautifully illustrated with images relating to Balzac's life and works\n\n* Concise introductions to the novels and other works\n\n* The COMPLETE Ã¢â‚¬ËœLa ComÃƒÂ©die humaineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in English translation\n\n* The whole series is precisely organised into Balzac's plan\n\n* Includes BalzacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s introduction AVANT-PROPOS\n\n* Images of how the books were first printed, giving your eReader a taste of the original texts\n\n* Famous works such as FATHER GORIOT, COUSIN BETTY, THE MAGIC SKIN and many more are illustrated with their original artwork\n\n* BalzacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five plays\n\n* Criticism section, with seven essays by writers such as Henry James and Leslie Stephen, evaluating BalzacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contribution to literature\n\n* Features five biographies - discover in depth Balzac's literary life!\n\n* Scholarly ordering of texts into chronological order and literary genres\n\n* Special CHARACTERS resource, with information on all members of the cast of Ã¢â‚¬ËœLa ComÃƒÂ©die humaineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with references to the novels and stories they appear in\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe torrent contains:\n\n*  Complete Works ofHonorÃƒÂ© de Balzac - HonorÃƒÂ© de Balzac -- ePUB\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead the article, and SEED the torrent.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85ccfe38b8069f4af2e7ae4f478d82a020671c9d","amp;dn":"Honore+de+Balzac+-+Complete+Works%2C+Delphi+Classics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85ccfe38b8069f4af2e7ae4f478d82a020671c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,204,254,56,184,6,159,74,242,231,174,79,71,141,130,160,32,103,28,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
