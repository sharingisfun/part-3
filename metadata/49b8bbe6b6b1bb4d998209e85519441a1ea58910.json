Now revised, enlarged and expanded, Kenneth Frampton brings the story up to date and adds an entirely new concluding chapter that focuses on four countries where individual talent and enlightened patronage have combined to produce a comprehensive and convincing architectural culture: Finland, France, Spain and Japan. The bibliography has also been reviewed and extended, making this volume more indispensable than ever. 362 illus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49b8bbe6b6b1bb4d998209e85519441a1ea58910","amp;dn":"Modern+Architecture-A+Critical+History%2C+3rd+ed+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49b8bbe6b6b1bb4d998209e85519441a1ea58910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,184,187,230,182,177,187,77,153,130,9,232,85,25,68,26,30,165,137,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
