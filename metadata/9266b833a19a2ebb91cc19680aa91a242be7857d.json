Instead, by using the following three simple, yet brilliant, techniques that make it just an incredible learning tool, this book shows you how to create your own photography workflow using Lightroom:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Throughout the book, Scott shares his own personal settings and studiotested techniques. Each year he trains thousands of Lightroom users at his live seminars and through that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned what really works, what doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and he tells you flat out which techniques work best, which to avoid, and why.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The entire book is laid out in a real workflow order with everything step by step, so you can begin using Lightroom like a pro from the start.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What really sets this book apart is the last chapter. This is where Scott dramatically answers his #1 most-asked Lightroom question, which is: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Exactly what order am I supposed to do things in, and where does Photoshop fit in?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entire start-to-finish Lightroom 5 workflow and learn how to incorporate it into your own workflow.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Plus, this book includes a downloadable collection of some of the hottest Lightroom Develop module presets to give you a bunch of amazing effects with just one click!\nScott knows first-hand the challenges todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s digital photographers are facing, and what they want to learn next to make their workflow faster, easier, and more fun. He has incorporated all of that into this major update for Lightroom 5.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the first and only book to bring the whole process together in such a clear, concise, and visual way. Plus, the book includes a special chapter on integrating Adobe Photoshop seamlessly right into your workflow, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn some of ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest Photoshop portrait retouching techniques and special effects, which take this book to a whole new level. There is no faster, more straight-to-the-point, or more fun way to learn Lightroom than with this groundbreaking book. \n\n\n\nBy Scott Kelby\nPublished by Peachpit Press in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 552 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9266b833a19a2ebb91cc19680aa91a242be7857d","amp;dn":"The+Adobe+Photoshop+Lightroom+5+Book+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9266b833a19a2ebb91cc19680aa91a242be7857d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,102,184,51,161,154,46,187,145,204,25,104,10,169,26,36,43,231,133,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
