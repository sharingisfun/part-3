On the lam from the police, Richard Todd takes refuge in the home of his former girlfriend, RADA student Jane Wyman. Todd has been spotted fleeing the scene of a murder, but he insists that he's innocent. Wyman believes his story, but knows that the police won't, so she decides to play detective herself. She also plays several other roles in a variety of disguises so as to escape the notice of genuine detective Michael Wilding. Top-billed Marlene Dietrich plays a Dietrich-like chanteuse whom Wyman pigeonholes as the real murderer. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042994/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042994/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1013&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1013&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\n\n\n        Jane Wyman\t ... \tEve Gill (aka Doris Tinsdale)\n\n\tMarlene Dietrich\t... \tCharlotte Inwood\n\tMichael Wilding\t... \tOrdinary Smith\n\tRichard Todd\t... \tJonathan Cooper\n\tAlastair Sim\t... \tCommodore Gill (as Alistair Sim)\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:45:27\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480   4:3\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1541 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,21 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much you D/L.\n\nThanks John","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d17376ba35c49d73a13f2b6fd39efd0bf27e1da","amp;dn":"Stage+Fright++%281950%29+Marlene+Dietrich+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d17376ba35c49d73a13f2b6fd39efd0bf27e1da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,23,55,107,163,92,73,215,58,19,242,182,253,57,239,208,191,39,225,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
