Conny Veit contributes electric guitar, but other than that, Fricke pulls the plug and builds the album around violin, tamboura, piano, oboe, cembalo, and Veit's 12-string, often with Korean soprano Djong Yun's haunting voice hovering above the arrangements. As the album's title suggests, Fricke conceived of Hosianna Mantra as a musical reconciliation of East and West, a harmonization of seemingly opposed terms, combining two devotional music traditions.\n\nJulian Cope has said that Hosianna Mantra sounds like it was made in a &quot;cosmic convalescent home&quot; - an excellent description underscoring the timeless, healing quality of this music, which is far removed from the everyday world and yet at one with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6d98673130d0ede1d92f3bf4404f0b8febbd3b","amp;dn":"Popol+Vuh+-+Hosianna+Mantra+1972+%2F+2004+Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6d98673130d0ede1d92f3bf4404f0b8febbd3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,109,152,103,49,48,208,237,225,217,47,59,244,64,79,11,143,235,189,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
