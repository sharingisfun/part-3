This stuff is absolutely great. In my collection of spiritual/philosophical media i got many 100 gigabytes of data and i can honestly say that Jack Kornfields stuff is kind of the crown jewels of it all. The first time i initially heard Kornfield i kind of wondered which kind of sedative medication he was on, but after a very short while his personality really makes more than perfect sense. Intelligent, interesting, wise, and a lot of humour. He often illustrates stuff with some tales or legends or with stories from real life which is great because he is a absolutely wonderful storyteller. \nKornfield has been trained as buddhist monk in Burma, Thailand and India for many years and later got a Ph.D in psychology. You do not at all have to be into buddhism to find this material highly interesting and valuable.\n\nTHIS TORRENT CONTAINS:\no The audiobook &quot;A Path with Heart&quot; read by Kornfield\no The lecture/speech &quot;The 10 Perfections&quot;, &quot;Dharma Talks- Compassion&quot;,and &quot;Working With The Heart in Troubled Times&quot;\no The ebook &quot;Eightfold Path For The Householder&quot; and a really good ebook by Kornfields teacher Ajahn Chah \no A short 3 minute video with Jack Kornfield.\n\nFor more stuff by Kornfield: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3408201/%5BAudioBook%5D_Kornfield__Jack_--_Roots_of_Buddhist_Psychology_(Sou&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3408201/%5BAudioBook%5D_Kornfield__Jack_--_Roots_of_Buddhist_Psychology_(Sou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3495688/Jack_Kornfield-Your_Buddha_Nature&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3495688/Jack_Kornfield-Your_Buddha_Nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3532806/Jack_Kornfield_-_The_Inner_Art_of_Meditation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3532806/Jack_Kornfield_-_The_Inner_Art_of_Meditation&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aff23ca02017ca9850c2dbdc4ccd03554b6dd1a","amp;dn":"Jack+Kornfield+-+Buddhism%2C+Psychology%2C+Meditation+and+Philosophy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aff23ca02017ca9850c2dbdc4ccd03554b6dd1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,255,35,202,2,1,124,169,133,12,45,189,196,204,208,53,84,182,221,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
