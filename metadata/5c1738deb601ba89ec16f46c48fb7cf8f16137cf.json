It was Rand's last work of fiction before concentrating her writings exclusively on philosophy, politics and cultural criticism. At over one thousand pages in length, she considered it her magnum opus.[1] Also, at approximately 645,000 words, Atlas Shrugged is one of the longest novels ever written in any European language. The book explores a number of philosophical themes that Rand would subsequently develop into the philosophy of Objectivism. According to a 1991 United States survey by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club, Atlas Shrugged was the book that made most difference in readers' lives after the Bible.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c1738deb601ba89ec16f46c48fb7cf8f16137cf","amp;dn":"Atlas+Shrugged+by+Ayn+Rand+-+PDF+-+velvetfog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c1738deb601ba89ec16f46c48fb7cf8f16137cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,23,56,222,182,1,186,137,236,22,244,108,72,251,124,248,241,97,55,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
