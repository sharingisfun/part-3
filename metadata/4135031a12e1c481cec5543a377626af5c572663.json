Take your skills out of the 20th century and into this one with Dan Clark's accessible, quick-paced guide to C# and object-oriented programming, completely updated for .NET 4.0 and C# 4.0.\n\nAs you develop techniques and best practices for coding in C#, one of the world's most popular contemporary languages, you'll experience modeling a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreal worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ application through a case study, allowing you to see how both C# and OOP (a methodology you can use with any number of languages) come together to make your code reusable, modern, and efficient.\n\nWith more than 30 fully hands-on activities, you'll discover how to transform a simple model of an application into a fully-functional C# project, including designing the user interface, implementing the business logic, and integrating with a relational database for data storage. Along the way, you will explore the .NET Framework, the creation of a Windows-based user interface, a web-based user interface, and service-oriented programming, all using Microsoft's industry-leading Visual Studio 2010, C#, Silverlight, the Entity Framework, and more.\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\nLearn to use the Universal Modeling Language (UML) to quickly design an application correctly from the first time\nUnderstand object-oriented programming principles and how they benefit your work in today's dual Web- and Windows-based world\nIntegrate OOP fundamentals when developing code in C#\nDiscover the .NET Framework and how it can help you create applications quickly and efficiently\nWalk along as the author develops a complete Windows- and Web-based application using the techniques and best practices covered inside\nWho this book is for\nIf you're a beginning C# programmer who wants to gain a foundation in object-oriented programming along with the C# language basics, this book is for you.\nProgrammers transitioning from a procedure-oriented programming model to an object-oriented model will also find many practical suggestions and walkthroughs inside.\nIn particular, Visual Basic developers who want to transition to C# programming, but lack a firm grasp of object-oriented programming principles, will find this book an excellent starting point for their journey into C#.\nThe book includes a primer in Appendix A that discusses some fundamental procedural programming concepts.\nTable of Contents\nOverview of Object-Oriented Programming\nDesigning OOP Solutions: Identifying the Class Structure\nDesigning OOP Solutions: Modeling the Object Interaction\nDesigning OOP Solutions: A Case Study\nIntroducing the .NET Framework and Visual Studio\nCreating Classes\nCreating Class Hierarchies\nImplementing Object Collaboration\nWorking with Collections\nImplementing the Data Access Layer\nDeveloping Windows Applications\nDeveloping Web Applications\nDeveloping and Consuming WCF Services\nDeveloping the OSO Application\nWrapping Up\nFundamental Programming Concepts\nException Handling in C#\nInstalling the Required Software","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4135031a12e1c481cec5543a377626af5c572663","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Beginning+C+Sharp+Object-Oriented+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4135031a12e1c481cec5543a377626af5c572663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,53,3,26,18,225,196,129,206,197,84,58,55,118,38,175,92,87,38,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
