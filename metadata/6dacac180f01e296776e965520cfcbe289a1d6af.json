The text begins with Wright's apprenticeship to Adler and Sullivan before the turn of the century, moves on to the prairie period, years spent in Japan and California, major designs of the late 1920s and 1930s, his Usonian homes, and finally his later works. The book also includes a look at Wright's prized collection of Asian art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dacac180f01e296776e965520cfcbe289a1d6af","amp;dn":"Frank+Lloyd+Wright+-+Americas+Master+Architect+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dacac180f01e296776e965520cfcbe289a1d6af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,172,172,24,15,1,226,150,119,110,150,85,32,207,203,226,137,161,214,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
