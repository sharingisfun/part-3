One big difference noticed by students of Yin Yoga is the long-held, passive nature of the posture, which gives time for a deeper journey to unfold, a journey into the meditative aspects of yoga, a bridge to living life mindfully.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c1e5a0e9af9e7733e915ff8bb6d9519332c5dd","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Guide+to+Yin+Yoga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4c1e5a0e9af9e7733e915ff8bb6d9519332c5dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,193,229,160,233,175,158,119,51,233,21,255,139,182,217,81,147,50,197,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
