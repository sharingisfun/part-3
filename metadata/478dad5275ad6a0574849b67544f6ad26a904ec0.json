The text follows an anatomic region approach, covering surface anatomy and muscle groups before presenting a comprehensive review of the most often presenting orthopedic dysfunctions or conditions. Each dysfunction or condition is reviewed with a consistent diagnostic checklist, a stepped treatment program, and relevant &quot;clinical pearls&quot;.
