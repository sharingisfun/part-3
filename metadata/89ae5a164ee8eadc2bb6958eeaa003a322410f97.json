Ellis's wit is bang on the job, surely at its prime, in all its spitfire, vulgar glory. And the nosedive the series takes somewhere in the middle comes with scary accuracy, becoming a soap box commentary on our generation. Touching everything from anthropomorphism to religion to politics with a cheery sense of dread and disgust in its 60 issue run, and featuring one of the scariest governments post-1984, this is one of Vertigo's imprint-defining titles.\n\nTrade Paperbacks:\n\n#01-06: Back on the Street\n#07-12: Lust for Life\n#13-18: Year of the Bastard\n#19-24: The New Scum\n#25-30: Lonely City\n#31-36: Gouge Away\n#37-42: Spider's Thrash\n#43-48: Dirge\n#49-54: The Cure\n#55-60: One More Time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89ae5a164ee8eadc2bb6958eeaa003a322410f97","amp;dn":"Transmetropolitan+%28v01+-+v10%29+%282009+-+2011%29+%28Digital+TPB%29+%28Empir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89ae5a164ee8eadc2bb6958eeaa003a322410f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,174,90,22,78,232,234,220,43,182,149,142,234,160,3,163,34,65,15,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
