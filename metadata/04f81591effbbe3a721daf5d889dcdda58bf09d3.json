Those names evoke saccharine cocktails and\nElvis in a yellow lei, and they paint a picture of a project defined by\nnostalgic yearningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all of which positions them squarely beside this yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\ntrendiest blooming summer record, Best CoastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Crazy For You. Except that Blue\nHawaii are resolutely not, despite what every contextual detail surrounding this\nrelease would suggest, a chillwave band. Because while Crazy For You shirks\nemotional responsibility as a protective measure against earnest vulnerability,\nemploying carefree summer imagery as a kind of coolly distant spectacle,\nBlooming Summer remembers the past fondly, even romantically, as an only\ntemporary reprieve from the pain of right now. Whereas Crazy For You is grounded\nin a shallow melancholy, in a vague hurt and longing for the past that amounts\nto little more than a wistful rut, Blooming SummerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s hurt seems rooted in\nsomething deeper. If this is chillwave, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chillwave reappropriated as a\nvehicle not for empty nostalgia but palpable heartbreakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a constant ache that\nseems amplified by how gorgeously itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being rendered.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something almost Lynchian about the approach: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pain, clear only on\nclose inspection, raging just beneath a veneer of too-perfect beauty. In Blue\nVelvet, and to an even greater degree in Twin Peaks, Lynch used the conventions\nof traditional Hollywood cinema and television to tap into a much deeper sort of\nemotional and psychological truth, and the results resonated more than a more\nstraight-forwardly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealisticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ approach would have. Here the blissful, carefree\nsummer stuff and the typical chillwave synth sounds that surround it serve a\nsimilar function: on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBelize,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Raph signs of side-by-side beach walking and\nfeeling great ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdelight,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but there are undertones of something less pleasant.\nWhen her final call of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdelightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ fades, engulfed by waves of reverb, a sharp\ndrum crack brings us out of it: that summer is over, Belize is many miles\ndistant, Montreal is getting cold.\n\nRaphÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals are nothing short of extraordinary. This is pained, moving stuff,\nbut a great deal of its resonance is owed to the delivery of lines which in less\ncapable hands might have fallen flat. Here things get Lynchian once again: like\nJulee Cruise, whose similarly ethereal singing can elevate already astounding\ntelevision to a state of dreamlike wonder, RaphÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice, at a few crucial\nmoments, connects with you in a way that you have to hear to believe. Blooming\nSummer steers clear of chillwaveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s go-to crutches like irony and cynicism\nanyway, but given the power of RaphÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think this could have been a\noff-handed trend project even if they wanted to sound distant and uncaring.\nAlbum opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLilacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounds great from the start, and RaphÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cries of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtrue\nloveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are nothing if not gorgeous, but only during the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last minute, when\nshe reaches unbelievable highs with the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin my headÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ do you realize Blue\nHawaiiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capacity for greatness. The world spins, the Giant talks, Donna cries,\nand we all just sit there stunned.\n\nThese elements could not come together more perfectly than on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue Gowns,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nBlooming SummerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s best track and the most heartbreaking song IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve heard this\nyear. Here Raph sings of poor decisions and wasted affection with a mixture of\nobscured jealousy and despairing regret, the combination of which her voice\nmakes sound more painful than a gunshot through the ribcage. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve all imagined\nex-lovers in the arms of new ones, but has there ever been a more eloquently\nugly description of the daydream than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI think about you thrusting into herÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½?\nAnd when she asks, without a wink, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhow stupid could we get?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, you can hear the\nscreamed cursing, the bleeding and broken-down insides, the regrettable finality\nof things, in her voice. Again, the beauty of this stuff on the surface, the\nperfect care with which this album was crafted, transmits more pain and hurt and\nanger and sadness than shitgaze or chillwave or anything else could have. You\ncan go to the beach, but your problems are going with you. How fucking sad is\nthat?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04f81591effbbe3a721daf5d889dcdda58bf09d3","amp;dn":"Blue+Hawaii-Blooming+Summer-2011-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04f81591effbbe3a721daf5d889dcdda58bf09d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,248,21,145,239,251,190,58,114,29,175,93,136,157,205,218,88,191,9,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
