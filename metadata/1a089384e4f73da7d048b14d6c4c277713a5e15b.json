Beginning with simple 2D sketching and the softwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sketch-editing tools, the course provides step-by-step instruction on building 3D geometry from 2D sketches. The course covers creating complex 3D objects with the Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, and Loft tools and shows building complex assemblies by mating individual parts together into robust assemblies and structures.\n\nThe course shows how to cut and revolve holes into parts and use the Hole Wizard tool to generate industry standard holes like counter bores, counter sinks, and taps. Best practice for designing parts is emphasized throughout the course as well as methods for creating parts faster and easier using equations, mirroring, and patterning tools. The course wraps up with generating manufacturing-ready drawings complete with an itemized Bill of Materials. As a bonus feature, Gabriel shows how to photo render a final design. Exercise files are included with the course.\nTopics include:\n\n    Starting a new sketch\n    Adding and removing relationships\n    Dimensioning a sketch for specific size attributes\n    Setting system options, units, and templates\n    Drawing polygons\n    Drawing circles, arcs, and splines\n    Creating offset geometry\n    Moving, copying, and rotating elements\n    Working with planes, axes, and the coordinate system\n    Using Revolve and Loft to create 3D objects\n    Trimming with the Revolve, Loft, and Sweep cuts\n    Creating smooth and angled corners with fillets and chamfers\n    Designing with sketch blocks\n    Working with subassemblies\n    Creating threaded parts\n    Integrating Excel to manage design tables\n    Adding dimension notations to a drawing\n    Rendering an image of a part or assembly\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a089384e4f73da7d048b14d6c4c277713a5e15b","amp;dn":"+-+SolidWorks+2012+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a089384e4f73da7d048b14d6c4c277713a5e15b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,8,147,132,228,247,61,167,208,72,177,77,108,76,39,119,19,165,225,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
