Where their contemporaries built on the legacy of Van Halen, Aerosmith, and Kiss, QueensrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿che constructed a progressive form of heavy metal that drew equally from the guitar pyrotechnics of post-Van Halen metal and '70s art rock, most notably Pink Floyd and Queen. After releasing a handful of ignored albums, the band began to break into the mainstream with the acclaimed 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime. Its follow-up, Empire, was the group's biggest success, selling over two million copies due to the hit single &quot;Silent Lucidity.&quot; QueensrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿che never sustained that widespread popularity -- like most late-'80s metal bands, their audience disappeared after the emergence of grunge. Nevertheless, they retained a large cult following well into the ensuing decades.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\t\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Queen Of The Reich\n02.The Lady Wore Black\n03.Warning\n04.Take Hold Of The Flame\n05.Walk In The Shadows\n06.I Dream In Infrared\n07.I Don't Believe In Love\n08.Eyes Of A Stranger\nCity Woman\n10.Empire\n11.Silent Lucidity\n12.I Am I\n13.Bridge\n14.Sign Of The Times\n15.Chasing Blue Sky\n16.Someone Else (With Full Band)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f042b7ef18f266f6b5f6d3e5592d7a6c5a6eccc","amp;dn":"Queensryche+-+Greatest+Hits+%282000%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f042b7ef18f266f6b5f6d3e5592d7a6c5a6eccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,4,43,126,241,143,38,111,107,95,109,62,85,146,215,166,197,166,236,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
