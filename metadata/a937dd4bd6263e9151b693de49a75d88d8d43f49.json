It is a selection of songs, which Rice says are Ã¢â‚¬Å“sung straight into the metaphorical mirror.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Intimate, frank and revitalized by making music again, My Favourite Faded Fantasy is a record that accepts oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faults but also begins, perhaps, to appreciate oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to grow up. The recording process began in Los Angeles and finished up with a cast of friends and local musicians against the stunning backdrop of Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\n\nTracklist:-\n\n01.
