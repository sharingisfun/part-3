The version here is the very rare Japanese Gold Disk version remastered by Kevin Gray (from Audio Fidelity), that made my other three CD versions of this album (especially an early Columbia version) sound dull, hissy and insipid. My 1970's LP pressing was close to this Gold Disk, but didn't quite match it. \r\n\r\nThe other albums include Night Rains, Stars, Billie's Bones, Hunger, Revenge, Live-Without a Net and Unreleased 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88689873d28e2e502f83c7bdab1b9d17504ca702","amp;dn":"Janis+Ian+Collection-10+albums+EAC+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88689873d28e2e502f83c7bdab1b9d17504ca702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,104,152,115,210,142,46,80,47,131,199,189,171,27,157,23,80,76,167,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
