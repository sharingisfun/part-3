In April of 1975, the North Vietnamese Army was closing in on Saigon as South Vietnamese resistance was crumbling. Approximately 5,000 Americans remained with roughly 24 hours to get out. Their South Vietnamese allies, co-workers, and friends faced certain imprisonment and possible death if they remained behind, yet there was no official evacuation plan in place. Still, over the last days in Vietnam, with the clock ticking and the city under fire, 135,000 South Vietnamese managed to escape with help from a number of heroic Americans who took matters into their own hands, engaging in unsanctioned and often makeshift operations in a desperate effort to save as many people as possible.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5119383639111d657f60&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 2591 Kbps (CRF 21)\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFramerate: 29.970 fps\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC (Nero)\nAudio Quality: 0.50 48KHz (~150 Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 1h 54mn\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.20 GiB\nContainer: MP4\nReleased: 2015\nSource: HDTV AVC 1080i\nCapper: KarMa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e08033bdfa2e89896b8f4b795fbcb0482e62eb02","amp;dn":"PBS.American.Experience.2015.Last.Days.in.Vietnam.720p.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e08033bdfa2e89896b8f4b795fbcb0482e62eb02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,128,51,189,250,46,137,137,107,143,75,121,95,188,176,72,46,98,235,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
