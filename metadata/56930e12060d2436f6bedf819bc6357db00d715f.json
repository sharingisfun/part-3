Over the years, Krippendorff has made important contributions to a host of fundamental issues concerning communication scholarship: theory, epistemology, critical scholarship, second-order cybernetics, the construction of reality through language, design, and meaning. On Communicating assembles Krippendorff's most influential writings-many of which are virtually unavailable today, appearing in journals, less accessible publications, conference proceedings, out-of-print book chapters, and articles in journals outside the communication field. In their totality, they provide a goldmine for communication students and scholars. Edited and with a critical introduction by Fernando Bermejo, this book introduces readers to Krippendorff's most important works.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/df81/19a26d149.png[/img]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56930e12060d2436f6bedf819bc6357db00d715f","amp;dn":"The+Elements+of+International+English+Style%3A+A+Guide+to+Writing+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56930e12060d2436f6bedf819bc6357db00d715f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,147,14,18,6,13,36,54,246,190,223,129,155,198,53,125,176,13,113,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
