Of course Turner's volcanic stage presence can't be fully translated onto disc, and the set list goes heavy on predictable covers like &quot;Sweet Soul Music,&quot; &quot;Honky Tonk Women,&quot; &quot;I've Been Loving You Too Long,&quot; &quot;Respect,&quot; and a ten-minute-plus &quot;Proud Mary.&quot; And the opening two numbers are sung not by Tina, but by the Ikettes.\n\nYou'd be a real sourpuss, though, to let your rock critic microscope keep you from enjoying this smoky set. Tina drains every last bit of emotion from the material, especially on the bluesy &quot;I Smell Trouble&quot; and the drawn-out covers of &quot;I've Been Loving You Too Long&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary,&quot; and the band offers a cookin' stew of R&amp;B-soul-rock, paced by Ike's reverberating guitar.\n\n\nRecorded Live At Carnegie Hall, New York on April 1, 1971.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Introduction\n02 - Piece Of My Heart\n03 - Everyday People\n04 - Introduction To Tina\n05 - Doin' The Tina Turner\n06 - Sweet Soul Music\n07 - Ooh Poo Pah Doo\n08 - Honky Tonk Women\n09 - A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Kinockin' Everyday)\n10 - Proud Mary\n11 - (Encore Of) Proud Mary\n12 - I Smell Trouble\n13 - Ike's Tune\n14 - I Want To Take You Higher\n15 - I've Been Loving You Too Long\n16 - Respect\n\n*2012 United Artists / BGO Records | BGOCD1062\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd102c8e6dd7abfb1ce6f50f9fb537ea88707a38","amp;dn":"Ike+%26amp%3B+Tina+Turner+-+What+You+Hear+Is+What+You+Get+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd102c8e6dd7abfb1ce6f50f9fb537ea88707a38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,16,44,142,109,215,171,251,28,230,245,15,159,181,55,234,136,112,122,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
