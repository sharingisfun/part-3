It is published by White Wolf, Inc and it uses the Storytelling System for rules. Changeling is the second limited game published by White Wolf after Promethean: The Created, but in April 2008 it was announced that because of the success of the line it would be an extended limited series not limited to 5 books.[1] Since then, three hardcover books were released. A PDF-only sourcebook, Goblin Markets, rounded out the line in the Fall of 2009. There are no plans for future official releases, but all Changeling titles remain in print and material may be included in other World of Darkness supplements.\n\nThe game is primarily inspired by tales of changelings from European folklore, but includes elements of similar stories from around the world. While superficially similar to the original World of Darkness game Changeling: The Dreaming, Changeling: The Lost approaches the legends from a more traditional perspective of mortals kidnapped by Fae, and eschews the heavily-reviled past life angle that characterized its predecessor.crossedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and a changeling doesn't always know which side of the threshold she stands on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f861810e6895ddb4051463408e5c6b3f03d36a9","amp;dn":"Changeling+the+Lost+RPG+-+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f861810e6895ddb4051463408e5c6b3f03d36a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,134,24,16,230,137,93,219,64,81,70,52,8,229,198,179,240,61,54,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
