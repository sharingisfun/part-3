Thermodynamics instructors need a concise textbook written for a one-semester undergraduate courseâ€”a text that foregoes clutter and unnecessary details but furnishes the essential facts and methods.\r\n\r\nThermodynamics for Engineers, Second Edition continues to fill both those needs. Paying special attention to the learning process, the author has developed a unique, practical guide to classical thermodynamics. His approach is remarkably cohesive. For example, he develops the same example through his presentation of the first law and both forms of the second lawâ€”entropy and exergy. He also unifies his treatments of the conservation of energy, the creation of entropy, and the destruction of availability by using a balance equation for each, thus emphasizing the commonality between the laws and allowing easier comprehension and use.\r\n\r\nThis Second Edition includes a new chapter on thermodynamic property relations and gives updated, expanded problem sets in every chapter. Accessible, practical, and cohesive, the text builds a solid foundation for advanced engineering studies and practice. It exposes students to the &quot;big picture&quot; of thermodynamics, and its streamlined presentation allows glimpses into important concepts and methods rarely offered by texts at this level.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s New in This Edition:\r\n\r\nUpdated and expanded problem sets\r\nNew chapter on thermodynamic property relations\r\nUpdated chapter on heat transfer\r\nElectronic figures available upon qualifying course adoption\r\nEnd-of-chapter poems to summarize engineering principles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcb322fdf5154d011d97d3d5f7dbcd2c0ec99376","amp;dn":"Thermodynamics+for+Engineers+2nd+ed+-+Kaufui+Vincent+Wong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcb322fdf5154d011d97d3d5f7dbcd2c0ec99376","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,179,34,253,245,21,77,1,29,151,211,213,247,219,205,44,14,201,147,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
