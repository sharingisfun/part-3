A mother and her teenage daughter are found murdered in a remote farmhouse, one defiled by multiple stab wounds and the other posed like Sleeping Beauty waiting for her prince. Ju O'Loughlin is drawn into the investigation when a former student, trading on Ju's reputation by calling himself the &quot;Mindhunter,&quot; jeopardizes the police inquiry by leaking details to the media and stirring up public anger. With no shortage of suspects and tempers beginning to fray, Ju discovers a link between these murders and a series of brutal attacks where the men and women are choked unconscious and the letter &quot;A&quot; is carved into their foreheads. As the case becomes ever more complex, nothing is quite what it seems and soon Ju's fate, and that of those closest to him, become intertwined with a merciless, unpredictable killer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c6413863e4115cda91b2ba35cb45d35bb322fcc","amp;dn":"CLOSE+YOUR+EYES+-+Michael+Robotham+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c6413863e4115cda91b2ba35cb45d35bb322fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,100,19,134,62,65,21,205,169,27,43,163,92,180,93,53,187,50,47,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
