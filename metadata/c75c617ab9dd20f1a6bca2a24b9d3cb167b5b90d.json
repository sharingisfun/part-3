It includes many of the ecstatically lyric poems first published in &quot;The Spice-Box of Earth&quot; (1961), as well as verses from &quot;Let Us Compare Mythologies&quot; (1956), &quot;Flowers for Hitler&quot; (1964), &quot;Parasites of Heaven&quot; (1966), and a number of new poems collected for the first time, many with strong social and religious overtones.\n\nIn his eloquent search for what he calls a &quot;state of grace&quot; -- the kind of balance with which one rises to the chaos around him -- Cohen eludes the restrictions of genres and generations.  Eclectic, searching, his voice is above all deeply personal.\n\nFor more works by Leonard Cohen, both poetry and fiction, please see http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9204309/  \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
