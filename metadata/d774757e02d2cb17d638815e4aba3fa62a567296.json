This release has no subs or extra languages.\n\nI also included the XBMC info and artwork scrapings from tmdb.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d774757e02d2cb17d638815e4aba3fa62a567296","amp;dn":"Totoro+1080p+%28Original+English+FOX+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d774757e02d2cb17d638815e4aba3fa62a567296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,116,117,126,2,210,203,23,214,56,129,94,74,186,63,166,42,86,114,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
