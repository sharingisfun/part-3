She died on Thursday at home in East Quogue, New York, her family said. \n\nSoundtracks \n\nAfter the success of Gloria, she also enjoyed chart hits with How Am I Supposed To Live Without You?\nand Solitaire in 1983, and Self Control the following year before her chart career faded. \nGloria was a remake of a 1970s Italian pop song, while How Am I Supposed To Live Without You?\nwas co-written with a then-unknown Michael Bolton. \n\nShe was first choice to sing All Time High, the title tune to James Bond movie Octopussy \nbut eventually lost out to Rita Coolidge. But she did contribute to film soundtracks \nincluding Flashdance and Ghostbusters and duetted with David Hasselhoff on the track \nI Believe for the Baywatch soundtrack in 1994. \n\nRave reviews \n\nAlthough she continued to release albums, her profile never returned to the level \nshe enjoyed in the early 1980s. Also an accomplished actress, her roles included \nTV show Chips and films Mugsy's Girl and Backstage. One of her last appearances was playing rock legend \nJanis Joplin to rave reviews in New York stage musical Love, Janis. \n\nBorn in Brewster, New York, Branigan had begun her career at the \nAcademy of Dramatic Arts and became a backing singer for Leonard Cohen before getting a solo record deal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa781478cf82cac3d48cbb1943f2faa7995a6b5","amp;dn":"Laura+Branigan+Her+25+Absolute+Best+Songs+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa781478cf82cac3d48cbb1943f2faa7995a6b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,167,129,71,140,248,44,172,61,72,203,177,148,63,47,170,121,149,166,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
