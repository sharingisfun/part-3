Once you and your canine pal have serious training (for obedience, basic good behavior, and so on) under the belt, you can take the edge off by injecting the whole training process with some fun tricks and games.\n\nTricks and games are open to dogs of all sizes, shapes, and ages. Every dog can learn to do something theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll enjoy. A Poodle, for example, can learn to dance. A retriever needs to fetch. Bichon Frises love their parlor tricks. Huskies want to pull a sled, herders love to herd, and so on. As for you, the dog owner, you  need to be sure your pooch knows whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in charge. You need to be the trainer, not the trained, before you and your dog can move on to tricks and games.\n\nDog Tricks For Dummies makes trick training fun for you and your dog. You can teach simple tricks, like wagging the tail on command, and more complex ones, like fetching a soda from the refrigerator. This handy guide also shows you how to\n# Use basic commands such as Sit, Stay, Down, and Go.\n# Teach good manners: Potty in one place, settle in one spot, pick up toys\n# Identify your dog's personality: Eager Beaver, Comedian, Bully, and more\n# Keep injuries at bay with a health plan\n# Teach jumps (and when not to jump)\n# Have fun in the snow: Sledding, skijoring, and tunneling\n# Go hiking, backpacking, or carting with your dog\n# Train your dog to run an agility course\n# Play Frisbee and flyball\n# Participate in pet therapy and at kids' parties\n\nSharing your life with a dog shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be a militaristic venture, selfishly designed around what you want your dog to do. Owning a dog is about joining two different species, two different spirits, in a way that will make the world better for both.\nFrom the Back Cover\nEasy-to-follow illustrations throughout\n\nThe quick and easy way to make trick training fun for you and your dog This fun and friendly guide shows you how to teach your dog tricks, from the simple (wagging his tail) to the extraordinary (fetching a soda from the refrigerator).
