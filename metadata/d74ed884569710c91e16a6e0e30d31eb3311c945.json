The entire show was broadcast live on Pay-Per-View and later partially released on CD and VHS. 22 years later, The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration is receiving a deluxe reissue on DVD/Blu-ray and a new CD from Columbia Records/Legacy Recordings.\nThe reissue will feature performances by the likes of Neil Young, Lou Reed, Eric Clapton, The Band, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, Pearl JamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready, Stevie Wonder, and what would be the last public performance by George Harrison. Every performer covers a Dylan classic, while the man himself appears for a few songs solo and with guests.\n\nA reissue of the concert has been in the works for years, but only recently was the rights red tape overcome. Ã¢â‚¬Å“[The footage] had been sitting in Japan at NHK,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an insider told Rolling Stone. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Japan was an early adopter in HD and they had HD cameras at the event. What youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re seeing now is their cut of the show, which nobody had ever seen before.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis footage includes a previously unreleased soundcheck recording of Sinead OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor covering Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Believe in YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and also her being heckled off the stage and into Kris KristoffersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arms after fighting through Ã¢â‚¬Å“WarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ConnorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infamous SNL appearance where she tore up a picture of the Pope had occurred just days before. But other parts of the show were left out of the reissue, like Neil YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Forever YoungÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, due to time constraints, and DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acoustic performance of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Song to WoodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“As frustrating at this sounds, his guitar wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recorded,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the source told Rolling Stone. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hearing is a faint guitar and BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice and we just couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d74ed884569710c91e16a6e0e30d31eb3311c945","amp;dn":"VA+-+Bob+Dylan+The+30th+Anniversary+Concert+Celebration+%5BDeluxe+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d74ed884569710c91e16a6e0e30d31eb3311c945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,78,216,132,86,151,16,201,30,22,166,224,227,13,49,235,51,17,201,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
