Stylistically, the band's music is a creative fusion influenced by free jazz, funk, hard rock and heavy metal. Their lyrics range from the personal to the political, in some of the latter cases attacking Eurocentrism and racism in America. The band were prominent members of the Black Rock Coalition during the late 1980s and early 1990s (a movement which also featured Fishbone and 24-7 Spyz). Living Colour rose to fame with their debut album Vivid in 1988. Although the band scored a number of hits, they are best remembered for their signature song &quot;Cult of Personality&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1989, and their highest charting single &quot;Type&quot;. They were also named Best New Artist at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. After disbanding in 1995,[1] Living Colour reunited in late 2000.\n\n.: Living Colour Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.heavyworlds.com/images/loghiconcerti/Living_Colour.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.heavyworlds.com/images/loghiconcerti/Living_Colour.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums &amp; TrackList :.\n\nVivid - 1988\nGenere: Hard Rock, Heavy Metal\n\n1.Cult of Personality\n2.I Want To Know\n3.Middle Man\n4.Desperate People\n5.Open Letter (To A Landlord)\n6.Funny Vibe\n7.Memories Can't Wait\n8.Broken Hearts\n9.Glamour Boys\n10.What's Your Favorite Color?
