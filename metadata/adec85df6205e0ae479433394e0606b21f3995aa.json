I downloaded the torrent off pirate bay before (but I lost the torrent and I wanted to reseed to share with everyone). I'm new to bittorrent... so Id appreciate if anyone could send me a message if it doesnt work and tell me what I might be doing wrong. The following songs are in this torrent: \n\n1. Brain of JFK\n2. Faithful\n3. No Way\n4. Given to fly\n5. Wish list\n6. Pilate\n7. Do the evolution\n8. Whales Untitled (dont think this one was on the real albume)\n9. MFC (many Fast cars)\n10. Lowlight\n11. In hiding\n12. Push me pull me\n13. All those yesterdays (radio rip)\n14. Bonus track \n\nMost of the songs are the orginals... but some are different or arent the real thing... though pretty much the same. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adec85df6205e0ae479433394e0606b21f3995aa","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+Yield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adec85df6205e0ae479433394e0606b21f3995aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,236,133,223,98,5,224,174,71,148,51,57,78,6,6,178,31,57,149,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
