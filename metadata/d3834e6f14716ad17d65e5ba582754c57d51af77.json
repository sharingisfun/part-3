When an impoverished man enters Rags to Riches - a consignment shop where Jennifer sells the gems sheÃ¢Â€â„¢s found at garage sales - and asks to have an item home-delivered, Jennifer agrees. Upon her arrival at his run-down apartment, Jennifer finds the man murdered. As the police survey the crime scene, Jennifer cannot help but think there is something familiar about the details of the killing â€“ and soon realizes that the victimÃ¢Â€â„¢s cold- blooded demise is a re-enactment of a murder in a classic mystery novel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3834e6f14716ad17d65e5ba582754c57d51af77","amp;dn":"Garage+Sale+Mystery+The+Novel+Murders+2016+720p+HDTV+X264+Solar+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3834e6f14716ad17d65e5ba582754c57d51af77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,131,78,111,20,113,106,209,125,101,229,186,88,39,84,197,125,81,175,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
