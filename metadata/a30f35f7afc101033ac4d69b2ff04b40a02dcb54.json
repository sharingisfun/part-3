Written by Ãƒâ€ neas MacKenzie and Wally Kline, the film is a highly fictionalized account of the life of General George Armstrong Custer, from the time he enters West Point military academy, through the American Civil War, and finally to his death at Little Big Horn. The battle against Chief Crazy Horse is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians and a corporation that wants the land Custer gave to the Indians. Despite its historical inaccuracies, the film was one of the top-grossing films of the year. They Died with Their Boots On was the eighth and final film collaboration between Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.\n\nLike Flynn's earlier film Sea Hawk, this film was digitally colorized in the early 1990s. This version was released on VHS tape in 1998.[2] Only the black-and-white version of this film has been released on DVD.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a30f35f7afc101033ac4d69b2ff04b40a02dcb54","amp;dn":"They+Died+With+Their+Boots+On+%5B1942%5D+Errol+Flynn+.x264+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a30f35f7afc101033ac4d69b2ff04b40a02dcb54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,15,53,247,175,193,1,3,58,196,214,155,47,240,75,64,160,45,203,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
