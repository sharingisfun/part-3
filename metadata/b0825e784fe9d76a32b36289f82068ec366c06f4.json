The style of drawing is very realistic, so much so you sometimes wish it wasn't. Also, the realistic style of drawing will appeal even to those not into manga. The type of horror you will see in his comics range from the absurd, the mind games and sometimes disgusting. However you will always be left feeling disturbed and ill at ease, sometimes without not knowing why.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=107&amp;pid=205#pid205&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=107&amp;pid=205#pid205&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0825e784fe9d76a32b36289f82068ec366c06f4","amp;dn":"Junji+Ito+Horror+Comics+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0825e784fe9d76a32b36289f82068ec366c06f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,130,94,120,79,233,215,106,50,179,98,137,248,32,104,236,54,108,6,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
