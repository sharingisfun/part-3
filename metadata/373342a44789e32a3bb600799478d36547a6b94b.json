On the other hand, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Process ViewerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tab gives you an overview over the running processes, along with process and session ID, threat information, company and description, memory, file size and date.\n\nEach process can be checked for threats online, but you can also terminate it, show the file in Explorer, view properties or open it with some user defined applications.\n\nSpyDLLRemover is indeed a handy tool and does its job very fast, scanning the system and letting you act accordingly in case some suspicious files are found on your computer.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s far from being a resource hog and it runs smoothly on all Windows versions, without even asking for administrator privileges when used on Windows 7.\n\nOverall, SpyDLLRemover is undoubtedly a very handy piece of software, running on low resources and providing advanced tools to detect any malicious file that may hide on your system.\n\n\nimage\n\n\n* Just Run to use...\n\n* Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:373342a44789e32a3bb600799478d36547a6b94b","amp;dn":"SpyDLL+Remover+v6.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"373342a44789e32a3bb600799478d36547a6b94b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,51,66,164,71,137,227,42,59,182,0,121,148,120,211,101,71,166,185,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
