The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.\r\nThe Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2d1ac6098a0f4a140781c77a3f23228b4685321","amp;dn":"Dead+by+Daylight+v1.1.2c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2d1ac6098a0f4a140781c77a3f23228b4685321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,209,172,96,152,160,244,161,64,120,28,119,163,242,50,40,180,104,83,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
