Billy decided to turn it into the police, but then... he saw the police man pocket the money for himself. Now, if ya'll see the police pocketing the money, putting the money in his pocket, whatchya'll gonna do?&quot;\nBoy 1: &quot;I rip that pig a new one!&quot;\nBoy 2: &quot;Karma will get him back... that's my lady's pimp. He wild.&quot;\nGirl 1: &quot;I do like Father Lee says and keep my mouth shut!&quot;\nGirl 2: &quot;I blame the liberal media!&quot;\nFlavor Flav: &quot;Hey, can I tell you guy's something?... Very good answers.&quot;\n\nDescription: The show's format is that of educational PBS children's television shows such as Sesame Street or The Electric Company (e.g. use of stock footage, puppetry, and clips of children being interviewed). However, Wonder Showzen parodies the format in a very adult-oriented manner. In addition to general controversial comedy, it satirizes politics, religion, war, sex, and culture with black comedy. Recurring skits include interviews with kids who give irreverent, controversial answers (a parody of similar segments on Sesame Street), kid reporters interviewing adults in a segment titled 'Beat Kids', and man-on-the-street interviews by the puppet Clarence (voiced by co-creator/writer Vernon Chatman). Clarence has a knack for harassing New Yorkers with innocent questions, such as chasing joggers and yelling &quot;I bet you've been running away from a lot of things all your life!&quot;, or asking people to repent in Christ before condemning them to hell. Every episode also features short animated cartoon segments, many of which are produced at Augenblick Studios.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_showzen\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450357/\n\nCreators: John Lee and Vernon Chatman.\nDirectors: John Lee and Vernon Chatman.\nWriters: John Lee and Vernon Chatman.\nStarring: Vernon Chatman, John Lee, Alyson Levy, Jim Tozzi, Evan Seligman, Ryan Simpkins, Trevor Heins, Scarlett Sperduto, Jon Glaser, David Cross, Chris Anderson, Tony Oliver, Raum-Aron, Jesus A.

Some wonderful stuff is coming up for this year.
