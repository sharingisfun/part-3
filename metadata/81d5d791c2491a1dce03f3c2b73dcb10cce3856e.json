Pink, the author of the bestselling A Whole New Mind, comes a paradigm-shattering look at what truly motivates us and how we can use that knowledge to work smarter and live better.\n\nMost of us believe that the best way to motivate ourselves and others is with external rewards like moneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the carrot-and-stick approach. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a mistake, Daniel H. Pink says in, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, his provocative and persuasive new book. The secret to high performance and satisfactionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½at work, at school, and at homeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.\n\nDrawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business doesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and how that affects every aspect of life. He demonstrates that while carrots and sticks worked successfully in the twentieth century, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s precisely the wrong way to motivate people for todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s challenges. In Drive, he examines the three elements of true motivationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½autonomy, mastery, and purposeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action. Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.\n\nDrive is bursting with big ideasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d5d791c2491a1dce03f3c2b73dcb10cce3856e","amp;dn":"Drive+-+The+Surprising+Science+of+Motivation.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81d5d791c2491a1dce03f3c2b73dcb10cce3856e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,213,215,145,194,73,26,29,206,3,243,194,183,61,203,16,204,227,133,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
