Players control one of four characters. They move through urban and science fiction environments, battling waves of oncoming enemies with weapons ranging from fists and bottles to knives, chairs and guns. The player can make some choices as to which territory to travel through.\nThe four characters have various reasons for taking on Dr. Zeng, a criminal mastermind with an army at his command. The action starts with a police cordon around Zeng's office skyscraper, moving to such locales as a shopping mall, subway and Coast Guard base before finally ending at the top of Zeng's island headquarters.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nThe player or players can choose from a selection of four characters. The playable characters are Hawk Manson (age 26), Mace Daniels (age 21), Ben &quot;Smasher&quot; Jackson (age 29), and Alana McKendricks (age 17). Hawk Manson and Mace Daniels are two all-around characters. Hawk is somewhat stronger than Mace who is in turn faster than Hawk. Ben &quot;Smasher&quot; Jackson is a large and slow bruiser capable of lifting and throwing the engines of cars at enemies. Alana McKendricks is a fast but soft-hitting teenager with an effective jump-kick.\nAll four characters have a special move that can be performed with the loss of a portion of health.\n------------------------------\n------------------------------\n------------------------------\n\nFIGHTING FORCE 2:\n\nOVERVIEW:\nSet in the not-too-distant future, human cloning has become a reality but has been banned by international treaty. The Knackmiche Corporation is suspected of researching cloning, and mercenary Hawk Manson is sent on a covert mission to investigate.\nIt features hand-to-hand and weapons combat like the original game but does not include multiplayer support. While it includes more weapons and larger levels than its predecessor, the sequel includes only one playable character this time around: Hawk Manson.\n\nMAIN CHARACTER BACKSTORY:\nHawk Manson was originally a freedom fighter against just about anything that you can think of; from drugs to crime, he fought against it. Eventually, Hawk lost interest in fighting wars that he had nothing to do with, and the nice guy image that he had built for himself was not rewarding enough for him. So he left the freedom fighters and became a lost soul.\nEventually he turned to crime to get money and make a living; and things were going well for him. After some time in his new-found lifestyle, he met Mace Daniels (featured character in Fighting Force) she was the light of his life. The two became close, but neither of them ever admitted to being more than friends.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52726f71ae258b19b15edd3ec294b21f8ee0e298","amp;dn":"Fighting+Force+1+and+2+%28PSX+Collection%29+%28PS1%29+%28Use+ePSXe%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52726f71ae258b19b15edd3ec294b21f8ee0e298","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,114,111,113,174,37,139,25,177,94,221,62,194,148,178,31,142,224,226,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
