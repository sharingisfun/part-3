Reclusive, the pair live with cats and raccoons in Grey Gardens, a crumbling mansion in East Hampton. Edith is dry and quick-witted - a singer, married but later separated, a member of high society. Edie is voluble, dresses - as she puts it - for combat in tight ensembles that include scarves wrapped around her head. There are hints that Edie came home 24 years before to be cared for rather than to care for her mother. The women address the camera, talking over each other, moving from the present to events years before. They're odd, with flinty affection for each other.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.NerdyJustin.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.NerdyJustin.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:128ef8fb305e531c413e4d3de4068e54cd68a3ec","amp;dn":"Grey+Gardens+1975","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"128ef8fb305e531c413e4d3de4068e54cd68a3ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,142,248,251,48,94,83,28,65,62,77,61,228,6,142,84,205,104,163,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
