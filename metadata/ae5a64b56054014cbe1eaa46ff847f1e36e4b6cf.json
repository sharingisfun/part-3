The band was in its prime, with vocalist Bon Scott leading the group through what would later be viewed as some of their strongest material, with the Young Brothers (Angus and Malcolm) driving the guitar-boogie riffs at full throttle.\r\n\r\nThe band had just released &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;, the album that would break the entertaining Aussie band worldwide, and was burning up the rock radio charts with a platter of classics that included &quot;Girl's Got Rhythm,&quot; &quot;Touch Too Much,&quot; and the title track.\r\n\r\nSadly, four months later, Bon Scott would drink himself to death and the band would be thrown into complete turmoil. But as we all know somehow Axl Rose would end up behind the mic for them much later...\r\n\r\nBut lets not jump ahead lets hear them almost 40 years ago. \r\nWhat? 37 years ago Oh man how did I get so old?\r\n\r\nWhen: 10/16/1979\r\n\r\nWhere : Towson, Maryland\r\n\r\nTime : 76:28\r\n\r\nSource : Soundboard\r\n\r\nQualitÃ© sonore : 9/10\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist :\r\n\r\n1.
