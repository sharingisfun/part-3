James. The first installment, Analord 10, went on sale through the Rephlex Records website on December 15, 2004, and was packaged in a leather binder with sleeves for housing the rest of the series. The record was marketed under James&amp;#039; primary alias &quot;Aphex Twin&quot;, although subsequent Analord recordings have so far been released under the &quot;AFX&quot; pseudonym.\n\nJames has programmed a variety of analogue equipment throughout his career. Instruments on Analord include drum machines such as the Roland TR-606, TR-808, and TR-909; sequencers such as the Roland MC-4; and various synthesizers and polysynths, including the Roland SH-101 and Roland TB-303, a Fenix Modular Synth (seen on the B-side of Analord 02), and countless others he has collected over the years or borrowed from colleagues.\n\nAnalord tracks are similar in atmosphere and melody to James&amp;#039; early acid and ambient techno recordings, yet are still marked by the fast, choppy, multi-layered drum sequencing he has perfected from the Richard D. James Album (1996) onward.\n\n\nThese are 12&quot; vinyl rips from a scene group.\nOriginal .nfo included. Added 0sec gap cue&amp;#039;s, md5&amp;#039;s and artwork from the web.\n\n\nTotal Size : 1 132 191 777 bytes\nDuration : 3:26:27.464 (546287168 samples)\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nChannels : 2\nBits Per Sample : 16\nAvg.
