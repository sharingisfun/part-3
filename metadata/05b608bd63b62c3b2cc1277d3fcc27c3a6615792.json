It tells the tale of three disaffected youths who plan a burglary, leading to deadly results. The alienated young trio is marvelous, particularly Anna Karina, and the early scenes of their clearly overdeveloped fantasy lives are splendidly handled. Something of a companion piece to Godard&amp;#039;s classic Ãƒâ‚¬ Bout de Souffle, its young characters have the same odd mixture of fatalism and starry-eyed naÃƒÂ¯vetÃƒÂ© that is, by turns, appealing and tragic. Trivia buffs should note that the film gave its name to Quentin Tarantino&amp;#039;s production company (A Band Apart), and several of its scenes are echoed in his Pulp Fiction.\n    Bande ÃƒÂ  part is the story of three alienated French youths (Odile, Arthur, and Franz) who attempt an ill-fated burglary. Bande ÃƒÂ  Part is one of the easiest Godard films to follow because its story is presented linearly and without disruptive montage. Although the film does not generate much narrative tension, it does capture the atmosphere among Odile, Arthur, and Franz. Bande ÃƒÂ  part contains two of the most memorable and exciting scenes of the French New Wave: a scene in which Odile, Arthur, and Franz run through a museum, and a scene in which they dance to a jukebox in a cafe. The dance scene has been borrowed in many films, including Rainer Werner Fassbinder&amp;#039;s Rio Das Mortes and Hal Hartley&amp;#039;s Simple Men. Bande ÃƒÂ  part is driven by its actors and the chemistry among them. It uses their interactions to document the feeling of being young and French in the early 1960s.\n\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
