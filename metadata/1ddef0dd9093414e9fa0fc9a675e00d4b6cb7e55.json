This image was submitted by  Stevie Keen. In the Suggest an Episode section you can send us any photo youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to see edited here in an episode. Let us know what you would like to see done!\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Covered\nFirst IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start off with curves to  slightly darken the highlight areas. Using Apply Image with a layer mask will make this layer more visible in the lighter areas, fixing any exposure problems. Next IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use a custom brush to add in more fog. This looks the most natural when its built up slowly in layers. Using a darker color and then lighter on top will make it look realistic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ddef0dd9093414e9fa0fc9a675e00d4b6cb7e55","amp;dn":"Phlearn+-+Tips+to+Add+Atmosphere+in+Your+Images","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ddef0dd9093414e9fa0fc9a675e00d4b6cb7e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,222,240,221,144,147,65,78,159,160,252,154,103,94,0,212,182,203,126,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
