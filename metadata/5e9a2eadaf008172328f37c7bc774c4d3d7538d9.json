Released in conjunction with a 150 page book, this record and it were meant to be experienced concurrently. When done so, this album goes from depressing to devastating, and from frightening to terrifying. &quot;Giles Corey&quot; is an incredible, incredible release from Dan Barrett, of Have A Nice Life.\n\nThe album contains everything from spirit recordings and &quot;spectral choirs&quot;, to slow, beautiful acoustic love songs, to a recording of the musician himself wearing a &quot;Voor's Head Device&quot; nearly suffocating as he's slamming his hands on his piano, screaming in terror. \n\nTrack Listing\n01. The Haunting Presence\n02. Blackest Bile\n03. Grave Filled With Books\n04. Empty Churches\n05. I'm Going To Do It\n06. Spectral Bride\n07. No One Is Ever Going To Want Me\n08. A Sleeping Heart\n09. Buried Above Ground\n\nEnjoy the music, and remember to support the artist if you're able to!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e9a2eadaf008172328f37c7bc774c4d3d7538d9","amp;dn":"Giles+Corey+-+Self+Titled+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e9a2eadaf008172328f37c7bc774c4d3d7538d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,154,46,173,175,0,129,114,50,143,55,199,188,119,76,77,61,117,56,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
