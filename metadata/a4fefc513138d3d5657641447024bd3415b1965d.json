Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office.\n\nThen John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.\n\nYou may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.\n\nThe Silkworm (#2): Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from Robert Galbraith, author of the #1 international bestseller The Cuckoo's Calling.\n\nWhen novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few daysÃ¢â‚¬â€as he has done beforeÃ¢â‚¬â€and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.\n\nBut as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were to be published, it would ruin livesÃ¢â‚¬â€meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.\n\nWhen Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before...\n\nA compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn, THE SILKWORM is the second in the highly acclaimed series featuring Cormoran Strike and his determined young assistant, Robin Ellacott.\n\nFull US Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4fefc513138d3d5657641447024bd3415b1965d","amp;dn":"Cormoran+Strike+series+by+Robert+Galbraith+%28US+Retail+ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4fefc513138d3d5657641447024bd3415b1965d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,254,252,81,49,56,211,213,101,118,65,68,112,36,189,52,21,177,150,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
