She found that navigating the basics of everyday lifeâ€”from buying a cell phone and filing taxes to education and childcareâ€”was much more complicated and stressful than anything she encountered in her homeland. At first, she attributed her crippling anxiety to the difficulty of adapting to a freewheeling new culture. But as she got to know Americans better, she discovered they shared her deep apprehension. To understand why life is so different in the U.S. and Finland, Partanen began to look closely at both.\r\n\r\nIn The Nordic Theory of Everything, Partanen compares and contrasts life in the United States with life in the Nordic region, focusing on four key relationshipsâ€”parents and children, men and women, employees and employers, and government and citizens. She debunks criticism that Nordic countries are socialist â€œnanny states,â€ revealing instead that it is we Americans who are far more enmeshed in unhealthy dependencies than we realize. As Partanen explains step by step, the Nordic approach allows citizens to enjoy more individual freedom and independence than we do.\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f3ec90b58efabc6d6c44d69a14aaed26a4668d","amp;dn":"The+Nordic+Theory+of+Everything+In+Search+of+a+Better+Life+%28Anu+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f3ec90b58efabc6d6c44d69a14aaed26a4668d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,243,236,144,181,142,250,188,109,108,68,214,154,20,170,237,38,164,102,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
