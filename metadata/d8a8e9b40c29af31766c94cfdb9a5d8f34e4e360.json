And yet it's evident that the vast majority of modern websites are of a graphical nature. We believe you should have complete freedom to include anything - text, graphics, photos - anywhere on the page, using just one tool. And you shouldn't need to know, or even see, the HTML that goes into creating your site, any more than a car driver needs to know how an engine works\n\nThere is no easier solution\nThe Web Designer approach is simple: Pick your design from the templates; customize it with complete freedom; publish. Absolutely no HTML or javascript skills are required!\n\nOne tool solution\nYou only need one program for creating graphical websites - from design to publishing - and that's Web Designer.\nWeb Designer includes customizable template designs plus tools for creating your own vector graphics and animations, for photo editing (an integrated ultra-fast, non-destructive photo tool), and for advanced text layout. Site upload is covered too!\n\nTotal design freedom\nWeb Designer gives you total design freedom - using drag and drop you can literally place anything, anywhere on the page. And things which are normally difficult to achieve in HTML are a snap in Web Designer - for example text with curved edges, text or graphics at an angle, text flowing around objects - no problem!\n\nWYSIWYG\nWhether you customize one of the bundled templates or create your own graphics or animations, it's genuinely WYSIWYG - what you see in Web Designer is exactly what you get on your website.\n\nQuality results guaranteed\nWeb Designer's templates are created by top professional designers, so the quality is guaranteed. But of course you can customize the color, text, images, size etc to create your own personal look without any loss of quality. It's the best of both worlds!\n\nClever stuff\nBut we have some clever tricks too, to make things easier for you - here's just a few of the things that will save you time and trouble:\nLiquid text flow around objects; easy mouseover, thumbnail and pop-up creation; automatic adjustment of photos to the correct web resolution; one-click change of site wide theme colors and shades; automatic color matching of imported objects such as buttons; and buttons and text panels that automatically stretch as you change the text.\n\nCompatibility\nWorking with industry standards is vital, so Web Designer sites are W3C compliant, cross browser compatible (IE 5.5, Firefox, Safari, Chrome) and XHTML, CSS standards based.\nIt can also import a huge range of files types for vector graphics, image and text including PDF, RTF, RAW, PSD, TIFF and of course JPEG, PNG, GIF.\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8. Intel Celeron or newer, or AMD Sempron or newer, plus:\nPhoto &amp; Graphic Designer, Designer Pro, Web Designer, Web Designer Premium 500MB RAM, 300MB hard disc space\n\nHomepage: http://www.xara.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.

Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a8e9b40c29af31766c94cfdb9a5d8f34e4e360","amp;dn":"Xara+Web+Designer+Premium+v9.0.2+x64+Cracked-F4CG+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a8e9b40c29af31766c94cfdb9a5d8f34e4e360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,168,233,180,12,41,175,49,118,108,148,207,219,154,93,143,52,228,227,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
