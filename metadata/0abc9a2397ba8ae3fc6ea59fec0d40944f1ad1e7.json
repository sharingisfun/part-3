As one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a portrayal of the Bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces at the behest of the Spanish nationalist government during the Spanish Civil War","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0abc9a2397ba8ae3fc6ea59fec0d40944f1ad1e7","amp;dn":"Pablo+Picasso++1881-1973+%28Taschen+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0abc9a2397ba8ae3fc6ea59fec0d40944f1ad1e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,188,154,35,151,186,138,227,252,110,165,159,236,13,64,148,79,26,209,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
