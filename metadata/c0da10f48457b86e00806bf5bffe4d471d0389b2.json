Charriere - nicknamed Papillon because of his \r\nbutterfly tattoo - and Louis Dega are two among many who have been convicted \r\nin the French judicial system, they now being transferred to French Guyana \r\nwhere they will serve their time, never to return to France even if they \r\nare ever released. A safe-cracker by criminal profession, Papillon is \r\nserving a life sentence for murdering a pimp, a crime for which he adamantly \r\nstates he was framed. Dega is a wealthy counterfeiter, who expects his \r\nwell-to-do wife eventually to get him released. On Papillon's initiative, \r\nPapillon and Dega enter into a business arrangement: Papillon will provide \r\nprotection for Dega, while Dega will finance Papillon's escape attempt. As \r\nPapillon and Degas' time together lasts longer than either expects, their \r\nburgeoning friendship ends up being an important factor altering their \r\noriginal plans, needed as they work with and against others who are trying \r\nto achieve their own goals, sometime conflicting with Papillon and Dega's.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Steve McQueen.\r\n=&gt;-Dustin Hoffman.\r\n=&gt;-Victor Jory.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Franklin J Schaffner.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Biography : Crime : Drama.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1973.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English : Spanish.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 2.38 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 257 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 30mn.\r\n=&gt;-Papillon 1973..............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/papillon/\r\n=&gt;-Papillon 1973..............: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/papillon-1973/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1 920 x 800.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2 010 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 273 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio Espanol.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 146 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English.\r\n=&gt;-Espanol","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0da10f48457b86e00806bf5bffe4d471d0389b2","amp;dn":"Papillon+-+Steve+McQueen+Dustin+Hoffman+Crime+1973+Eng+Spa+Multi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0da10f48457b86e00806bf5bffe4d471d0389b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,218,16,244,132,87,184,110,0,128,107,245,191,254,77,71,29,3,137,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
