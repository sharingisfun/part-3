Maybe someone will need it, just like my friend, so I decided to share it with you. According to the producer: IBMÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® LotusÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Organizer 6.1 is an electronic day planner with tabs for each section and pages that turn. You can quickly see all your calendar, contacts, to do&amp;#039;s, calls, notes, Web information and more at a glance. No more looking for sticky-note reminders or lost scraps of paper. It&amp;#039;s all there, right before your eyes.\n\nPerfectly works with Windows 2000 SP4 and XP SP3. I do not know about Vista, you have to check by yourself.\n\nCaution: The installer contains a bug. If you have many HDDs/partitions the program will install by default on the latest one, so choose manual installation and choose C:. If you have only one partition or HDD the default installation is OK for you.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Organizer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Organizer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/organizer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/organizer&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81846e0acc85c67dd705253368496cfdc99c44cc","amp;dn":"IBM+Lotus+Organizer+6.1+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81846e0acc85c67dd705253368496cfdc99c44cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,132,110,10,204,133,198,125,215,5,37,51,104,73,108,253,201,156,68,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
