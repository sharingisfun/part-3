Their new 40th anniversary compilation, &quot;A Thousand Thoughts,&quot; takes a well-earned victory lap by bringing together a generous helping of these globe-trotting musical excursions on a single disc.\n\nThe album would be worth checking out just for the spectacular roster of guest stars the quartet has brought into the studio over the years. One of the most popular singers on Earth, the legendary Asha Bhosle, lends her astonishingly pure and controlled vocals to a tune by her husband, film composer R.D. Burman.\n\nThe striking voices of the Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Vocal Choir, a.k.a. Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares, sing a piece written for them and Kronos by none other than Terry Riley. Argentinian master Astor Piazzolla plays the accordion-like bandoneon in a recording of a tango that he, too, composed expressly for the quartet. A collaboration with one of these names could be the crowning achievement of a musician's career; Kronos has racked up enough such crowns to fill a trophy room.\n\nBut just as impressive as these stellar cameos is the chameleonic playing of the quartet themselves, who manage to blend themselves into musics from Afghanistan, Vietnam and Austin, Texas, even while the core of their sound remains as warm and steady as ever.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nonesuch.com/albums/a-thousand-thoughts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nonesuch.com/albums/a-thousand-thoughts&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tusen Tankar\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ La Sidounak Sayyada\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Luu Thuy Truong\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Aha Gedawo\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ An Buachaillin Ban\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Round Sun and Crescent Moon in the Sky\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Evic Taksim\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rangin Kaman (excerpt)\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Smyrneiko Minore\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cry of a Lady\n12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sim Sholom\n13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mera Kuchh Saaman\n14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Asleep (from Five Tango Sensations)\n15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Danny Boy\n\n(with album scans)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7374eb96d9aff0b2b8072eb6e3937a7dae261cd1","amp;dn":"Kronos+Quartet+-+A+Thousand+Thoughts+%282014%29+mp3+%40+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7374eb96d9aff0b2b8072eb6e3937a7dae261cd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,116,235,150,217,175,240,178,184,7,46,182,227,147,122,125,174,38,28,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
