The six volume set of Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering illustrates how this field has been the key to enabling technology responsible for the phenomenal growth of wireless communications. This set also examines how RF and microwave engineering continues to have great influence as the technology behind such important applications as radar, remote sensing, remote control, sensors, navigation, surveillance, electronic warfare, radiometers, plasma research, and imaging.\nPrize or Award\n\nAAP Awards for Excellence in Professional and Scholarly Publishing, 2006\n\n\nimage\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\nimage\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b41f203fc3ac789750dab469553ac6eb31507798","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Rf+and+Microwave+Engineering+6+VOL+PDF+-+sum1_he","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b41f203fc3ac789750dab469553ac6eb31507798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,31,32,63,195,172,120,151,80,218,180,105,85,58,198,235,49,80,119,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
