It is home to an enigmatic machinelike structure called the Blood Spire, which has already brutally and systematically claimed the lives of one starship crew that attempted to uncover its secrets. But nothing will deter Richard Swift from exploring this object of alien origin.\n\nTurquoise Days\n\nIn the seas of Turquoise live the Pattern Jugglers, the amorphous, aquatic organisms capable of preserving the memories of any human swimmer who joins their collective consciousness. Naqi Okpik devoted her life to studying these creatures - and paid a high price for swimming among them. Now she may be the only hope for the survival of the species - and of every person living on Turquoise.\n\n---\n\n\n\nRead by John Lee\nFormat: M4B\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\nLength: 6 hrs and 58 mins\nSeries: Revelation Space, Book 6\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:08-04-15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b88815ed3a071bf73fd855b383f6af4700825d","amp;dn":"Alastair+Reynolds+-+Diamond+Dogs%2C+Turquoise+Days+%28Revelation+Spa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b88815ed3a071bf73fd855b383f6af4700825d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,184,136,21,237,58,7,27,247,63,216,85,179,131,246,175,71,0,130,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
