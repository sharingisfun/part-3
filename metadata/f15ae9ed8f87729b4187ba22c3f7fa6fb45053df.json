He also wants to fall in love one more time before he dies. MAY I BE FRANK documents FrankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transformation as he stumbles into the aptly-named vegan CafÃƒÂ© Gratitude, and, over 42 days, begins a life-changing journey during which he is coached physically, emotionally and spiritually by three twenty-something staff members on the path to enlightenment. Challenged by years of addiction, fatigue, and family dysfunction, FrankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest for a healthier lifestyle is both tense and touching. Through FrankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s metamorphosis, we witness the powerful effects of change upon one personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, and the potential we all have to find the most important love of allÃ¢â‚¬â€œlove of ourselves. \n\nBuy the DVD with Bonus Material at:\nwww.MayIBeFrankMovie.com\n\nTrailer:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f15ae9ed8f87729b4187ba22c3f7fa6fb45053df","amp;dn":"May+I+Be+Frank+-+A+Film+About+Sex%2C+Drugs+%26amp%3B+Transformation+DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f15ae9ed8f87729b4187ba22c3f7fa6fb45053df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,90,233,237,143,135,114,155,65,135,186,34,195,247,250,111,180,80,83,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
