The band released their second album on November 17, 2008.Traced in Air was released through French label Season of Mist, followed up by an EP titled Re-Traced on May 18, 2010.\n\nCynic's first recordings feature a more punk, thrash and hardcore sound, but in the 1990s their sound changed towards a highly complex, experimental and extremely technical form of progressive metal, while still retaining their death metal roots. Many influences from jazz and jazz-rock fusion can be heard on their debut album Focus. Focus has both &quot;growls&quot; and &quot;robotic&quot; vocals, using a vocoder. The offshoot Portal later released a demo recording that continues even further in the direction of progressive space rock, refining and softening up their sound.\n\nDiscography:\nFocus (1993)\nTraced in Air (2008)\nRe-Traced EP (2010)\nCarbon-Based Anatomy EP (2011)\nThe Portal Tapes (2012)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bd72d1b9f5a2ca7615a071c179ac2d37020a627","amp;dn":"Cynic+-+Discography+-+Lossless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bd72d1b9f5a2ca7615a071c179ac2d37020a627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,215,45,27,159,90,44,167,97,90,7,28,23,154,194,211,112,32,166,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
