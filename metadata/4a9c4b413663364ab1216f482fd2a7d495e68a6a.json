Two versions were released; a single disc version and a second version with a bonus disc. On the front cover, the album title is imposed upon the seal of the demon Astaroth.\n\nDisc 1 is a selection of songs from his previous solo albums, with the addition of two new songs, &quot;Broken&quot; and &quot;Silver Wings&quot;, both of which were written by Dickinson and guitarist/producer Roy Z. Disc 2 contains rare songs, most of which have appeared as b-sides on singles. The track &quot;The Voice of Crube&quot; is an explanation of the various songs, narrated by Bruce (for whom 'Crube' is an anagram).\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n&quot;Broken&quot; (Dickinson, Z) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00 \n&quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot; (Dickinson, Gers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25 \n&quot;Laughing in the Hiding Bush&quot; [live] (Dickinson, Dickson, Z) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09 \n&quot;Tears of the Dragon&quot; (Dickinson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:19 \n&quot;The Tower&quot; (Dickinson, Z) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43 \n&quot;Born in 58&quot; (Dickinson, Gers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36 \n&quot;Accident of Birth&quot; (Dickinson, Z) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 \n&quot;Silver Wings&quot; (Dickinson, Z) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16 \n&quot;Darkside of Aquarius&quot; (Dickinson, Z) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:50 \n&quot;Chemical Wedding&quot; (Dickinson, Z) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 \n&quot;Back from the Edge&quot; (Dickinson, Dickson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16 \n&quot;Road to Hell&quot; (Dickinson, Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58 \n&quot;Book of Thel&quot; [live] (Casillas, Dickinson, Z) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:27 \n\nDisc 2\n\n&quot;Bring Your Daughter...
