During her adventures we also get to meet her talking backpack (or la mochila) and the map who sings an annoyingly cute song. The show plays out almost like a computer adventure showing a mouse on different scenes where the kids make a decision. Dora asks your kids questions and then waits for a response. The main purpose of the show is to teach Spanish to English-speaking children.\n\nFormat : AVI at 2335 Kbps\nLength : 435 MiB for 26mn 1s 161ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 2196 Kbps\nAspect : 640 x 480 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f20ad746318d3673e99a4db72cc9e7d962c611d2","amp;dn":"Dora+the+Explolrer+%26Nu%3B%26omicron%3B+2.greek+audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f20ad746318d3673e99a4db72cc9e7d962c611d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,10,215,70,49,141,54,115,233,154,77,183,44,201,231,217,98,198,17,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
