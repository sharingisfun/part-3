They return to the MaddAddamite cob house, newly fortified against man and giant pigoon alike. Accompanying them are the Crakers, the gentle, quasi-human species engineered by the brilliant but deceased Crake. Their reluctant prophet, Snowman-the-Jimmy, is recovering from a debilitating fever, so it's left to Toby to preach the Craker theology, with Crake as Creator. She must also deal with cultural misunderstandings, terrible coffee, and her jealousy over her lover, Zeb. \n\nZeb has been searching for Adam One, founder of the God's Gardeners, the pacifist green religion from which Zeb broke years ago to lead the MaddAddamites in active resistance against the destructive CorpSeCorps. But now, under threat of a Painballer attack, the MaddAddamites must fight back with the aid of their newfound allies, some of whom have four trotters. At the center of MaddAddam is the story of Zeb's dark and twisted past, which contains a lost brother, a hidden murder, a bear, and a bizarre act of revenge. \n\nCombining adventure, humor, romance, superb storytelling, and an imagination at once dazzlingly inventive and grounded in a recognizable world, MaddAddam is vintage Margaret AtwoodÃ¢â‚¬â€a moving and dramatic conclusion to her internationally celebrated dystopian trilogy.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Random House Audio; Unabridged edition (September 3, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 073938399X\nISBN-13: 978-0739383995\n\nBernadette Dunne (Reader) , Bob Walter (Reader) , Robbie Daymond (Reader)\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
