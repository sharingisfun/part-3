It has unique capabilities to assess the performance of the processor, system memory, and disk drives.\n\nAIDA64 implements a set of 64-bit benchmarks to measure how fast the computer performs various data processing tasks and mathematical calculations. Memory and cache benchmarks are available to analyze system RAM bandwidth and latency. Processor benchmarks utilize MMX, 3DNow! and SSE instructions, and scale up to 32 processor cores. For legacy processors all benchmarks are available in 32-bit version as well. AIDA64 Disk Benchmark determines the data transfer speed of hard disk drives, solid-state drives, optical drives, and flash memory based devices.\n\nAIDA64 supports over 150 various sensor devices to measure temperatures, voltages, fan speeds, and power draw. Measured values can be displayed on System Tray icons, OSD panel, Sidebar Gadget, and Logitech G15/G19 Gaming Keyboard LCD. The values can also be logged to file or exported to external applications such as RivaTuner or Samurai. AIDA64 can also alarm the user when it detects overheating, over-voltage, or cooling fan failure.\n\n\nFeatures:\nGeneric features:\n-Low-level hardware information: 47 pages\n-Software and operating system information: 45 pages\n-Security related information: 6 pages\n-DirectX information including Direct3D acceleration features\n-Diagnostics module that simplifies troubleshooting\n-Tweaking features\n-Automatic online update\n\nBenchmarking features:\n-13 benchmark modules to measure CPU, FPU and memory performance\n-Benchmark reference results to compare measured performance to other systems\n-Cache &amp; Memory Benchmark Suite\n-Hard disk, optical drive and flash drive benchmarking with RAID array support\n\nUnique features:\n-UpTime and DownTime statistics with critical errors counter\n-Monitor Diagnostics to check the capabilities of CRT and LCD displays\n-System Stability Test with thermal monitoring to stress CPU, FPU, memory, caches and disks\n-Hardware Monitoring to monitor system temperatures and voltages on the -System Tray, OSD, Vista Sidebar or Logitech keyboard LCD\n-SensorPanel\n-Temperature, voltage and fan RPM data logging to HTML and CSV log files\n-Overheating, voltage drop, overvoltage and cooling fan failure detection\n-High Definition Audio and OpenAL sound card details\n-AMD Stream, Direct3D Compute Shader, nVIDIA CUDA, OpenCL GPGPU device information\n-Smart Battery information\n-Web links: IT portals, software and driver download\n-Manufacturer links: product information, driver and BIOS download\n-Hardware information database for over 121,000 devices\n-Overclock information\n-Fully localized user interface: 35+ languages\n-No installation or setup procedure required\n\n\nWhat's New in version 4.50.3000:\n-OpenCL GPGPU AES-256 cryptography benchmark\n-Extended AMD Mantle graphics accelerator diagnostics\n-Intel H97 and Z97 chipset based motherboards support\n-Improved support for Intel Ã¢â‚¬Å“Haswell-EÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ CPU and DDR4 memory modules\n-Support for DDR4 XMP 2.0 memory profiles\n-A-Data SP920 SSD support\n-GPU details for AMD Radeon R9 295X2, FirePro W9100\n-GPU details for nVIDIA GeForce GT 740, GeForce GTX Titan Z\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\nOS: Windows 8/8.1 , 7 , Vista &amp; XP \n-Processor: Intel Pentium or later\n-System memory: 32 MB or more.
