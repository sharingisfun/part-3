For Elena, formerly popular and involved with school and her friends, it's a struggle to hide her sadness. She finds herself drawn to a handsome and mysterious new student, Stefan, unaware that he is a centuries-old vampire doing his best to live peacefully among humans. His brother, Damon, however, is the embodiment of vampire stereotypes, including violence and brutality, and the two brothers wage a war for the souls of Elena and everyone else in her small Virginia town. Based on the series of novels by L.J. Smith.\n.[/color][/center]\n\n[center][color=red][size=150]Video[/color][/size][/center]\n[center][color=blue]Video Size  :  640*360\nData Rate  :  312 KBPS\nTotal Data Rate  :  398 KBPS\nFrame Rate  :  30 FPS\nEncode :  H.254\nAspect Ratio :  16:9\nMethod  : Lossy\nEncoder  : DTW\nEncoder App  :  FreeMAKE Video Converter\n[/color][/center]\n\n[center][color=red][size=150]Audio[/color][/size][/center]\n[center][color=blue] \nAudio Bit Rate : 96 KBPS\nAudio Encode  :  AAC (Advance Audio Codec)\nSimple Rate  :  16000\nChannel   :   Mono\n[/color][/center]\n\n\n[center][img]http://s10.postimg.org/l1kh8y3gp/cooltext1925887515.gif[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b4e59af30648224ede26530625b3f6efad71ca5","amp;dn":"The+Vampire+Diares+Season+06+Complete+x264+%5BDTW%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b4e59af30648224ede26530625b3f6efad71ca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,78,89,175,48,100,130,36,237,226,101,48,98,91,63,110,250,215,28,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
