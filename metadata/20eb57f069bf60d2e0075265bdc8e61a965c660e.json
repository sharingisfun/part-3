Yet avoidable failures continue to plague us in health care, government, the law, the financial industryÃ¢â‚¬â€in almost every realm of organized activity. And the reason is simple: the volume and complexity of knowledge today has exceeded our ability as individuals to properly deliver it to peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€consistently, correctly, safely. We train longer, specialize more, use ever-advancing technologies, and still we fail. Atul Gawande makes a compelling argument that we can do better, using the simplest of methods: the checklist. In riveting stories, he reveals what checklists can do, what they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and how they could bring about striking improvements in a variety of fields, from medicine and disaster recovery to professions and businesses of all kinds. And the insights are making a difference. Already, a simple surgical checklist from the World Health Organization designed by following the ideas described here has been adopted in more than twenty countries as a standard for care and has been heralded as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the biggest clinical invention in thirty yearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Independent).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20eb57f069bf60d2e0075265bdc8e61a965c660e","amp;dn":"The+Checklist+Manifesto%2C+How+to+Get+Things+Right+-+Atul+Gawande+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20eb57f069bf60d2e0075265bdc8e61a965c660e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,235,87,240,105,191,96,210,224,7,82,101,189,200,230,26,150,92,102,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
