It emerged during the mid 1960s among folk rock and blues-rock bands in the United States and Britain. It often used new recording techniques and effects and drew on non-Western sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. It spread into psychedelic folk, psychedelic rock, psychedelic pop and psychedelic soul in the 1960s before declining in the early 1970s. It helped create many new musical genres including progressive rock, kosmische musik, synth rock, jazz rock, heavy metal, glam rock, funk, electro and bubblegum pop. It was revived in forms of neopsychedelia from the 1980s and re-emerged in electronic music in genres including acid house, trance music and new rave.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tExact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 1\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nCue File:\t\tYes\nM3U File:\t\tYes\nLog file:\t\tIncluded In Torrent Description\n\t\t\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel: \t\t\tPriority Records\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Magic Carpet Ride - Steppenwolf\n02.Pushin' Too Hard - The Seeds\n03.Psychotic Reaction - Count Five\n04.I Want To Take You Higher - Sly &amp; The Family Stone\n05.Time Has Come Today - Chamber Brothers\n06.Black Magic Woman - Santana\n07.Hot Smoke &amp; Sassafras - Bubble Puppy\n08.Pictures Of Matchstick Men - Status Quo\n09.Incense &amp; Peppermints - Strawberry Alarm Clock\n10.Green Tambourine - Lemon Pipers\n11.Sky Pilot - Animals\n12.Summertime Blues - Blue Cheer\n13.Journey To The Center Of The Mind - Amboy Dukes\n14.Crossroads - Cream\n\n\n\nNote: I didn't include the log file in the torrent for technical reasons.
