Where film music sessions are concerned it could be argued that you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to go anywhere else. Woodwinds are so expressive they can be a bugger to sample. So our beliefis to start with the best and then work as hard as we can to honour the talent we have captured.\nThe Flute Consort features three of the finest players in London today one recorded solo, two recorded in unison. They are seated exactly in situ so combine the a2 patches with the solo ones for a slightly larger section whilst maintaining spectral integrity. Volume One features a selection of the most commonly asked for articulations sampled deeply with numerous round robins, dynamic layers. With mixable levels vibrato, numerous mic positions, stereo mixes from Jake Jackson, all of which are presented with a simple, out of the box ease of use and the BML UI. Learn one Spitfire GUI, learn them all. \n\n=======[ Instruction ]===============================================================\n\nFor Kontakt 5.3:\n\n- Open Kontakt 5.3 or above\n- Go to File tab\n- Browse for the torrent folder\n- Drag n Drop the NKI files into the Right Panel to use.\n\n=======[ Extra ]=====================================================================\n\nI DO NOT OWN THIS PRODUCT - IF YOU ENJOY IT, PLEASE CONSIDER BUYING TO SUPPORT OWNER!\n\n=======[ Greets ]====================================================================\n\nGreeting to awesome uploaders:\n\n- deepstatus\n- datsn1pah\n- imafaggot\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5a695c84ea6dd3b9d1e76d8ff21d4952182a9a","amp;dn":"Spitfire+Audio+-+BML+Flute+Consort+Vol.1+%5BKONTAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5a695c84ea6dd3b9d1e76d8ff21d4952182a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,90,105,92,132,234,109,211,185,209,231,109,143,242,29,73,82,24,42,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
