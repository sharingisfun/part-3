Before the final curtain fell, Brown recorded close\n to 100 albums and some 300 singles with various producers, making any attempt to chart his musical history a \ndifficult one. The impressive two-disc Money in My Pocket collection does an admirable job, though, and quite wisely\n gives most of its space to Brown's creative peak in the mid- to late '70s and his work with Winston &quot;Niney&quot; Holness \nand Joe Gibbs, his two most consistently sympathetic producers.\n\n================================\n\nTracklist\n\nCD1\n\n1 \t\tLips Of Wine \t\t\t2:42 \t\n2 \t\tHe Can't Spell \t\t\t3:16 \t\n3 \t\tSilhouettes \t\t\t3:22 \t\n4 \t\tBaby Don't Do It \t\t\t3:00 \t\n5 \t\tThings In Life \t\t\t4:03 \t\n6 \t\tConcentration \t\t\t2:28 \t\n7 \t\tMusical Heatwave \t\t\t2:36 \t\n8 \t\tWhat About The Half \t\t\t2:42 \t\n9 \t\tBlack Magic Woman \t\t\t2:40 \t\n10 \t\tMoney In My Pocket \t\t\t2:31 \t\n11 \t\tStages In Life \t\t\t3:26 \t\n12 \t\tWestbound Train \t\t\t3:08 \t\n13 \t\tCassandra \t\t\t2:46 \t\n14 \t\tI Am The Conqueror \t\t\t2:12 \t\n15 \t\tNo More Will I Roam \t\t\t3:57 \t\n16 \t\tWhy Seek More (Give A Helping Hand) \t\t\t3:07 \t\n17 \t\tThis Tribulation \t\t\t3:08 \t\n18 \t\tTake A Trip \t\t\t3:18 \t\n19 \t\tWolves and Leopards \t\t\t2:48 \t\n20 \t\tWhip Them Jah Jah \t\t\t3:25 \t\n21 \t\tHere I Come Again (aka Have No Fear) \t\t\t2:25 \t\n22 \t\tHere I Come \t\t\t3:02 \t\n23 \t\tFunny Feelings \t\t\t3:20 \t\n24 \t\tBlood Sun \t\t\t3:23 \t\n25 \t\tTenement Yard \t\t\t3:49 \t\n26 \t\tAin't That Loving You \t\t\t3:55 \n\n=============================================\n\nCD2\n\n \t\tEqual Rights \t\t\t2:40 \t\n2 \t\tMoney In My Pocket (1978 Version) \t\t\t3:51 \t\n3 \t\tMan Next Door \t\t\t3:55 \t\n4 \t\tSitting and Watching \t\t\t4:01 \t\n5 \t\tHave You Ever \t\t\t3:49 \t\n6 \t\tLove Has Found Its Way \t\t\t4:31 \t\n7 \t\tHalfway Up, Halfway Down \t\t\t4:31 \t\n8 \t\tThe Prophet Rides Again \t\t\t3:49 \t\n9 \t\tHold On To What You Got \t\t\t3:44 \t\n10 \t\tRocking Time \t\t\t3:41 \t\n11 \t\tPromised Land \t\t\t6:28 \t\n12 \t\tRevolution \t\t\t5:03 \t\n13 \t\tHistory \t\t\t3:57 \t\n14 \t\tThe Exit \t\t\t4:06 \t\n15 \t\tWildfire \t\t\t4:41 \t\n16 \t\tRevolution (Part 2) \t\t\t3:43 \t\n17 \t\tHold Tight \t\t\t3:26 \t\n18 \t\tDeath Before Dishonour \t\t\t3:45 \t\n19 \t\tWisdom \t\t\t3:51 \n\n===========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 32.2 MiB\nTrack name/Position                      : 2CD 26/16\nPerformer                                : Dennis Brown\nComment                                  : Encoded by FLAC v1.1.4a with FLAC Frontend v1.7.1\n\n======================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 809 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nWriting library                          : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062177c27bd0a10a9703d2817a64c448160487a2","amp;dn":"Dennis+Brown+-+Money+in+My+Pocket%2C+The+Definitive+Collection+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062177c27bd0a10a9703d2817a64c448160487a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,33,119,194,123,208,161,10,151,3,210,129,122,100,196,72,22,4,135,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
