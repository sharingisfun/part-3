A mere 21 years old \nat the time of this album's release, Morrison proves here that he's an \nartist to keep an eye on as he develops and matures.\n\nThe 21-year-old presents a spellbinding collection of raw, bittersweet and\nbluesy soulful songs. \n\nHis voice evokes shades of Rev. Al Green and the late Otis Redding,\nremarkable for a blue-eyed Englishman imbuing his material with a genuine \npassion and raw emotion that is honest and inspirational. He comes from a \nless fortunate background and taught himself to sing and play guitar from\nage 5 and has more than enough experience to provide material for this \noutstanding debut. \n\nMartin Terefe sat in the producer's chair (known for his work with \nKT Tunstall, Ed Harcourt and Ron Sexsmith).\n_______________________\n\n1.
