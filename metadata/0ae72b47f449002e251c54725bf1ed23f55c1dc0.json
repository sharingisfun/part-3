It includes a total of fourteen separate albums, most of these consisting of five individual lectures, with the exception of &quot;The Wisdom Series&quot;, &quot;The Love Series&quot; and &quot;Life in the Twenty-First century Series&quot;, each consisting of six lectures. It may seem that some files are missing, but in fact this is because unfortunately the corresponding tapes were not even sold as The Philosophical Research Society considered that the audio quality of the original recordings were too poor.\n\nIn addition to the organized albums, there also exist several hundred recordings of lectures which were not published in albums. Two hundred and eighteen of these were sold as individual cassette tapes, and more exist which have never been made available to the public.\nThe second folder consists of all these two hundreds and eighteen additional lectures that were sold as individual tapes. The individual lectures in this folder are organized by subject matter.\n\nPlease enjoy, share, and, if you are downloading this collection via BitTorrent, please help by continuing to seed after your download is complete.\n\nThe titles of the albums are :\nAlchemy\nAstro-Theology\nAtlantean Hypothesis, The\nAtom in Religion and Philosophy, The\nCycle of the Phoenix, The - A New Approach to the Philosophy of History\nDoctrines of Hermes Trismegistus\nDoctrines of Neoplatonism\nEsoteric Anthropology\nEsoteric Philosophy of H.P.
