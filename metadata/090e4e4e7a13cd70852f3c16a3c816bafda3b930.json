People donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t listen to advertisements, they listen to their peers. But why do people talk about certain products and ideas more than others? Why are some stories and rumors more infectious? And what makes online content go viral?\n\nWharton marketing professor Jonah Berger has spent the last decade answering these questions. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s studied why New York Times articles make the paperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Most E-mailed List, why products get word of mouth, and how social influence shapes everything from the cars we buy to the clothes we wear to the names we give our children. In this book, Berger reveals the secret science behind word-of-mouth and social transmission. Discover how six basic principles drive all sorts of things to become contagious, from consumer products and policy initiatives to workplace rumors and YouTube videos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090e4e4e7a13cd70852f3c16a3c816bafda3b930","amp;dn":"Contagious%3A+Why+Things+Catch+On+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090e4e4e7a13cd70852f3c16a3c816bafda3b930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,14,78,78,122,19,205,112,133,47,60,22,163,200,22,186,253,163,185,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
