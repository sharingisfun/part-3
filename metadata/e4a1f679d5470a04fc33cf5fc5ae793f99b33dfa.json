With its wealth of information and images, elegant design, and time-tested advice this beautiful new book by artist Shay Amber will inspire even the most intimidated beginner. Just as in her celebrated workshops, Amber guides would-be ceramists through all the basics, from selecting the right clay body to embellishing the surface with fabulous decorations and gorgeous glaze treatments to setting a firing temperature. She teaches how to pinch forms, create coils, make flat slabs, work with simple molds and armatures, and ornament your piece with stencils, slips, underglazes, terra sigillata, and more. Each technique is laid out in easy-to-follow step-by-step photos with projects in progress and stunning gallery images. Amber introduces a unique, easy-to-follow method for constructing a beautiful slab-built piece, and all the necessary templates are included. A dozen projectsÃ¢â‚¬â€including a pinched Tea Bowl, coil-built Espresso Cup Set, and luminous Lantern showcase the key methods. Comprehensive and accessible, this illustrated introduction will become the standard on the potterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bookshelf.\n\nCONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION\nCHOOSING AND USING CLAY\nGETTING TO KNOW THE STUDIO\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ TECHNIQUE: FORMING COILS\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢TECHNIQUE: MAKING SLABS\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢TECHNIQUE: SLAB BUILDING\nTECHNIQUE: MAKING AND USING STAMPS\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ INSPIRATION\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢TECHNIQUE: SURFACE DECORATION\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢GLAZING\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢FIRING\nTEMPLATES\nRECIPES\nGLOSSARY\nCONTRIBUTING ARTISTS\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nINDEX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4a1f679d5470a04fc33cf5fc5ae793f99b33dfa","amp;dn":"Ceramics+for+Beginners+-+Hand+Building+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4a1f679d5470a04fc33cf5fc5ae793f99b33dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,161,246,121,213,71,10,4,252,51,207,95,197,174,121,63,153,179,61,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
