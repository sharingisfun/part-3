This murder has all the hallmarks of a contract killing and district attorney Nance Laurel won't let it go. But there is no crime scene investigation and no co-operation from the police. Putting her career on the line, she calls Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs. Their reputation for seeing what others miss is unparalleled, and she knows they will risk everything to seek the truthâ€¦\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\nJeffery Deaver was born outside of Chicago in 1950.
