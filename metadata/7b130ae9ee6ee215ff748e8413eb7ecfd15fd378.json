They rent a lavish penthouse and use it as their launching pad to lure men with money in the bank. But each eventually finds that love is more important than material possessions, though it takes a while. One running joke has Monroe so insecure about her looks that she refuses to wear glasses, though this means she bumps into furniture and walls. The other has Bacall rejecting suitor Cameron Mitchell because he doesn't wear a tie, assuming this means he's low-class when, in fact, he's the Donald Trump of 1954.\n\n  Starring: Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall, David Wayne, Rory Calhoun.\n\n  Directed by: Jean Negulesco.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 32min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b130ae9ee6ee215ff748e8413eb7ecfd15fd378","amp;dn":"How+To+Marry+A+Millionaire+%281953%29+%28Marilyn+Monroe%2C+Betty+Grable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b130ae9ee6ee215ff748e8413eb7ecfd15fd378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,19,10,233,238,110,226,21,255,116,142,132,19,235,126,207,209,95,211,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
