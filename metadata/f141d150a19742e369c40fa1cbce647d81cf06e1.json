The previous two sets Ã¢â‚¬â€œ All The Classic Sides 1946-51 and Vol 2 1946-56 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cover his early years when he became one of the most successful blues artists of his time. By 1959, where this selection picks up the story, LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day seems to have come and gone. He had not recorded for some three years as changing tastes (fuelled by the rise of rock and roll) and LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unwillingness or inability to adapt to them, had led to a serious fall from favour.\n\nSalvation came in the form of Sam Charters and the belief that the burgeoning acoustic folk movement might just offer some potential for bluesmen looking for a new audience. So Sam tracks LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ down in Houston, Texas and, after getting  him a guitar, new strings and whiskey, they return to LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home and knock out a few numbers into Charters tape recorder. And the rest, as they say, is history, as these Charters sessions become his Ã¢â‚¬ËœrediscoveryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album for Folkways and LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is back in demand as both a recording artist and as a live draw (though his unwillingness to travel, certainly fly, limited his scope somewhat both for recording and playing).\n\nThe first 10 tracks on this super new set are these Ã¢â‚¬ËœrediscoveryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recordings. The rest of the sides contained on these 4CDs pull together for the first time the subsequent recordings made in the immediate aftermath of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœrediscoveryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. And for this we should be grateful to JSP and compiler Neil Slaven, demonstrating as they do LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singular commitment to his own personalised style of music. He was seemingly indifferent to trends or ideas of progress and development. LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ just played what he felt when he felt it (and when the money was right). Probably the best sides here are the many where he appears solo; the sides with musical collaborators, even of the calibre of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, held no real appeal to LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as this necessitated some kind of compromise and planning. Not really playing to the strengths of such an instinctive player as our Sam.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f141d150a19742e369c40fa1cbce647d81cf06e1","amp;dn":"Lightnin+Hopkins+-+The+Acoustic+Years+1959-1960+%282013%29+MP3%40320kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f141d150a19742e369c40fa1cbce647d81cf06e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,65,209,80,161,151,66,227,105,196,15,161,203,206,100,125,129,207,6,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
