The show follows the exploits of four Allied soldiers Ã¢â‚¬â€ three Americans and one Englishman Ã¢â‚¬â€ who are part of a long-range desert patrol group in the North African campaign during World War II. Their mission: &quot;to attack, harass and wreak havoc on Field Marshal Rommel's vaunted Afrika Korps&quot;.\n\nThe show was inspired by and loosely modeled on the New Zealand/British/Rhodesian Long Range Desert Group, which used modified trucks armed with machine guns as their transport through the treacherous desert terrain, and Popski's Private Army. The title of the program refers to the nicknames given to some of the British Commonwealth forces in the North African campaign (Rats of Tobruk or Desert Rats). Consequently, at the time of the original telecast many British viewers took offense at the dominance of American characters on the program, the result being that the show was pulled from the BBC after six episodes.[1] (The series was later shown on British satellite television in the '80s.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d8ae95df9983d5898fe00f7c921637536712990","amp;dn":"The+Rat+Patrol+-+58+WWII+Episodes+-+1967+-+1968","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d8ae95df9983d5898fe00f7c921637536712990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,138,233,93,249,152,61,88,152,254,0,247,201,33,99,117,54,113,41,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
