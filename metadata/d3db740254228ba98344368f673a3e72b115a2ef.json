The original version of &quot;Channel 1 Suite&quot; is a classic and contains tenor saxophonist Don Menza's most memorable solo, plus a couple of brilliant improvisations from the explosive drummer/leader. Another highlight is an inventive Phil Wilson arrangement of &quot;Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,&quot; and even &quot;Alfie&quot; (a melodic feature for altoist Art Pepper) and &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; come across well. In addition to the original LP program, three selections were released for the first time on this CD. &quot;Chelsea Bridge&quot; is particularly significant, for it showcases Pepper, who was making a brief (and unsuccessful) comeback seven years before he finally returned to the scene. This spirited and often-exciting set is a real gem and is essential.
