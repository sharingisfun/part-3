Apostol&amp;#039;s writing style is not only accessible and clear but the organization of the text is excellent too. There are plenty of problems with a good mix of difficulty levels. He also throws in an example here and there to give you firm footing on some difficult topics. If I had to recommend one analysis text this would be it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f80b7c283a54a2b7bb099b834a68410f5d3fd6d","amp;dn":"Tom+M.+Apostol+-+Mathematical+Analysis+%285ed+1981%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f80b7c283a54a2b7bb099b834a68410f5d3fd6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,128,183,194,131,165,74,43,123,176,153,184,52,166,132,16,245,211,253,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
