There is no Bibliography or Index.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœImmensely readable and informative . . . belongs in the possession of anyone interested in what the greatest British military thinker of this century has to say . . .' The Soldier\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœLiddell Hart makes the complicated scene intelligible to the reader with the minimum of effort, and yet incorporates an apt and telling comment at every turn.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ The Times Literary Supplement\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœRemarkable for its clarity and objectivity, and for analysis undistorted by professional prejudice or by bitterness over the un-recallable past. It remains outstanding: for those familiar with its subject, illuminating and thought-provoking; for those new to it and wishing to know what happened in World War I, the best place to begin.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Western Mail\nOne of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outstanding teacher-historians, Sir Basil Liddell Hart was born in Paris in 1895 and educated at St PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He joined the Army (KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry) and served in the First World War; in 1924 he was invalided and three years later retired with the rank of Captain. He evolved several military tactical developments including the Battle Drill system and was an early advocate of airpower and armoured forces. In 1937 he became personal adviser to the War Minister, but reorganization of the Army was so slow that he resigned a year later to press the need publicly.\nLiddell Hart was military correspondent to the Daily Telegraph from 1925-35 and to The Times until the outbreak of the Second World War. He lectured on strategy and tactics at staff colleges in numerous countries and wrote more than thirty books. He died in 1970.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12c99f561341bed1f2e3556fbff48db059d0e2e1","amp;dn":"History+of+the+First+World+War+-+Basil+Liddell+Hart.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12c99f561341bed1f2e3556fbff48db059d0e2e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,201,159,86,19,65,190,209,242,227,85,111,191,244,141,176,89,208,226,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
