This 'best of' collection from 1972 includes some magnificent recordings, including 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco', 'Love Look Away', a heart-stopping 'I Wanna Be Around', a rousing 'Sing You Sinners' and more. It is a time capsule album of Tony's earlier career.\n\nWhile his voice is sensational -- it deepens into something beyond compare by the early 1960s -- a few of the songs are the product of their era, notwithstanding Tony's talent. The early 1960s style of adding a background choir and additional echo has a kind of charm, but it sounds like -- well, the early 1960s. The good news is that apart from a 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' that sounds like a bad cabaret tune and a cover of George Harrison's 'Something' that really isn't for Tony (he's a Cole Porter, Gershwin, Johnny Mercer, Rodgers &amp; Hart kind of guy -- best when the music swings or in great ballads), most of this album is a real treasure.\n\nHowever -- some of the albums from which these songs were culled are worth buying. 'I Wanna Be Around' is a superb album, as is 'Who Can I Turn To'. And, if you enjoy live music, the 1962 Carnegie Hall Concert is an outstanding recording that includes much of the classic material here, in rousing renditions. Two CDs of live Tony Bennett in 1962 -- what else could you want?\n\nIf you are looking for an introduction to Tony Bennett, or just appreciate his powerful voice and inimitable spirit -- the guy always sounds like he's smiling into the microphone, and that happiness comes through -- you should enjoy this album. If a couple of the tracks sound a bit like kitsch, so be it.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll Time Greatest Hits\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 48 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
