Alexander, Ronald K. Jurgen, &quot;Standard Handbook of Electronic Engineering&quot;\nMcGraw-Hill; 5th edition | English | 2004-12-20 | ISBN: 0071384219 | 2200 pages | PDF \n\nThe Standard Handbook of Electronics Engineering has defined its field for over thirty years. Spun off in the 1960Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s from FinkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Standard Handbook of Electrical Engineering, the Christiansen book has seen its markets grow rapidly, as electronic engineering and microelectronics became the growth engine of digital computing. The EE market has now undergone another seismic shiftÃ¢â‚¬â€away from computing and into communications and media. The Handbook will retain much of its evergreen basic material, but the key applications sections will now focus upon communications, networked media, and medicineÃ¢â‚¬â€the eventual destination of the majority of graduating EEs these days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11f1e9117f1fe79c498aaa76216ea8ff89a0e2b6","amp;dn":"Standard+Handbook+of+Electronic+Engineering+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11f1e9117f1fe79c498aaa76216ea8ff89a0e2b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,241,233,17,127,31,231,156,73,138,170,118,33,110,168,255,137,160,226,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
