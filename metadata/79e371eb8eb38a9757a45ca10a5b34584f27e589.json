The &quot;retrospective collection&quot; is an 18-track double album with the featured songs chosen by Noel Gallagher; however, it does not actually include their song &quot;Stop the Clocks&quot; after which the album is named. It went 5x Platinum in the UK with sales better than any Oasis release since Be Here Now. \nThe album debuted at number two in the UK charts selling over 50,000 copies in its first day of release and 216,000 in its first week of release, surprisingly not selling enough to knock off the top spot to The Love Album, by the boy-band Westlife. By the end of the year Stop the Clocks had sold 898,000 copies in the UK making it the 7th biggest selling album of the year. It also debuted at number 89 on the U.S. Billboard 200, starting with 18,000 units sold.[4] It did however enter the Japanese Oricon album charts at number one, selling 87,462 copies in its first week. The album has sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide (1.5 million alone in the UK).  In Japan, a box set was also released of all their singles to coincide with the album.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Rock 'n' Roll Star\n[02] Some Might Say\n[03] Talk Tonight\n[04] Lyla\n[05] The Importance Of Being Idle\n[06] Wonderwall\n[07] Slide Away\n[08] Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol\n[09] The Masterplan \n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:44m:21s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Live Forever\n[02] Acquiesce\n[03] Supersonic\n[04] Half The World Away\n[05] Go Let It Out\n[06] Songbird\n[07] Morning Glory\n[08] Champagne Supernova\n[09] Don't Look Back In Anger\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 00h:41m:58s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:26m:21s\nTotal File Size....................... 219mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
