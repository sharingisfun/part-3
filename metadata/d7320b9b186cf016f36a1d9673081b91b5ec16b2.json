Shoemaker, â€ŽJames E. Mack (McGraw-Hill, 2012).epub\r\n\r\nThe definitive guide to distribution and transmission line technology--fully updated\r\nCompletely revised to reflect the 2012 National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), The Lineman's and Cableman's Handbook, 12th Edition, provides in-depth information on overhead and underground distribution and transmission lines. The latest OSHA, ANSI, and ASTM standards are emphasized throughout.\r\n\r\nThis authoritative resource presents basic principles, equipment, standards, and safety regulations, allowing electrical workers to avoid costly errors, diagnose and repair power failures, and ensure optimum safety. A wealth of illustrations and photographs make it easy to understand the material, and self-test questions and exercises help reinforce key concepts.\r\n\r\nComprehensive coverage includes:\r\nElectrical principles and systems * Substations * Circuits * Construction * Wood-pole, aluminum, concrete, fiberglass, and steel structures * Distribution automation * Emergency system restoration * Unloading, hauling, erecting, setting, and guying poles * Insulators, crossarms, and conductor supports * Line conductors * Distribution transformers * Lightning and surge protection * Fuses * Switches, sectionalizers, and reclosers * Voltage regulators * Transmission tower erection * Stringing, sagging, and joining line conductors * Live-line maintenance * Grounding * Street lighting * Underground distribution * Vegetation management * Distribution transformer installation * Electrical drawing symbols * Single-line and schematic diagrams * Voltage regulation * Units of measurement, electrical definitions, electrical formulas, and calculations * Maintenance of transmission and distribution lines * Rope, knots, splices, and gear * Climbing and wood poles * Protective equipment * OSHA 1910.269 * Resuscitation * Pole-top and bucket rescue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7320b9b186cf016f36a1d9673081b91b5ec16b2","amp;dn":"Lineman%27s+and+Cableman%27s+Handbook+12th+ed+-+Thomas+M.+Shoemaker%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7320b9b186cf016f36a1d9673081b91b5ec16b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,50,11,155,24,108,240,22,243,106,29,150,115,8,27,145,181,236,22,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
