Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nAs far as I know, this is the first time the complete Jerusalem Bible has been made available in digital form. The edition used is that of the &quot;Reader's Edition,&quot; so it does not contain the full array of footnotes used in the first edition, but the Bible text itself is complete and includes the full Roman Catholic canon.\n\n\nThe Jerusalem Bible was one of the first, and was the most important, modern translation of the Bible for Catholics, and is still used in the lectionary for the Catholic Church in the UK. It may be worth noting that J. R. R. Tolkien was among the translators of the Old Testament.\n\ndescription:\n\nWhen it comes to Bible translations, readability and reliability are what count; and on both counts, the original JERUSALEM BIBLE stands alone. A product of the age of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), THE JERUSALEM BIBLE (published in 1966) was the first truly modern Bible for Catholics. Using definitive original language texts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, biblical scholars of L'Ãƒâ€°cole Biblique in Jerusalem produced a meticulously accurate, wonderfully readable French translation of the complete canon of Scripture (La Bible de JÃƒÂ©rusalem). From this French original came the English edition, edited by renowned Bible scholar Alexander Jones.\n\nFor all the people around the world who are discovering or revisiting the mysteries contained in the Scriptures, only a clear, understandable Bible translation will do. With language as exquisite but more modern than the King James Version, THE JERUSALEM BIBLE is the one they can trust.\n\nPraise for THE JERUSALEM BIBLE (1966 edition):\n\n&quot;This is one of those really monumental works.--There is just nothing like it in English, and I will not live long enough to see anything like it.&quot;--Father J. L. McKenzie, President, Society of Biblical Literature\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac541e65814c9f2c7291a2f15c813d8ed9c21db0","amp;dn":"The+Jerusalem+Bible+%28Catholic%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac541e65814c9f2c7291a2f15c813d8ed9c21db0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,84,30,101,129,76,159,44,114,145,162,241,92,129,61,142,217,194,29,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
