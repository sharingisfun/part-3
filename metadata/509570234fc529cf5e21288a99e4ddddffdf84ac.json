Enjoy!\n\n\n\nPS:\n\nfrom wiki:\n\n&quot;On June 12, 2007, the first three tracks from Strawberry Jam leaked onto the internet. &quot;For Reverend Green&quot;, &quot;#1&quot;, and &quot;Winter Wonder Land&quot; soon followed on June 18, 2007.\n\nThe internet leak for the record is anomalous in that it&amp;#039;s been leaked in sections. Geologist stated on the Collected Animals message board that the first batch of promotional copies were watermarked, and each journalist&amp;#039;s name would be digitally embedded on any extracted files[6]. On June 19, 2007, a letter from the band&amp;#039;s publicist was sent to music journalists regarding the leaking of the first three songs[7]:\n\n    Last week three tracks from Animal Collective&amp;#039;s new album leaked. Within minutes we were able to track the leak to an writer&amp;#039;s CD. That person got in more trouble than you care to hear about and was almost fired. The person was also forced to write an apology letter to an entire staff of people and the head of Domino Records along with other penance.\n\nAnimal Collective member Panda Bear talked with Shout Mouth regarding the band&amp;#039;s thoughts on the leak[8]:\n\n    The only thing weÃƒÂ¢??re really upset about with the leak is that itÃƒÂ¢??s only parts of it. I think there are six songs out there now. People arenÃƒÂ¢??t even able to get the full experience of the album, which bums us all out quite a bit. So if youÃƒÂ¢??re listening leakers [speaking directly into the tape recorder], put up those other three songs, man, pronto.\n\nThe remaining three tracks; Fireworks, Cuckoo Cuckoo and Derek were all leaked on 4th July 2007.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:509570234fc529cf5e21288a99e4ddddffdf84ac","amp;dn":"Animal+Collective+-+Strawberry+Jam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"509570234fc529cf5e21288a99e4ddddffdf84ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,149,112,35,79,197,41,207,94,33,40,138,153,228,221,221,255,223,132,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
