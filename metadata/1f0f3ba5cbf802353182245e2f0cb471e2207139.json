Insert new scenes easily and hide or show information important to you such as the sceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s action, title and summary. Assign colors to each scene by any criteria, such as storyline, character, location, time of day, and more. Print your scene view or just view it alongside the script. With a double-click you can sync the script to instantly go to any scene youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve selected.\n\n\n\nIndex Cards\n\nFinal Draft has double-sided cards that display the scriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scene on one side and the summary on the other. The summary view allows you to enter text directly into the index card Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plot points, notes, sequence or act markers, comments, locations, blocking Ã¢â‚¬â€œ anything you need to build and organize your story. These notes sync with the Scene Navigator, so any information you add there will automatically appear on the corresponding card. Select and rearrange multiple cards at once if you need to reorder your scenes. Print your index cards directly on 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 cards for use in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“traditionalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ way if you want to visualize and organize scenes outside of the application. Double-clicking on a card in split-panel view will automatically sync the scene selected with your script page.\n\n\n\nTab and Enter Functions\n\nYou can install and start using Final Draft in minutes due to the easy-to-use Tab and Enter functionality that formats the scriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elements to industry standards.\n\n\n\nCustomizable Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nIf you prefer keyboard shortcuts and macros youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already used to, Final Draft allows you to customize your workflow for your writing needs.\n\n\n\nFinal Draft Courier Font\n\nProduction companies and studios need consistent page counts when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re budgeting a script. Final Draft uses its own Courier font to ensure identical pagination on Windows, Macintosh, and the iPad.\n\n\n\nTemplates\n\nIn addition to the standard templates that are included in the software package, the Final Draft Template Library is updated regularly and allows registered users to download over 100 classic and current television shows, screenplay, stageplay, and graphic novel templates.\n\n\n\nFormat Assistant\n\nThis writing tool checks your script for common formatting errors such as missing dialogue, extra spaces, carriage returns, and blank elements. You can set it to run every time you print or only when you want it to.\n\n\n\nText to Speech\n\nHave Final Draft read your script back to you Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can even assign different voices to your characters. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like having a live script reading on your computer.\n\n\n\nThe Panels System\n\nYou probably keep a lot of ideas at the front of your mind while youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re writing. With the Panels system, you can split your screen into separate panels and view your script pages in one panel while you view another section of the script or your Index Cards or Scene View in the other panel. A double-click on any scene will keep the panels in sync.\n\n\n\nWriting Management\n\nUse the Statistics report to check how much content youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve completed in a writing session to help you reach your writing goals. You can also track things such how often Character A interacts with Character B.\n\n\n\nRemember Workspace\n\nIf you are working with multiple drafts, it is important to make sure you are editing the correct one. With the Workspace preference, you can have Final Draft open all the files you had open in your last session, in the correct order.\nNew and Improved Features\nSmart Type with callouts\nView Larger\nScript Notes with callouts\nView Larger\nCharacter Highlights with callouts\nView Larger\nColored Production Pages\nView Larger\n\n\n\n(New) Navigator Features\n\nNo longer just a Scene Navigator, the new Navigator also displays ScriptNotes and Characters arcs.

New in Final Draft 9 is the ability to filter by keyword, allowing you to see important scene details whenever you need them.\n\n\n\n(New) ScriptNotes Navigator\n\nOne of the most useful Final Draft features is back with a brand-new look and enhanced functionality. Sort and filter the ScriptNotes and general notes while you organize by name, type and color. The color-coded anchored ScriptNote markers now appear in the right margin (not in the text) so they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t affect the script pagination.\n\n\n\n(New) Characters Navigator\n\nKeep track of all of your charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ arcs via individual Character Beats assigned to particular scenes. Non-speaking characters can be added to or deleted from any scene, helping you keep track of everyone even if they have no lines in a certain scene.\n\n\n\n(New) Replace Character Names Globally\n\nNo longer do you have to Ã¢â‚¬Å“find and replaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to change a character name Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Final Draft will globally change a characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name in script elements like dialogue and action and will retain the proper casing. It will also change the name in all metadata, such as SmartType lists and the Navigator.\n\n\n\n(New) Character Highlighting\n\nPlanning a table read of your screenplay? Character Highlighting will come in handy to easily distinguish all charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ dialogue. It is also a great feature for tracking a characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dialogue to see if they are being too verbose or too shy.\n\n\n\n(New) Colored Revised Pages\n\nFinal Draft is going green, giving you the ability to distribute your script electronically with the colored revised production pages. When you export to PDF, revised pages are a solid Blue, Pink, Yellow, Green, etc. When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re working in an FDX file, the revised page will have the revision setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s color on the left and right borders only. Writing in clean white is easy on the eyes but there will be no doubt as to which revision set youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re working in.\n\n\n\n(New) Watermarking in Printing or PDF\n\nProtect your script by identifying the recipient via a customizable watermark that displays in PDF and on the printed pages.\n\n\n\n(New) Standardized Paper Size\n\nEach FDX file maintains its own correct paper size (either A4 or US Letter) no matter where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opened.\n\n\n\n(Improved) Spell Checking\n\nChecking your work has never been easier Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SmartType list words are automatically integrated in the spell-checker that features almost more than 300 new words. Additionally, the thesaurus is now in the context menu, so a right-click will give you alternative words to help make your description as vivid as possible.\n\n\n\n(New and Improved) Windows Enhancements\n\nThe Final Draft 9 user interface is updated to the new Windows ribbon look with new buttons, backgrounds and menus, but longtime users can have the same experience they've come to love by switching back to Classic mode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0f3ba5cbf802353182245e2f0cb471e2207139","amp;dn":"%5BWin%5DFinal+Draft+v9.0.7+Build+184","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f0f3ba5cbf802353182245e2f0cb471e2207139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,15,59,165,203,248,2,53,49,130,36,94,47,12,180,113,226,32,113,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
