Otherwise PS3 or PC Users will not be able to experience 5.1 audio as you cannot bitstream AAC5.1 for 99% of the products.\n\nPC Users with 5.1 Surround:\n\nDepending on your configuration, VLC should automatically enable 5.1 playback, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1\n\nIf 5.1 isn't selected by default, and you do have 5.1 system, ensure your windows sound configuration is setup correctly by navigating to your windows control panel ~ Sound and then selecting the primary audio device followed by clicking the CONFIGURE button below, follow the steps to ensure 5.1 mode is fully enabled.\n\nPC Users with 2.0/2.1 Stereo:\n\nDepending on your configuration, VLC should automatically enable 2.0 playback, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 2.0\n\nIf 5.1 is selected by default, and you do not have 5.1 system, ensure your windows sound configuration is setup correctly by navigating to your windows control panel ~ Sound and then selecting the primary audio device followed by clicking the CONFIGURE button below, follow the steps to ensure 2.0 mode is fully enabled only.\n\n\nScreenshot Previews:\n            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img202/803/0b8b.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img202/803/0b8b.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img708/113/35ot.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img708/113/35ot.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img32/1742/5w68.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img32/1742/5w68.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img801/6190/cygi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img801/6190/cygi.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img585/6619/atd9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img585/6619/atd9.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/7744/5rwb.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/7744/5rwb.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img32/1134/k48v.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img32/1134/k48v.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img585/107/wosv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img585/107/wosv.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img854/7707/ji2g.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img854/7707/ji2g.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img843/6875/fm26.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img843/6875/fm26.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease, be patient with seeding...\n\nEnjoy ;)\n\nFeel free to leave a + vote and a comment, Thank You!\n\n\nJudas's Note:\n\nThose of you whom are &quot;Bronies&quot; or as some prefer to be referred to as &quot;Pegasisters&quot; (Fans of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic), I would highly recommend/suggest you save up the few dollars it would take to order/purchase your own copy of this bluray movie. Since it's the first Blu-ray version of anything mlp related, it would be terrible to destroy any chance of getting more Blu-ray editions of the mlp movies or series as well by never supporting the product ever.\n\nI provide movies for the singular purpose of giving people a choice, allowing whom don't have access to such content at all, those that have bought the product but cannot play it or need a significantly reduced space friendly version, and many other cases that would apply but have gone unmentioned. I hope people that enjoy what they watch try to make an attempt to purchase their own legal copy. It helps sway future projects to actually happen.\n\nI've purchased mine, have you purchased yours?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:711cac1b50f1f0a385648687387706e13a6e1f4d","amp;dn":"My+Little+Pony+Equestria+Girls+%282013%29+1080p+5.1+BrRip+x264+-+Jud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"711cac1b50f1f0a385648687387706e13a6e1f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,28,172,27,80,241,240,163,133,100,134,135,56,119,6,225,58,110,31,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
