(Oof. Here we go again.)  Im  a  mercenary  with  an\n accelerated healing factor. Ive been described as unstable, which is just\n plain coo-coo. (Wait, do sane people say coo-coo?) Im  gonna  battle  for\n the safety of humans and mutants. (And even mumans.) Be prepared for  just\n about anything. (Holla!)\n\n\n Features:\n =========\n\n * I made sure to capture all my good sides, so I made my game a\n   third-person action-shooter. (Yep, you get to look at my heinie.)\n * Keep a look out cuz some of my X-Men pals (Whoa, what pals?!) are making\n   an appearance. (Hope you dont mind picking hair out of your tacos.)\n * Im really good at killing, so I made it a blast stringing together\n   combos, and totally eviscerating my enemies. (Ev-is-cer-a-ting!)\n * I brought my skills and a buttload of my favorite things. Katanas\n   (check), guns (bang!) explosives (boom), duct tape (quack) and of\n   course, yours truly - ME! (Checkmate!)\n\n\n Installation Information:\n =========================\n\n * Burn or mount\n * Install\n * Play the game\n\n NOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\n\n                                                             /TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\n\n                    +-+  QUALITY, TRADITION  AND PRIDE +-+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10485ea3a1a9561f4c54a0c0267bbd3927ddde60","amp;dn":"Deadpool-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10485ea3a1a9561f4c54a0c0267bbd3927ddde60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,72,94,163,161,169,86,31,76,84,160,192,38,123,189,57,39,221,222,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
