During a career spanning more than half a century he recorded exclusively for the RCA Victor label after signing with it in 1943. &quot;Mr. C&quot;, as he was nicknamed, sold millions of records for RCA and pioneered a weekly musical variety television show, which set the standards for the genre and proved to be one of the most successful in television history. His combined success on television and popular recordings was not matched by any other artist of the time.\n\nA popular television performer and recording artist, Perry Como produced numerous hit records with record sales so high the label literally stopped counting at Como's behest. His weekly television shows and seasonal specials were broadcast throughout the world and his popularity seemingly had no geographical or language boundaries. He was equally at ease in live performance and in the confines of a recording studio. His appeal spanned generations and he was widely respected for both his professional standards and the conduct in his personal life. In the official RCA Records Billboard Magazine memorial, his life was summed up in these few words: &quot;50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all.&quot;\n\nTracks:\n  \n1 Magic Moments  2:41 \n2 Catch a Falling Star  2:29 \n3 And I Love You So 3:20 \n4 It's Impossible 3:16 \n5 Love Makes the World Go 'Round (Yeah Yeah)  2:53 \n6 Tomboy  2:03 \n7 Delaware  2:22 \n8 For the Good Times  3:40 \n9 I Know  2:21 \n10 I Think of You  3:37 \n11 Mandolins in the Moonlight  2:43 \n12 Kewpie Doll  2:35 \n13 Round and Round  2:35 \n14 More  2:37 \n15 Ko Ko Mo (I Love You So)  2:41 \n16 Hot Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom)  2:23 \n17 Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes  2:41 \n18 Wanted  3:07 \n19 Idle Gossip 3:02 \n20 Papa Loves Mambo  2:41\n\n                     Thank you for seeding :o) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbad3fedd0e5afb981c1da1e8fcf560881f841c3","amp;dn":"Perry+Como+-+Very+Best+Of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbad3fedd0e5afb981c1da1e8fcf560881f841c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,173,63,237,208,229,175,185,129,193,218,30,143,207,86,8,129,248,65,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
