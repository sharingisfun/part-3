The television series is based on the series of novels by Maureen Jennings.\n\nThe series takes place in Toronto starting in 1895 and follows Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) of the Toronto Constabulary, who solves many of his cases using methods of detection that were unusual at the time. These methods include fingerprinting (referred to as &quot;finger marks&quot; in the series), blood testing, surveillance, and trace evidence.\n\nSome episodes feature anachronistic technology whereby Murdoch sometimes uses the existing technology of his time to improvise a crude prototype of a technology that would be more readily recognizable to the show's 21st-century audience. In one episode, for instance, he creates a primitive version of sonar to locate a sunken ship in Lake Ontario. In another, he effectively invents wire-tapping. In still another, a foreign police officer has a photograph which Murdoch needs as evidence, so Murdoch asks the other officer to overlay the photograph with a grid which is numerically coded for the color in each square, and then to transmit the numerical data to Murdoch via telegraph, with the end result that the foreign officer has essentially sent Murdoch a bitmap image they call a &quot;facsimile&quot;, a telefax.\n\nIn August 2010, Shaftesbury Films announced that production on season four had begun and was scheduled to continue through November 2010. Guest stars in season four include Victor Garber, Lisa Faulkner, Simon Williams, Peter Keleghan, Craig Olejnik, and Lisa Ray. On October 15, 2010 Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his daughter visited the set of Murdoch Mysteries. As part of the visit to the set Stephen Harper filmed a cameo appearance.\n\n\nEpisode Synopses courtesy of:\n\nThe On-line TV Database\nAn Open Database for Television Fans &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2011-02-15 - Tattered and Torn (Video:H264 688x386, 1061kbps, 24fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 104kbps)\n\nWhen a strange case crosses his desk; body parts, a foot, a hand and a headless torso - have surfaced along the Don River.
