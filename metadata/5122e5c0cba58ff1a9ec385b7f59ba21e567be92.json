Why do footballers earn so much more than the rest of us? Which country is likely to be the world's leading economy in 10 years' time? And how does economics affect each one of us, every day? In the seventh volume of the successful 50 Ideas series, economist Edmund Conway introduces and explains the central ideas of economics in a series of 50 clear and concise essays. Beginning with an exploration of the basic theories, such as Adam Smith's Ã¢â‚¬Ëœinvisible hand', and concluding with the latest research into the links between wealth and happiness, he sheds light on all the essential topics needed to understand booms and busts, bulls and bears, and the way the world really works. Packed with real-life examples and quotations from key thinkers, 50 Economics Ideas provides a fascinating overview of how economics influences every aspect of our lives, from buying a house to what we had for breakfast this morning.\n\nEdmund Conway is economics editor of the Sky News. He was Media Leader at the World Economics Forum in Davos, 2008, and makes frequent TV and radio appearances. He lives in London.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5122e5c0cba58ff1a9ec385b7f59ba21e567be92","amp;dn":"50+Economics+Ideas+You+Really+N+-+Edmund+Conway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5122e5c0cba58ff1a9ec385b7f59ba21e567be92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,34,229,192,203,165,143,241,169,236,56,91,127,89,186,33,229,103,190,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
