Covert missions take you through hostile environments where only your expertise in stealth, tactics and firepower will ensure the success and safety of your men. Your missions are as unpredictable as they are dangerous: from vital scud-hunting missions deep within enemy territory to highly secretive rescue and assassination operations in Baghdad itself. As the first line of defense, your objective is clear: Protect Freedom.\n\nHardware Requirements\n\nOperating System: Windows ;95/98/Me/2000/XP Processor: Pentium II ;300 MHz (Pentium II 500 MHz recommended) Memory: 32 MB RAM (64 MB recommended) Hard Disk Space: 500 MB ;free hard drive (+50 MB for swapfile) CD-;ROM Drive: 4X Speed or higher Video: ;DirectX 8.0-compatible video card (must be able to display 1024 x 768 resolution and 16-bit color depth) Sound: DirectX 8.0- compatible sound card DirectX: DirectX version 8.0 (included) or higher\n\nscreenshot avelebal on\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pc.gamezone.com/gamesell/screens/s18995.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pc.gamezone.com/gamesell/screens/s18995.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDownload Winrar and open file and dobbal clik Desert Storm Icon And Enjoy And Seeding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5629b7422a02efddf1eff9c4af17aba495a9fde","amp;dn":"Conflict%3A+Desert+Storm+PC+Action+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5629b7422a02efddf1eff9c4af17aba495a9fde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,98,155,116,34,160,46,253,223,30,255,156,74,241,122,186,73,90,159,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
