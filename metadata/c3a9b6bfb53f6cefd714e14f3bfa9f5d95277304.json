It covers a vast array of subjects, from basic DC circuits to introductory topics in RF Communications. It is a tool by an instructor, for instructors, to help you accomplish more, with fewer resources:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ in less time\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ at a lower attrition rate\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ with a greater sense of accomplishment for you and your students.\nimage\nI have designed the many lab activities to meet a large percentage of the requirements of distance learning for students of electronics. Students are free to learn without concern about parts and instrument failures, saving time and budgets. Students can, and I might add, should, be introduced to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“real instrumentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when they are already competent in its use. I have worked with Multisim for years, and love it more with every new update. The program is continually upgraded as the needs and requirements of learning electronics grow. It is incredibly userfriendly. The instruments and components closely match those found in the real world. Some of the instruments such as the Agilent Multimeter, Oscilloscope and Function Generator are actual instruments that exist in physical laboratories. Students who use these instruments in Multisim can immediately transfer their knowledge to the bench. Virtual reality exists in these instruments! Multisim allows National Instruments LabVIEW virtual instruments to be used as well as the exporting of signals to the LabVIEW environment. Importing of real-world LabVIEW signals is also incorporated into Multisim. One example of a LabVIEW virtual instrument can be found in the SpectrumAnalyzerIntro lab in Section 10. NI ELVIS breadboarding environments play a strong supportive role throughout the scope of this workbook. 1-2 Practical Teaching Ideas with Multisim The acquisition of Electronics Workbench by National Instruments adds exciting new dimensions to the education of all electronics students. The flow from the real electronic world to the simulated electronic world and back again is now seamless in its interchangeable enhancement of environments. Some of MultisimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great strengths are:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ provides a virtual lab for distance learning\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ familiarizes students with instrument and component use\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ its ease-of-use allows students to concentrate on learning electronics\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ more effective teaching of troubleshooting concepts.\n\nIf you are teaching electronics, I believe that many of the ideas in this book will help you.
