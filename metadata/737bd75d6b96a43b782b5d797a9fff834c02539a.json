Dark Souls is  a\nspiritual  successor  to  Demon's,  not  a  sequel.  Prepare  for  a  new,\ndespair-inducing  world,  with  a  vast,  fully-explorable  horizon  and\nvertically-oriented  landforms.  Prepare  for  a  new,  mysterious  story,\ncentered around the the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to  die.\nYou will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly  grotesque  mobs\nand several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses.  You\nmust learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world.  And  you\narent alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in\nyour world, so you can learn from their deaths and  they  can  learn  from\nyours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure,  or\ninvade other's worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which\nserve as check points as you fight your way through this  epic  adventure.\nWhile rested at Bonfires, your health and magic replenish but at  a  cost,\nall mobs respawn. Beware: There is no place in Dark Souls  that  is  truly\nsafe. With days of game play and an even more punishing difficulty  level,\nDark Souls will be the most deeply challenging game you  play  this  year.\nCan you live through a million deaths and earn your legacy\n\nInstallation Information\n\n1.
