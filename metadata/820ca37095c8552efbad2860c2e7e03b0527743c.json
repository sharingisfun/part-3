It began its 59 week chart run on Christmas Day, topping the Billboard Album chart for six weeks starting on 8 January 1966. The album sold 1.2 million copies within nine days of its release, and to date has sold over six million copies in America.\n\nThe American edition differed markedly from its British counterpart. Capitol removed &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, and replaced them with two from the UK Help! album: &quot;I've Just Seen a Face&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love&quot;. Through peculiarities of sequencing, by placing the Help! tracks at the beginning of each side, Rubber Soul was deliberately reconfigured to appear a &quot;folk rock&quot; album to angle the Beatles into that emergent lucrative American genre during 1965.  In 2014, the Capitol edition of Rubber Soul was released on CD again, individually and included in the Beatles boxed set, The U.S. Albums.\n\nTrack Listing [US - REMASTER] [320k MP3]\n\nMONO &amp; STEREO - REMASTERS\n\n01. \t&quot;I've Just Seen a Face&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:04\n02. \t&quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;   \t2:05\n03. \t&quot;You Won't See Me&quot;   \tMcCartney \t3:19\n04. \t&quot;Think for Yourself&quot; (Harrison) \tHarrison \t2:19\n05. \t&quot;The Word&quot;   \tMcCartney and Lennon \t2:42\n06. \t&quot;Michelle&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:42\n07. \t&quot;It's Only Love&quot;   \tLennon \t1:53\n08. \t&quot;Girl&quot;   \tLennon \t2:33\n09. \t&quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:24\n10. \t&quot;In My Life&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:24\n11. \t&quot;Wait&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:15\n12. \t&quot;Run for Your Life&quot;   \tLennon \t2:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:820ca37095c8552efbad2860c2e7e03b0527743c","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Rubber+Soul+%5BUS+-+REMASTER%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"820ca37095c8552efbad2860c2e7e03b0527743c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,12,163,112,149,200,85,46,251,173,40,96,194,231,224,59,5,39,116,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
