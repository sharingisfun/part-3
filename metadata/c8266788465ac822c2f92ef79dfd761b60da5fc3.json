The juxtaposition of the audience's first impression of her with the standing ovation she received after her performance led to an international media and Internet response. Within nine days of the audition, videos of Boyle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the show, various interviews, and her 1999 rendition of &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ had been watched over 100 million times, an online record. Despite the sustained media interest, she later finished in second place in the final of the show, behind dance troupe Diversity.\n\nBoyle's first album, I Dreamed A Dream, will be released on 23 November 2009, and has become Amazon's best-selling album in pre-sales. Its first single is a cover of the Jagger/Richards song &quot;Wild Horses.&quot; The album is also expected to include &quot;You'll See,&quot; &quot;I Dreamed a Dream,&quot; &quot;Memory,&quot; and &quot;Cry Me a River.&quot;\n\n\t\t\n1. \t&quot;Wild Horses&quot;   \t \t\n2. \t&quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot;   \n3. \t&quot;Cry Me a River&quot;   \t\n4. \t&quot;How Great Thou Art&quot;   \t\n5. \t&quot;You'll See&quot;  \n6. \t&quot;Daydream Believer&quot;   \t\n7. \t&quot;Up to the Mountain&quot;   \n8. \t&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;   \t\n9. \t&quot;Who I Was Born to Be&quot;   \t  \t\n10. \t&quot;Proud&quot;   \t\n11. \t&quot;The End of the World&quot;   \t\n12. \t&quot;Silent Night&quot;   \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8266788465ac822c2f92ef79dfd761b60da5fc3","amp;dn":"Susan+Boyle+-+I+Dreamed+A+Dream+CDRip+2009+%5BCov%2BCD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8266788465ac822c2f92ef79dfd761b60da5fc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,38,103,136,70,90,200,34,194,249,46,247,157,253,118,27,96,218,95,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
