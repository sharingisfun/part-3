While midwives preside over the majority of births in Europe and Japan, fewer than ten percent of American mothers employ them, despite their proven record of care and success. How do American doctors make their choices regarding the way their patients give birth, and who is intended to benefit? Director Abby Epstein and producer Ricki Lake offer a probing look at childbirth in America in this documentary The Business of Being Born, which explores the history of obstetrics, the history and function of Midwives, and how many common medical practices may be doing new mothers more harm than good. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995061/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995061/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: 124 kb/s VBR MP3, Joint Stereo (English)\nSubtitles: None\nVideo: 1020 Kbps Xvid at 23 fps\nResolution: 608 x 352\n\nRunning Time: 1 Hour 25 Minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4783e6c5d0cee7b2a7104fbfbd5173a6ecd152a4","amp;dn":"The+Business+of+Being+Born+%282008%29+-+Xvid+-+JackTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4783e6c5d0cee7b2a7104fbfbd5173a6ecd152a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,131,230,197,208,206,231,178,167,16,79,191,189,81,115,166,236,209,82,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
