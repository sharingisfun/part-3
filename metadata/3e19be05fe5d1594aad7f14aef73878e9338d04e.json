Whether due to an injury, infection, or something else, pain alerts a person that something is not right. Sometimes pain goes along with inflammation and swelling, and when it does, the problem is more evident. Oftentimes, pain is more generalized to the entire body, signaling a viral infection such as a flu virus. Still other times, there is no apparent root cause for a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pain. Yet, millions of people suffer from some form of pain on a daily basis.\n\nUnderstanding Pain walks readers through the various types of pain, the causes and symptoms, as well as the methods of treatment currently available. From prescription medication to acupuncture and massage therapy, various approaches may work for some but not for others. But handling pain is essential for living well and functioning on a daily basis. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the subject, covering self-care as well as caring for others in pain, and addressing alternative as well as traditional methods of pain management","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e19be05fe5d1594aad7f14aef73878e9338d04e","amp;dn":"Understanding+Pain%2C+An+Introduction+for+Patients+and+Caregivers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e19be05fe5d1594aad7f14aef73878e9338d04e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,25,190,5,254,93,21,148,170,215,241,74,239,115,135,142,147,56,208,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
