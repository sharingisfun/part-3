Regulation is mediated via many different mechanisms; it is when these mechanisms fail, and regulation is lost, that cancer can result. Recent advances in molecular cell biology have greatly expanded our understanding of the processes and mechanisms that underpin the regulation of cell replication, and what is happening at the molecular level when these fail.\n\nThe third edition of The Molecular Biology of Cancer: Mechanisms, Targets, and Therapeutics offers a fresh approach to the study of the molecular basis of cancer, by showing how our understanding of the defective mechanisms that drive cancer is leading to the development of new targeted therapeutic agents.\n\nOpening with an overview of the key hallmarks of cancer as a disease state, the book then leads us through the principal processes that become altered in cancer cells, and explains how the failure of these processes can lead to the onset of cancer. \n\nUniquely, within each chapter, students are shown how this molecular knowledge is being applied to develop new targeted therapeutic strategies.\n\nWritten with students in mind, the book features a variety of learning features to help students engage with, and master, the concepts presented. The emphasis is not on exhaustive coverage of the field, but on acquiring a solid understanding of the essentials of the subject--and an appreciation of how a theoretical understanding can be transformed into therapeutic benefit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:475248a76b3739627452fe5f2e417dafe8251e49","amp;dn":"Molecular+Biology+of+Cancer%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"475248a76b3739627452fe5f2e417dafe8251e49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,82,72,167,107,55,57,98,116,82,254,95,46,65,125,175,232,37,30,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
