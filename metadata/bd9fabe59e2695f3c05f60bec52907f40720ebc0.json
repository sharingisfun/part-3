Gerarde Depardieu delivers a deep and moving performance as the count, and the star laden international cast does not disappoint either. I must admit it is difficult to perceive the 200+ pound Depardieu as a starving prisoner in the Chateau-Dif, but this is part of where a viewer must suspend belief and let the story be told, and it does this in such a wonderful manner.\n\nThis is the first version of the story I have ever seen that does not try to abbreviate the tale, or make characters into composites of people from the book in an effort to save time. Albeit there are always some changes in a screen-play from a book, but this so far is the truest adaptation of Dantes work.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd9fabe59e2695f3c05f60bec52907f40720ebc0","amp;dn":"The+Count+of+Monte+Cristo+-+Alexandre+Dumas+%28Gerard+Depardieu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd9fabe59e2695f3c05f60bec52907f40720ebc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,159,171,229,158,38,149,243,192,95,96,190,197,41,7,244,7,32,235,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
