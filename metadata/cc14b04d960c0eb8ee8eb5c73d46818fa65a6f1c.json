Yet when Darby befriends Esme, a Barbizon maid, sheâ€™s introduced to an entirely new side of New York City: seedy downtown jazz clubs where the music is as addictive as the heroin thatâ€™s used there, the startling sounds of bebop, and even the possibility of romance.\r\nOver half a century later, the Barbizonâ€™s gone condo and most of its long-ago guests are forgotten. But rumors of Darbyâ€™s involvement in a deadly skirmish with a hotel maid back in 1952 haunt the halls of the building as surely as the melancholy music that floats from the elderly womanâ€™s rent-controlled apartment. Itâ€™s a combination too intoxicating for journalist Rose Lewin, Darbyâ€™s upstairs neighbor, to resistâ€”not to mention the perfect distraction from her own imploding personal life. Yet as Roseâ€™s obsession deepens, the ethics of her investigation become increasingly murky, and neither woman will remain unchanged when the shocking truth is finally revealed.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc14b04d960c0eb8ee8eb5c73d46818fa65a6f1c","amp;dn":"The+Dollhouse+-+Fiona+Davis+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc14b04d960c0eb8ee8eb5c73d46818fa65a6f1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,20,176,77,150,12,14,184,238,142,181,199,61,70,129,143,166,90,111,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
