The repertoire is weighted toward the Latinate, featuring primarily popular song and opera excerpts from Italy, Spain, and Latin America, but also included are songs from The Merry Widow, Carousel, Singin' in the Rain, and West Side Story. Most of the music has a strongly Romantic, emotionally charged, lyrical feeling that's enhanced by the lush orchestral arrangements. James Levine and Zubin Mehta provide the accompaniment, leading Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Orchestra del Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Los Angeles Music Center Opera Chorus, and Orchestre de Paris. The sound is excellent and detailed even though the concerts were recorded live. The enthusiasm of the audience is evident throughout, and they frequently break into spontaneous applause.\n\n\nGenre................: Opera\nYear.................: 2002\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n01.'O Sole Mio\n02.Funiculi, Funicula\n03.Libiamo Ne Lieti Calici (Brindisi)\n04.Sous Le Ciel De Paris\n05.Torero Quiero Ser\n06.Parlami D'amore Mariu\n07.Manha De Carnaval\n08.Lolita\n09.Dicitencello Vuie\n10.Core 'Ngrato\n11.Because\n12.You'll Never Walk Alone\n13.Singin' In The Rain\n14.Maria/Tonight/'O Passe D' 'O Sole/Cielito Lindo\n15.Ochi Tchorniye/Caminito/La Vie En Rose\n16.Mattinata/Wien, Wien, Nur Du Allein/Amapola\n17.Lippen Schweigen\n18.Brazil\n19.Sous Le Ponts De Paris\n20.Torna A Surriento\n21.Nessun Dorma\n22.La Donna ÃƒË† Mobile\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91230b6a01e1d947464eabc14202b1db0af7b2f0","amp;dn":"Carreras+Domingo+Pavarotti+-+Best+Of+The+3+Tenors+2002+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91230b6a01e1d947464eabc14202b1db0af7b2f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,35,11,106,1,225,217,71,70,78,171,193,66,2,177,219,10,247,178,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
