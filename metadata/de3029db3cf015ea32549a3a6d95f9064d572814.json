Ferriss uses cooking to teach Ã¢â‚¬Å“meta-learning,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a step-by-step process that can be used to master anything, whether searing steak, speaking Spanish, or shooting 3-pointers in basketball.\n\n6 Reasons to Read This Book\nEven if You Hate Cooking\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Learn How to Become World-Class in Any Skill in Record Time.\n\nWhether you want to learn how to speak a new language in three months, how to shoot a three-pointer in one weekend, or how to memorize a deck of cards in less than a minute, the true Ã¢â‚¬Å“recipeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of this book is exactly that: a process for acquiring any skill. The vehicle I chose is cooking. Yes, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll teach you all the most flexible techniques of culinary school using 14 strategically chosen meals, all with four or fewer ingredients, and all taking 5-20 minutes to prepare (literally, The 4-Hour Chef). But I wrote this book to make you a master student of all things.\n\nEating (And Life) Will Become High-Definition.\n\nIn China, a common greeting is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chi le, mei you?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Have you eaten?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This is the universal check-in. So I pose the question to you: have you really eaten? I now realize that before writing 4HC, I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Back then, food was either good or bad, hot or cold, spicy or not. Now, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a million colors, and I can pick out the subtleties: the cilantro or tarragon, the umami savoriness, or the lack of vinegar. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like going from a 7Ã¢â‚¬Â³ black-and-white TV to HD. Before 4HC, much of my life was in black and white. As youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see, the awareness we build in the kitchen and in related adventures will affect everything. Life itself becomes high-definition.\n\nYou Will Get Into The Best Shape of Your Life.\n\nThe dishes youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn, apart from desserts for Ã¢â‚¬Å“cheat day,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are all compliant with the Slow-Carb Diet, which has become a global phenomenon (page 74). Fat loss of 20 pounds in the first month is not uncommon. If you follow this book, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to think about following a diet, since itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built in. If you ever decide to follow another diet, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be twice as effective, because youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll understand how to manipulate and maximize food.\n\nIt DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Take Much to Become Impressive.\n\nIn the first 24 hours, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take you from burning scrambled eggs to osso buco, one of the most expensive menu items in the world. If 28% of Americans canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cook at all, and if another third are on some variation of mac and cheese, having even one seemingly difficult meal up your sleeve puts you in rare company. Make that two bulletproof meals and you can host impressive dinner parties for the rest of your life.\n\nCooking is The Mating Advantage.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to dramatically improve your sex life, or to catch and keep Ã¢â‚¬Å“the one,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ cooking is the force multiplier. Food has a crucial role in well-planned seduction for both sexes, whether in long-term relationships (Ã¢â‚¬Å“MLBJ,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ page 234) or on first dates (Sexy-Time Steak, page 186). For real romantic superpowers, learn how to teach the skill of tasting (Learning to Ã¢â‚¬Å“TasteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, page 50).\n\nBecause ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fun.\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“practicalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ fails more than weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to admit. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take breaks in this book as often as necessary to keep you amused. Food marathons? Check (page 468). Hysterical kitchen lore anecdotes? Tons. Eating 14,000 calories in 20 minutes (page 454)? Why not?\n\nThis isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a textbook. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure book. \n\nAs Bruce Lee said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de3029db3cf015ea32549a3a6d95f9064d572814","amp;dn":"Timothy+Ferriss+-+The+Four+Hour+Chef+eBook+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de3029db3cf015ea32549a3a6d95f9064d572814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,48,41,219,60,240,21,234,50,84,154,58,109,149,249,6,77,87,40,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
