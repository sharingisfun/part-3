In addition to being a healthy, extremely effective way of losing weight, the Mediterranean diet is considered an effective means of avoiding or reversing many health issues, such as obesity, pre-Diabetes, and cardiovascular issues.\n\nOn 2/25/2013, The New England Journal of Medicine reported, &quot;Mediterranean diet supplemented with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts resulted in an absolute risk reduction of approximately 3 major cardiovascular events per 1000 person-years, for a relative risk reduction of approximately 30%, among high-risk persons who were initially free of cardiovascular disease.&quot;\n\nBased on the findings by The New England Journal of Medicine, The New York Times reported, &quot;About 30 percent of heart attacks, strokes and deaths from heart disease can be prevented in people at high risk if they switch to a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil, nuts, beans, fish, fruits and vegetables, and even drink wine with meals, a large and rigorous new study has found. The findings, published on The New England Journal of Medicine's Web site on Monday, were based on the first major clinical trial to measure the diet's effect on heart risks. The magnitude of the diet's benefits startled experts. The study ended early, after almost five years, because the results were so clear it was considered unethical to continue.&quot;\n\nThe Mediterranean diet encourages meals which consist largely of healthy foods such as whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, olive oil and other healthy fats, fish and seafood, nuts, legumes and dairy products. Meat and poultry are kept to a minimum, and foods are prepared in ways that maximize their health benefit, including sauteing, broiling, roasting and grilling.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet is very low in saturated fats, yet provides a high-protein, high-fiber diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and Omega 3s.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet focuses on healthy ingredients and preparation, rather than reducing what you eat or counting calories. The biggest difference with respect to other diets is that the Mediterranean diet leaves one feeling comfortably full, rather than hungry, as most diets do. As a result, adherents to the Mediterranean diet are more successful in losing and maintaining their ideal weight, and enjoy higher energy, more restful sleep, and better overall health.\n\nExtensively researched, The Mediterranean Diet explains the fundamental concepts of the Mediterranean diet in easy-to-understand language, and provides expert tips, guidelines, recipes, and even meal plans for maximizing your success in achieving your ideal weight and health.\n\n\n\nHow to Open EPUB Files?    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n               Support the Editors &amp; Buy the Book If you Like it \n\n                        \nScreen:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaLDeAaem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaLDeAaem&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n            --As Eternity has reckoned There's a lifetime in a second--\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n*Seed as long you can(1:1 ratio is appreciated)\n*If you don't like what you see then don't download.Simple\n*Don't hit and run.Most of these torrents will not be greater than 100MB in size\n*Quality will be top notch regardless of file size be it Videos or Pictures\n*Any torrent which needs seeding kindly comment in that section\n*Visit my uploads @    &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&lt;/a&gt;     &amp;\n*Comments are always welcome \t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371d99a2384bdfd725d37ac7317835ff47152ae9","amp;dn":"The+Mediterranean+Diet%3A+Unlocking+the+Secrets+to+Health+and+Weig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371d99a2384bdfd725d37ac7317835ff47152ae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,29,153,162,56,75,223,215,37,211,122,199,49,120,53,255,71,21,42,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
