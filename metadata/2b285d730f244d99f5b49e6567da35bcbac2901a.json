While economists have always welcomed a reduction in marginal \n\ncost, they never anticipated the possibility of a technological revolution that might bring marginal costs to near zero, making goods and services priceless, nearly free, and \n\nabundant, and no longer subject to market forces.\n\nNow, a formidable new technology infrastructureÃ¢â‚¬â€the Internet of things (IoT)Ã¢â‚¬â€is emerging with the potential of pushing large segments of economic life to near zero marginal cost \n\nin the years ahead. Rifkin describes how the Communication Internet is converging with a nascent Energy Internet and Logistics Internet to create a new technology platform that \n\nconnects everything and everyone. Billions of sensors are being attached to natural resources, production lines, the electricity grid, logistics networks, recycling flows, and \n\nimplanted in homes, offices, stores, vehicles, and even human beings, feeding Big Data into an IoT global neural network. Prosumers can connect to the network and use Big Data, \n\nanalytics, and algorithms to accelerate efficiency, dramatically increase productivity, and lower the marginal cost of producing and sharing a wide range of products and \n\nservices to near zero, just like they now do with information goods.\n\nThe plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economyÃ¢â‚¬â€part capitalist market and part Collaborative CommonsÃ¢â‚¬â€with far reaching implications for society, according to \n\nRifkin. Hundreds of millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to the global Collaborative Commons. Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling IoT \n\nand making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost. They are also sharing cars, homes, clothes and \n\nother items via social media sites, rentals, redistribution clubs, and cooperatives at low or near zero marginal cost. Students are enrolling in free massive open online courses \n\n(MOOCs) that operate at near zero marginal cost. Social entrepreneurs are even bypassing the banking establishment and using crowdfunding to finance startup businesses as well \n\nas creating alternative currencies in the fledgling sharing economy. In this new world, social capital is as important as financial capital, access trumps ownership, \n\nsustainability supersedes consumerism, cooperation ousts competition, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“exchange valueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the capitalist marketplace is increasingly replaced by Ã¢â‚¬Å“sharable valueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the \n\nCollaborative Commons.\n\nRifkin concludes that capitalism will remain with us, albeit in an increasingly streamlined role, primarily as an aggregator of network services and solutions, allowing it to \n\nflourish as a powerful niche player in the coming era. We are, however, says Rifkin, entering a world beyond markets where we are learning how to live together in an \n\nincreasingly interdependent global Collaborative Commons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b285d730f244d99f5b49e6567da35bcbac2901a","amp;dn":"The+Zero+Marginal+Cost+Society+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b285d730f244d99f5b49e6567da35bcbac2901a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,40,93,115,15,36,77,153,245,180,158,101,103,218,53,188,186,194,144,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
