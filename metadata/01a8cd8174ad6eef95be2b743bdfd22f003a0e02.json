His second book is the natural extension of Start with Why, expanding his ideas at the organizational level. \n\nDetermining a companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WHY is crucial, but only the beginning. The next step is how do you get people on board with your WHY? How do you inspire deep trust and commitment to the company and one another? He cites the Marine Corps for having found a way to build a culture in which men and women are willing to risk their lives, because they know others would do the same for them. \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not brainwashing; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually based on the biology of how and when people are naturally at their best. If businesses could adopt this supportive mentality, employees would be more motivated to take bigger risks, because theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d know their colleagues and company would back them up, no matter what. Drawing on powerful and inspiring stories, Sinek shows how to sustain an organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WHY while continually adding people to the mix.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Educational | Buisiness | Self Help | Leadership","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01a8cd8174ad6eef95be2b743bdfd22f003a0e02","amp;dn":"Leaders+Eat+Last+by+Simon+Sinek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01a8cd8174ad6eef95be2b743bdfd22f003a0e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,168,205,129,116,173,110,239,149,190,43,116,59,223,210,47,0,58,14,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
