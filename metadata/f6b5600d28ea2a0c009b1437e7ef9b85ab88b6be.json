Unlimited tracking layers handle reflections, obstructed and blurred objects, even areas with low detail. The AdjustTrack module and overlay tools help solve tracking challenges with pixel-perfect accuracy.\n\nAdvanced Roto Tools: \nCreate animated roto masks with less keyframes. X-spline and Bezier creation tools are purposely designed for artists to easily create detailed roto shapes. When linked to mochaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s planar tracking, roto shapes inherit motion and perspective, dramatically reducing manual keyframe work. Advanced tools for shape editing include per-point edge feathering, join layers tool, transform tool, group layers and more making mocha the ideal system for rotoscoping. \n\nObject Removal &amp; Clean Plating: \nAutomatically remove unwanted elements, wires, rigs and tracking marks with ease. mocha ProÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Remove Module is an amazing alternative to traditional clone and paint techniques for getting rid of unwanted pixels and removing objects. It automatically detects and blends pixels from other frames with little user input, offering massive time savings. mocha ProÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clean plate functionality imports and corrects fixed frames for digital beauty work and matte painting.\n\n3D Camera Solver: \nCamera tracking for 3D visual effects. Solve 3D match moving capabilities with planar ease. Unlike feature based tracking, mocha solves the 3D camera based on user-selected planes. This fast and easy-to-use solution is ideal for set extensions, 3D text and particle tracking. Additionally the 3D solver can be used to assist other 3D tracking applications on difficult shots with low detail or significant foreground occlusions. \n\nStereoscopic 3D: \nNew tools optimized for stereo 3D projects. mocha Pro 4 has been updated to support native stereo 3D. This new workflow uses planar tracking analysis on Ã¢â‚¬Å“both eye viewsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to reduce manual offsets and tedious keyframe work on stereo 3D rotoscoping, tracking, 3D camera solve and object removal.\n\nLens Module: \nCalibrate, correct and remove lens distortion. This simple and easy-to-use interface allows users to calibrate the distortion introduced by camera lenses. Unwanted lens distortion can be removed or matched for realistic compositing. Export to the free mocha Lens plug-in for After Effects or export distortion map data for Nuke, Flame, Fusion and more*. \n\nStabilize Module: \nSmooth camera jitter and lock down shots. The stabilize module can lock down camera motion or stabilize moving objects for visual effects and finishing work. A smooth option with selectable anchor frames helps reduce high frequency jitters while maintaining original camera motion. Center, scale or crop stabilized footage based on user driven planar tracking. \n\nInsert Module: \nRender match moves and screen inserts with motion blur or mesh warp distortion. The Insert Module allows you to render an image onto a tracked surface within mocha Pro. Powerful mesh warp distortion tool allows the user to wrap and bend inserts onto non flat surfaces. Combines with Lens Module for realistic VFX compositing on distorted footage.\n\n\nWhat's New in version 4.1: \n(Released: Nov 03 2014)\n-Open Splines:You can now draw open splines by finishing with Shift+RightClick. These splines export to After Effects CC 2014 and Nuke\n-EXR 2.0: We now support EXR 2.0 multi-part files\n-Export to Nuke SplineWarp: We now export to the Spline Warp node so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to copy splines from Roto nodes to the effect\n-Export shape data to HitFilm 3 Pro: A new shape format for the upcoming Hitfilm 3 Pro\n-Save/Load 3D Solves: You can now save your solved 3d data to the project file\n-Additional 3D Camera Solver Result Improvements: You can now get more\nconsistently accurate results\n-Next/PreviousControlPointShortcuts: You can now cycle though spline points using the { and } keys\n-Python Initialization: We include an init.py file for running startup scripts. See the Python User Guide for more details\n-Python Updates: There are multiple additions to the Python API. See the Python Reference for more details.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nRecommended Requirements: \n-Windows: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows XP Professional SP2 or higher, Windows Vista Business or Ultimate, on x64\n-Recommended Hardware Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo or equivalent\n-Memory: 4 GB +\n-Disk: High-speed disk array \n-Graphics Card: NVDIA Quadro FX 1500 or equivalent \n-Monitor: 1920Ãƒâ€”1080 or higher \n-Network: Must have an enabled network adapter (wifi or ethernet) \n\nMinimal Requirements: \n-Processor: At least 1-GHz Pentium IV \n-Disk: At least 1 GB \n-Memory: At least 1 GB \n-Graphics card: Must support OpenGL \n-Monitor: Minimum resolution 1200Ãƒâ€”800 pixels \n-Network: Must have an enabled network adapter (wifi or ethernet)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6b5600d28ea2a0c009b1437e7ef9b85ab88b6be","amp;dn":"Imagineer+Systems+Mocha+PRO+4.1.0+%2864-Bit%29-XFORCE+%5BATOM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6b5600d28ea2a0c009b1437e7ef9b85ab88b6be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,181,96,13,40,234,42,12,0,155,20,55,231,239,155,133,171,136,182,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
