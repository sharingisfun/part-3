Jack must use a variety of weapons, traps, and fire to kill or repel Skull Island's fauna. Kong's levels are third-person brawlers set on Skull Island and New York City, where Kong must puzzle his way through environmental obstacles and thrash his opponents\n\n- Survive as Jack in a world crawling with predators and live the legend as Kong.\n- Use weapons, traps, and your team wisely to survive in first-person as Jack.\n- Break jaws, slam enemies, and throw massive objects in Kong's colossal third-person battles.\n\n\n------------------------\nGamer's Edition notes:\nUnlike the regular edition, Gamer's Edition is a port of X-Box 360, rather than a simple X-Box.
