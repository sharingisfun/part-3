Superb direction by Vittorio De Sica (The Bicycle Thief) and a sparkling original script by Neil Simon (The Goodbye Girl) make After the Fox an absolute &quot;must-see&quot; (Leonard Maltin)! Millions of dollars' worth of gold bullion is on its way from Cairo to an unknown Italian destination. There is only one criminal mastermind capable of stealing it: Aldo Vanucci (Sellers), also known as &quot;the Fox.&quot; Aldo devises the perfect plan to seize the gold: Posing as a flamboyant film director, he casts an aging, egotistical film star (Victor Mature) and his own voluptuous sister (Britt Ekland) in a fake film about a gold theft! But the action really heats up when the boat with the real gold arrives.\n\n  Starring: Peter Sellers, Victor Mature, Britt Ekland, Martin Balsam, Akim Tamiroff.\n\n  Directed by: Vittorio De Sica.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 39min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f80ee5bf1ee953175c212e6ce62446d4bfc2995","amp;dn":"After+the+Fox+%281966%29+%28Peter+Sellers%2C+Victor+Mature%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f80ee5bf1ee953175c212e6ce62446d4bfc2995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,128,238,91,241,238,149,49,117,194,18,230,206,98,68,109,75,252,41,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
