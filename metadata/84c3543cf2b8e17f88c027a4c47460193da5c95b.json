His job is to record an ancient ritual, but before he does so, an ailing woman named Mrs. Malek has to die. Impatient and aggressive, the engineer befriends a small boy who becomes his spy and provides updates on the old woman's health. When she fails to die and instead gets better, the trip that he thought would take three days stretches into two weeks, and the pressure from Tehran builds. \n\nKiarostami favors long, leisurely shots that capture the serenity of the village and exult in the gorgeous, ocher-colored landscape. The engineer, who walks too fast and asks too many questions, is the counterpoint to that peaceful, lost-in-time world.\n\nWhen his cell phone rings and he's unable to hear the caller, he jumps in his Jeep and rushes to higher ground so he can talk to Tehran. He doesn't realize how absurd he appears. Gradually, almost to his surprise, he learns to respect the villagers and their simple values, to thrive on fresh air.\n\nKiarostami captures landscape with a loving eye -- some shots are ecstatically beautiful -- and offers a vivid illustration of one man's spiritual arousal\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : The Wind Will Carry Us.1999.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 306 Kbps\nLength            : 6.05 GiB for 1h 58mn 36s 202ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC\nAspect            : 1280 x 692 (1.850) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fa\n\nAudio #1          : AAC\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209463/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209463/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Persian\nSubtitles: English\n\nSecond audio track is a commentary track, in English\n\nMy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84c3543cf2b8e17f88c027a4c47460193da5c95b","amp;dn":"The+Wind+Will+Carry+Us.1999.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84c3543cf2b8e17f88c027a4c47460193da5c95b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,195,84,60,242,184,225,127,136,192,39,164,196,116,96,25,61,165,201,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
