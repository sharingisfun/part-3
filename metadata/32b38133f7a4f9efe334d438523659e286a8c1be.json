The former, the so-called LIVES (Bioi) of distinguished Greek and Roman statesmen and military leaders, demonstrate Plutarch's historical and rhetorical abilities, and show his interest in character formation and politics.  Plutarch was not concerned with history so much as the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of men, and the Lives are arranged in pairs to illuminate their common moral virtues and vices.  He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to that of a painter, and went to tremendous lengths (often leading to tenuous comparisons) to draw parallels between physical appearance and moral character.\n\nPlutarch's philosophical works, many of them dialogues, cover half of his literary output.  In modern times they have been published under the collective term &quot;Moralia&quot;, or &quot;Ethical Essays&quot;, mostly in dialogue format.  Despite the name, many of these essays are not limited to ethical subjects but devoted to a broad range of philosophical topics, including metaphysics, psychology, natural philosophy, theology, logic, and the philosophy of art.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB + MOBI format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* ADVICE TO THE BRIDE &amp; GROOM / A CONSOLATION TO HIS WIFE: English Translations, Commentary, Interpretive Essays and Bibliography (Oxford University Press, 1999).
