Impressive for the quality of archival color footage, William Shatner's competent narration, and the film's haunting musical score. Chronicles nearly every U.S. nuclear test program, from Trinity to the end of atmospheric testing in the late 50s. Also includes footage of the Soviet's 50-megaton &amp;quot;super bomb&amp;quot;.\n\nTrinity and Beyond carefully avoids overwhelming you with meaningless dialogue. Instead, Shatner introduces each chapter sparingly, then allows you to sit back and absorb the spectacle of the explosions while listening to the score. The result is a perfect blend of sight, sound, and historical background. Overall, a terrific documentary and a definite must-buy for the history buff in your family.\n\n(comment at imdb.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0752339e41abecb1d6645cb0e3d18b09e8737fb3","amp;dn":"Trinity+And+Beyond+-+The+Atomic+Bomb+Movie+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0752339e41abecb1d6645cb0e3d18b09e8737fb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,82,51,158,65,171,236,177,214,100,92,176,227,209,139,9,232,115,127,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
