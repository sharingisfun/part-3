Her sisters, and especially her Mother overshadow her with their beauty. She is a spiritual, superstious and naive woman. She visits a psychic seer who tells her she must follow the sex trade in order to be happy. Not long after she meets her eccentric and sexy neighbour, Suzy, who, by all counts appears to be a high class prostitute and encourages Juilet into sexual acts which make her guilty and nervous.\n\nFrom the mind of legendary director Federico Fellini and his amazing group of artists, writers, actors, camera crew, designers and production team involved with Juliet of the Spirits, Fellini's first colour feature film. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one woman's tale of a marriage full of indiscretion and infidelity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a story thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing short of a lavish Technicolor transformation through the hypnotically hallucinatory swinging 1960s. The colours in her mind... her dreams, her fantasies, her confusion... become mirrored on the screen for all to see in its lushly grandiose presentation.\n\nThe story of Juliet (Giulietta Masina, Fellini's real wife) and her neglectful, unfaithful husband Giorgio is based to a certain extent on Fellini's relationship with his wife, his psychic friends, and his sexual relations both with men (his most famous being director Pier Paolo Pasolini, who was later famous for his landmark 1975 film Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a merging of the Marquis De Sade's novel and Fascist Italy) and women, although Fellini claimed this film was a brainchild born of his LSD drug usage. While these elements combined may seem utterly seething with hedonism and selfishness, Juliet of the Spirits is actually a compassionate and loving testament to all that Fellini loved in this world.\n\nThe use of plastics and artificial substances throughout the film suggest a message of false reality in the main character's world, which feels very much like the real world can be at times. The filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s subtly over-accentuated prism of colour and light ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ amidst a constantly mutating connection between the dream world and the real world ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ provides an ambiguous psychedelic experience like no other director could have accomplished. Trademark Fellini ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as his future films would show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ full of colourfully strange characters, noise, and passion, Juliet of the Spirits is Fellini's very essence, in every sense of the word. Not only did it bankrupt him because of its box office and critical failure when it was released, ruining his life for about five years until his next film (Fellini's Satyricon, which shows how Juliet of the Spirits helped Fellini embrace his homosexuality), but it also changed entire philosophy on filmmaking.\n\nYou might remember Juliet of the Spirits from Woody Allen's reference to it in the movie theatre scene in Annie Hall, when Allen encounters a loud-mouthed know-it-all intellectual trying to impress his girlfriend with his knowledge of Fellini. Or you may know about it simply because it is arguably Fellini's most personal masterpiece, but those who may have stumbled upon it and don't know much about Fellini's films most certainly couldn't choose a better one to start with. It is a film that gave him life, as most of his films and work in cinema did. As Fellini once said, &quot;There is no end. There is no beginning. There is only the infinite passion of life.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/8529/bscap0000qa8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/8529/bscap0000qa8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3118/bscap0002iw7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3118/bscap0002iw7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/700/bscap0007pu0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/700/bscap0007pu0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/3351/bscap0015yz7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/3351/bscap0015yz7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------not my rip--------\n\n\t\n\n(2CD version from KG, I joined and unpacked avis, joined subs)\n\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 688x368 (***ERROR***) [=***ERROR***] [=1.870]\nFPS ...................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1301 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.206 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[N-VOP]...[]...[]\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR audio\nInterleave ............: 40 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1 \n\n    *****************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
