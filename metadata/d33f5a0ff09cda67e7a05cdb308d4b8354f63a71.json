This essential title is missing from the torrent world, so here it is.\n\n---=Wiki=----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLes Diaboliques (1954) is a black-and-white film directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, starring Simone Signoret and VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ra Clouzot. The title translates as 'The Devils'. It was called The Fiends when released in the UK, while the US release is entitled Diabolique. It is based on the novel Celle qui n'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tait plus (She Who Was No More) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac.\n\nThe film created a sensation on its original release. It has often been likened to the films of Alfred Hitchcock in that it is still creepy even when one has seen it and knows the ending. (Many sources say that Alfred Hitchcock missed out on purchasing the rights to the Boileau and Narcejac novel by just a few hours, Clouzot getting to the authors first.)[1] The end credit contains an early example of an &quot;anti-spoiler message&quot;, requesting the audience not to disclose the plot to others who have not seen the film.\n\nThe film gained additional press when only five years after its release, VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ra Clouzot died of a heart attack at age 46, similar to the way her character in the film died.\n\n---=Rip Info=------------------------------------------------------------------------\tVideo: 812 MB (90.70%)\n\tAudio: 72.8 MB (8.13%)\n\tAVI Overhead: 10.5 MB (1.17%)\n\t\n\t---=Audio=-------------------------------------\n\t0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n\t48000Hz  87 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo LAME3.97 \n\tInterleave: 1 vid frame (42 ms), preload=504\n\t\n\t---=Video=-------------------------------------\n\t512 x 384 @ 23.976 fps, XviD\n\t1:56:27, 167,515 frames\n\tQf 0.207/975 kbps\n\n\t---=Size=--------------------------------------\n\t939,067,392 bytes (167,515 frames)\n\n\t---=Subtitles=---------------------------------\n\tEnglish SUB/IDX\n\t\t\n\t---=Credits=-----------------------------------\n\tThanks to Tansir DVD World\n\tRip by -=:ZEiNAB:=-\n\t\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
