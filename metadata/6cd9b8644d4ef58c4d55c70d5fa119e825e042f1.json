Yet the least downloaded and worst seeded file of them all (Users seem to fear compressed files indexed by uploaders with no trust status... Why this would matter on a *moderated* torrent site is beyond me). A last attempt.\n\nTrue PDF (104 MB).\ncompressed (zipped): [b]right-click[/b] the filename (.7z) &amp; choose [b]Extract[/b] to convert to PDF; discard the .7z file (container) when done with seeding.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cd9b8644d4ef58c4d55c70d5fa119e825e042f1","amp;dn":"General+Chemistry+10th+Edition+c2011+Petrucci+bookmarked+txtbk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cd9b8644d4ef58c4d55c70d5fa119e825e042f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,217,184,100,77,78,245,140,77,85,199,13,95,161,25,232,37,224,66,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
