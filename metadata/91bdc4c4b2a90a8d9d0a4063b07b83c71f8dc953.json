RCA's Best of Clannad: In a Lifetime is a fairly standard overview that touches on fan favorites, collaborations, and songs from films, once again omitting any material from their first four -- largely traditional -- recordings. While this may help with the flow -- it does -- it would be nice to hear the group's shape-shifting styles chronicled more thoroughly. Clannad are at their best when unleashing gargantuan choruses against Moya Brennan's hushed leads, and the inclusion of the beautiful &quot;Newgrange,&quot; a mystical ode to one of Britain's famous stone circles, and &quot;Caislean Oir,&quot; the leadoff track from the band's excellent 1985 release, Macalla, are prime examples. It's when the group abandons its lush new age tendencies and embraces generic adult contemporary pop -- &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; -- that the veil falls away, revealing a fast-food combo meal where there was once an elegant supper.\nAll Music Review by James Christopher Monger\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] In A Lifetime - - - Clannad &amp; Bono\n[02] Theme From Harry's Game\n[03] I Will Find You (Theme From &quot;Last Of The Mohicans&quot;)\n[04] What Will I Do\n[05] Almost Seems (Too Late To Turn)\n[06] Both Sides Now - - - Clannad &amp; Paul Young\n[07] Robin (The Hooded Man)\n[08] Newgrange\n[09] Of This Land\n[10] Something To Believe In - - - Clannad &amp; Bruce Hornsby\n[11] CaisleÃƒÂ¡n Ãƒâ€œir\n[12] Trail Of Tears\n[13] RÃƒÂ­ Na Cruinne\n[14] Buachaill An Ãƒâ€°irne\n[15] Sirius\n[16] A Dream In The Night\n[17] FadÃƒÂ³\n[18] Christmas Angels\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:15m:31s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Saltwater (Chicane Featuring Moya Brennan)\n[02] Uirchill An Chreagain\n[03] CroÃƒÂ­ CrÃƒÂ³ga\n[04] Na Laethe Bhi\n[05] Dobhar\n[06] Coinleach Glas An FhÃƒÂ³mhair (Cantoma Mix)\n[07] Together We (Cantoma Mix)\n[08] Caislean Ãƒâ€œir (Planet Heaven Mix)\n\nCD02 Play Time - 00h:39m:48s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:55m:19s\nTotal File Size....................... 276mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
