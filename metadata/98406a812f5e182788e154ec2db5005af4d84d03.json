Mixing warm, brassy funk and soul grooves with Latin jazz and cumbia, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a soft sort of fusion, mixing flavours with a lightness of touch.\n\nThe title-track blends florid soul and cosmic lyrics to a swinging, funky backbeat, like Minnie RipertonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Les Fleurs with a spot of swagger in its step. Travelling Song sets RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spectacular soul voice to a Latin strut decorated with group backing vocals and warmly produced strings. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trouble in paradise, too. Su Suzy ups the tempo, a barrio soul lament about a woman trapped in a violent relationship, powered by Afro-Cuban rhythms, horns that sound like a warning, and a sonic effect that mimics the sound of approaching police sirens.\n\nIt is, as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect, expertly played Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a vividness to Look Around the Corner that reaches some way beyond mere chops. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an exceptional collaboration that proves thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life in the old soul yet.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98406a812f5e182788e154ec2db5005af4d84d03","amp;dn":"Alice+Russell+%26amp%3B+Quantic...Look+Around+The+Corner%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98406a812f5e182788e154ec2db5005af4d84d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,64,106,129,47,94,24,39,136,225,84,236,45,181,0,90,244,216,77,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
