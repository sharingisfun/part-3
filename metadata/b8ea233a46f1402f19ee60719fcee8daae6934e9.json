Creative Illustration\n\n2. Eye of The Painter\n\n3. Figure Drawing\n\n4. Fun with a Pencil\n\n5. Heads Hands\n\n6. Sucessful Drawing\n\n\nPenned almost 75 years ago by Andrew Loomis, this is a treasure for students of \n\ndrawing and those who want to learn 3D modelling in Maya, 3D Max, Softimage, \n\nCinema 4D, Photoshop, CorelDRAW and other allied software programs. Grab them \n\nwhile you can, for such a complete collection does not exist anywhere on the \n\nInternet  and is rarely available in hard copy. Please seed so that others can \n\nshare this treasure :)\n\n\n\nMy similar torrent (uploaded about 2 years back) was deleted from TPB ( I don't \n\nknow why), but I am reuploading this again as there was a demand for this even as \n\nlate as 10 Jan 2013. It seems that with every torrent I upload, my oldest torrent \n\ngets deleted. I have lost quite a few good 'In Demand' torrents this way !\n\nPlease seed to keep this torrent alive.\n\n\nI have also included excellent 146 Handwriting Fonts for Windows in this torrent.\n\n=============================================================================\n\nSEED AND ENJOY !\n\nTHE UPLOADS  ARE VIRUS / MALWARE FREE.\n\nALL CREDIT TO AN ARMY OF UPLOADERS / CRACKERS / REVERSERS\n\nLEAVE COMMENTS FOR OTHER DOWNLOADERS TO REFER.\n\nAND REMEMBER TO ENJOY ! OR THE DOWNLOADS  WON'T WORK  : )\n\n==============================================================================\n\nTHE MOMENT WE REPENT AND ASK GOD FOR FORGIVENESS FOR OUR LAPSE, WE ARE PURGED OF \n\nOUR SIN AND NEW LIFE BEGINS FOR US. TRUE REPENTANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE \n\nOF PRAYER.\n\n\n===============================================================================\n\nGOD BLESS.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8ea233a46f1402f19ee60719fcee8daae6934e9","amp;dn":"Andrew+Loomis+Books+%2B+146+Handwriting+Fonts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8ea233a46f1402f19ee60719fcee8daae6934e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,234,35,58,70,241,64,47,25,238,96,113,159,206,232,218,174,105,52,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
