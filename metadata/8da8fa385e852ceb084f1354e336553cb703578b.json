(April 2007) \n\nIn the 1960s, the Brooke Bond Tea Company began including a series of military aircraft cards with packages of their tea. The cards proved popular, and the artist Dick Ward proposed the idea of publishing illustrated books about military aircraft. The idea was approved and a small subsidiary company called Osprey was formed. The companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first book, North American P-51D Mustang in USAAF-USAF Service, was published in 1969. Soon after, Ward proposed trying the same idea with famous military units, and in 1971 the first Men-at-Arms title appeared.\n\nOver the next 20 years, the firm grew steadily, adding new titles and new series to their catalogue. Although they have produced books of all types, the main focus remains on military history, particularly the military history of Britain. Osprey Publishing now has over 30 employees and publishes an average of 10-12 books a month.\n\nShire Books was acquired in 2007, and the science fiction, fantasy and horror imprint Angry Robot Books was purchased from HarperCollins in 2010.[1]\n\nNotable authors\nDuncan B Campbell, author of several ancient world titles\nMichael Chappell, prolific writer and illustrator for Osprey Publishing.\nDavid G.
