It offers a translation of two secret scrolls. The first, Heika Jodan, contains 290 lessons for samurai during times of peace, expanding students' martial abilities and preparing them mentally and tactically for the conflicts to come. The second scroll, Ippei Yoko, moves the student onto the field of battle, providing guidance for those taking up arms for the first time.\r\n\r\nWritten by master tactician Natori Masazumi, the first two Natori-Ryu documents give an in-depth account of samurai skills and actual practice, opening up the lost world of these Japanese warriors to all readers interested in martial arts and the arts of war in general.\r\n\r\nPublished by Watkins in 2015 (9781780288857)\r\n\r\nEnglish, 301 pages, Retail EPUB\r\n\r\nNot my scan.
