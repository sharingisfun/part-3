The name &quot;Hari Nayak&quot; is rapidly becoming synonymous with all-natural Indian cooking, due in large part to his collaboration with Cafe Spice, the quick-serve restaurant chain and line of &quot;Meals to Go&quot; for which he is Culinary Director. The Cafe Spice Cookbook provides devotees with the recipes and tips they need to prepare healthy and authentic Indian dishes, using ingredients available at any supermarket or health food store, for that Cafe Spice taste without having to run to the prepared foods isle or nearest location.\n\nSo how did Nayak turn delicious and wholesome Indian food into an American success story? As a young boy, he watched his grandmother grind fresh spices in the traditional stone mortar, heard the splutter of curry leaves being thrown into hot oil, and knew that making good food was his destiny. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, he met restaurateur Sushil Malhotra, founder of Cafe Spice. Today, his Cafe Spice recipes are in the hot bars and refrigerators of a range of outlets nationwide, including Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh and Costco, a number of college campuses such as UMASS, MIT, Tulane, and KU and corporate dining courts like Chrysler and JP Morgan Chase.\n\nCookbook consumers are always hungry for simple, accessible recipes that deliver authentic flavor, and The Cafe Spice Cookbook makes it easy for today's health-conscious home cooks to prepare light and fresh versions of classic dishes like Chicken Tikka Masala or Shrimp and Mango Curry as well as a bounty of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free recipes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73081040f242b5f2018f157393eb463ae90eec63","amp;dn":"The+Cafe+Spice+Cookbook+-+Hari+Nayak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73081040f242b5f2018f157393eb463ae90eec63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,8,16,64,242,66,181,242,1,143,21,115,147,235,70,58,233,14,236,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
