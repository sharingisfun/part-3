But it has not always been easy to see how to apply these insights in the real world â€“ until now. \r\n \r\nIn How to Have a Good Day, Webb explains exactly how to apply this science to our daily tasks and routines.

Through it all, Webb teaches us how to navigate the typical challenges of modern workplacesâ€”from conflict with colleagues to dull meetings and overflowing inboxesâ€”with skill and ease.\r\n \r\nFilled with stories of people who have used Webbâ€™s insights to boost their job satisfaction and performance at work, How to Have a Good Day is the book so many people wanted when they finished Nudge, Blink and Thinking Fast and Slow and were looking for practical ways to apply this fascinating science to their own lives and careers. \r\n \r\nA remarkable and much-needed book, How to Have a Good Day gives us the tools we need to have a lifetime of good days","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0619ac63a6670a7cb4cca64e53916995ca29a1a3","amp;dn":"Caroline+Webb+-+How+to+Have+a+Good+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0619ac63a6670a7cb4cca64e53916995ca29a1a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,25,172,99,166,103,10,124,180,204,166,78,83,145,105,149,202,41,161,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
