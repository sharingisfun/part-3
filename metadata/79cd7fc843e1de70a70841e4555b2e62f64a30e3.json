Forget hours on the treadmill, and forget daily visits to the gym. This new program offers 20 minute workout sessions, once or twice per week, with an alluring emphasis on rest and recovery on your days off. The principle behind The Power of 10 is simple: by lifting weights in slow motion, making each rep last 20 seconds (10 seconds lifting and 10 seconds lowering) instead of the typical 7 seconds, you can maximize muscle transformation. The short workouts are so effective that your body will need days to recover and repair properly. Studies have shown that such routines can increase lean body mass, help burn calories more efficiently, and prevent cardioÃ¢â‚¬â€œvascular disease more effectively than aerobic exercise alone. \n\n===================\n\n8 Things You MUST Do To Build Maximum Muscle Mass\n\n8 Things You MUST Do To Build Maximum Muscle Mass\n\nSean Nalewanyj \n2008\nEnglish\nISBN: NA \nPDF \n27 pages \n1.35 MB\n\nIn this book you get 8 basic, simple steps that you can utilize on your journey to increased muscle mass and strength. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79cd7fc843e1de70a70841e4555b2e62f64a30e3","amp;dn":"Power+of+10+-+Slow+Motion+Fitness+Revolution+%2B+8+Things+To+Build","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79cd7fc843e1de70a70841e4555b2e62f64a30e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,205,127,200,67,225,222,112,167,8,65,228,85,91,46,98,246,74,48,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
