It is often cited (alongside Can's Monster Movie) as the original Krautrock album. \n\n\nNote: Krautrock is a German avant-garde / experimental rock movement that emerged at the end of the 1960's. The term krautrock was originally a humorous one coined by the UK music press (such as New Musical Express and Melody Maker), where &quot;krautrock&quot; found an early and enthusiastic underground following. \nJulian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says &quot;Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon,&quot; based on the way the music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew.  The term is also a problematic category due to the considerable differences between the artists so labelled.\nKey artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon DÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¼l II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3468103e2b5e219e5fcd955eb7163268ff22eaad","amp;dn":"Amon+Duul+II+-+Phallus+Dei+1969+%2F+2006+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3468103e2b5e219e5fcd955eb7163268ff22eaad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,104,16,62,43,94,33,158,95,205,149,94,183,22,50,104,255,34,234,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
