However, on the eve of a property deal of a lifetime, a financial crisis hits and the banks call in their huge loans. Harry and his family lose everything in an instant. Everything, except the dormant and forgotten Three Brothers Fish &amp; Chip Shop half owned by Harry's larger than life brother Spiros who's been estranged from the family for years. With no alternative, Harry and his family, plant enthusiast James; fashion victim Katie; nerdy Theo and their loyal nanny Mrs. Parrington, are forced to pack their bags, leave their millionaire lifestyle and join 'Uncle Spiros' to live above the neglected Three Brothers chippie. Together they set about bringing the chip shop back to life under the suspicious gaze of the their old rival, Hassan, from the neighbouring Turkish kebab shop whose son has his own eyes on Katie. Each family member must come to terms with their new life in their own way and make the most of their reduced circumstances. Harry struggles with the banks to regain his lost business empire, but as the chip shop comes to life and old memories are stirred Harry and his family gradually discover that only when you lose everything are you free to discover it all.\n\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb42344715922b6b75461771e6fe4eb92b5abf39","amp;dn":"Papadopoulos+and+Sons+%282012%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb42344715922b6b75461771e6fe4eb92b5abf39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,66,52,71,21,146,43,107,117,70,23,113,230,254,78,185,43,90,191,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
