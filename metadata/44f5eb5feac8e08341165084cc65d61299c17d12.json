The radioactive waste in the world allows mutants to get ahead by mutating new limbs on the fly, the abundant availability of powerful weaponry make the quest to become ruler of the Wasteland one fraught with peril.\n\nUpdate 52 changelog:\nFeatures:\n- Craters &amp; tiny flames from explosions. Will still get some work in the future!\n- New Ultra Mutations for Horror, Steroids, Chicken, Rebel and Rogue.\n- Heavy Slugger.\nBalancing:\n- Higher rate of fire for Ultra and Heavy Revolvers.\n- More radiation gained from the Crown of Hatred.\n- Eagle Eyes no longer makes you see further. Didn't do too much and just made things more complicated than they should be.\nFixes:\n- Big Bandit spawns should be a lot more solid, and can no longer be used for radiation farming. Cool shortcut however.\n- Recoded the way radiation decides what to move towards.\n- Recoded Portal invincibility, now making you completely invulnerable to any damage. Might cause some problems with pickups that should be fixed soon.\n- Ultra Mutations can now be picked with the gamepad.\n- Windowed mode should have a border again.\n- Fixed a crash caused by boss spawns when playing with gamepad.\nMisc:\n- Golden Hammer is now the Golden Wrench.\n- Cars no longer die into tiny scorchmarks.\n- Lab now has tiny floor details.\n\nFull changelog: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nuclear-throne.wikia.com/wiki/Update_History&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nuclear-throne.wikia.com/wiki/Update_History&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVlambeer's twitch stream: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://twitch.tv/Vlambeer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://twitch.tv/Vlambeer&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it!       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nuclearthrone.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nuclearthrone.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/&lt;/a&gt;\t\nSupport the people whose products you like!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f5eb5feac8e08341165084cc65d61299c17d12","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Throne+%28Update+52%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f5eb5feac8e08341165084cc65d61299c17d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,245,235,95,234,200,224,131,65,22,80,132,204,101,214,18,153,193,125,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
