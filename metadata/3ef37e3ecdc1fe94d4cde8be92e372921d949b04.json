A 35-track selection of the best of Young's work between 1966 and 1976, it includes songs performed by Buffalo Springfield, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, and the Stills-Young Band, as well as solo work. In addition to five unreleased songs, Decade offers such key tracks as the Springfield's &quot;Mr. Soul,&quot; &quot;Broken Arrow,&quot; and &quot;I Am a Child&quot;; &quot;Sugar Mountain,&quot; a song that had appeared only as a single before; &quot;Cinnamon Girl,&quot; &quot;Down by the River,&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; from Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere; &quot;Southern Man&quot; and the title track from After the Gold Rush; and &quot;Old Man&quot; and the chart-topping &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; from Harvest. This is the material that built Young's reputation between 1966 and 1972, although he is more idiosyncratic with the later material, including the blockbusters &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot; but mixing in more unreleased recordings as the set draws to a close. He seems intent on making the album a listenable one that will appeal to a broad base of fans, and he succeeds despite the exclusion of much of the harrowing work of 1973-1975. Nevertheless, the album is an ideal sampler for new listeners, and since there is no one-disc Young compilation covering any significant portion of his career, this lengthy chronicle is the place to start.\nAll Music Review by William Ruhlmann\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Down To The Wire - - - Buffalo Springfield\n[02] Burned - - - Buffalo Springfield\n[03] Mr. Soul - - - Buffalo Springfield\n[04] Broken Arrow - - - Buffalo Springfield\n[05] Expecting To Fly - - - Buffalo Springfield\n[06] Sugar Mountain [Live] - - - Neil Young\n[07] I Am A Child - - - Buffalo Springfield\n[08] The Loner - - - Neil Young\n[09] The Old Laughing Lady - - - Neil Young\n[10] Cinnamon Girl - - - Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse\n[11] Down By The River - - - Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse\n[12] Cowgirl In The Sand - - - Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse\n[13] I Believe In You - - - Neil Young\n[14] After The Gold Rush  - - - Neil Young\n[15] Southern Man - - - Neil Young\n[16] Helpless - - - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\n\nPlay Time - 01h:13m:15s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Ohio - - - Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young\n[02] Soldier\n[03] Old Man\n[04] A Man Needs A Maid\n[05] Harvest\n[06] Heart Of Gold\n[07] Star Of Bethlehem\n[08] The Needle And The Damage Done\n[09] Tonight's The Night (Part 1)\n[10] Tired Eyes\n[11] Walk On\n[12] For The Turnstiles\n[13] Winterlong\n[14] Deep Forbidden Lake\n[15] Like A Hurricane\n[16] Love Is A Rose\n[17] Cortez The Killer - - - Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse\n[18] Campaigner\n[19] Long May You Run\n\nPlay Time - 01h:11m:01s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:24m:18s\nTotal File Size....................... 345mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
