She found wonderful ingredientsÃ¢â‚¬â€from local farmers and the neighboring woodsÃ¢â‚¬â€and, most important, time to cook. Her cookbook chronicles the familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seasonal meals and life in an old farmhouse, all photographed by her husband, Oddur. MimiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convivial recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as Roast Chicken with Herbs and CrÃƒÂ¨me FraÃƒÂ®che, CÃƒÂ¨pe and Parsley Tartlets, Winter Vegetable Cocotte, Apple Tart with Orange Flower Water, and Salted Butter CrÃƒÂ¨me CaramelÃ¢â‚¬â€will bring the warmth of rural France into your home.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/ddwxf6l11/mimi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/ddwxf6l11/mimi.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nBorn in Hong Kong to a French mother and Chinese father, Thorisson had previously worked as a journalist for CNN, and so the urge to keep writing was strong. Mimi Thorisson is a food blogger of Manger (http://mimithorisson.com). She lives with her photographer husband Odur &amp; six children (Tiger-Mia, 10, Hudson, 7, Louise, 5, GaÃƒÂ¯a, 2, together with her two step-children Gunnhildur, 16, and Thorir, 14). The pair first met by chance in Paris at a Fashion Week party. Oddur was based in Iceland at the time and Thorisson was working in television. They also share a great passion for dogs and count nearly 20 Jack Russells and smooth Fox Terriers in their brood.\n\nCONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION\nSPRING\nSUMMER\nAUTUMN\nWINTER\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nINDEX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f004b07cd784d445135569e10cd1c5166e3ee15a","amp;dn":"A+Kitchen+in+France+-+A+Year+of+Cooking+in+My+Farmhouse+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f004b07cd784d445135569e10cd1c5166e3ee15a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,4,176,124,215,132,212,69,19,85,105,225,12,209,197,22,110,62,225,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
