This visually magnificent and factually informative volume tells the story of graphic design, then gives separate illustrated thumbnail biographies of more than 100 of the most influential and internationally known designers of the past 100 years. From the century's early decades we find artists' profiles and reproductions from the studios of Peter Behrens, Alexander Rodchenko, the Bauhaus, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, a sampling of Art Deco, and much more. Examples of Mid-Century Modern include Lester Beall, Yusaku Kamekura, and jazz record covers from various sources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae76514a56c1dca7a628d847c0c9a6267deb63cd","amp;dn":"A+Century+of+Graphic+Design+-+Graphic+Design+Pioneers+of+the+20t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae76514a56c1dca7a628d847c0c9a6267deb63cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,118,81,74,86,193,220,167,166,40,216,71,192,201,166,38,125,235,99,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
