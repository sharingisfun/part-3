Gertrud Kanning, like the maid Joan in Dreyer's best-known film, La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc, is a woman in isolation. On the eve of her husband's appointment to a cabinet minister post, she announces that she is leaving their loveless marriage. But her younger lover Erland Jansson, a concert pianist, is more interested in keeping their affair illicit than in continuing it in the open. Gertrud's old lover, the poet Gabriel Lidman, offers more than his friendship, but she holds back from turning to him, instead choosing to live out her life in solitude rather than compromise with love again. Adapted from a 1920s play by Hjalmar Soberberg, Gertrud plays out in long takes, with few close-ups and exterior scenes. Though initial critical reaction to the film was largely unfavorable, its reputation has steadily grown, especially considered in the context of Dreyer's long career. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058138/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058138/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrud_%28film%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrud_%28film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nCarl Theodor Dreyer\n\n\n\n\tNina Pens Rode\t ... \tGertrud Kanning\n\tBendt Rothe\t... \tGustav Kanning\n\tEbbe Rode\t... \tGabriel Lidman\n\tBaard Owe\t... \tErland Jansson\n\n\nVideo\n      Format : xvid\n      Codec ID : xvid\n      Duration : 4h 25mn\n      Bit rate : 525 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.061\n      Stream size : 998 MiB (89%)\n   Audio\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 56mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 107 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 26 ms (0.78 video frame)\n      Writing library : LAME3.97\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:331edb926fa2319dc035709d718f37e047fbec1e","amp;dn":"Gertrud+%281964%29+Carl+Theodor+Dreyer+Ger%2CEng+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"331edb926fa2319dc035709d718f37e047fbec1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,30,219,146,111,162,49,157,192,53,112,157,113,143,55,224,71,251,236,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
