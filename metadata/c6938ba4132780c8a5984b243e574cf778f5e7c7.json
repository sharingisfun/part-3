Two of the biggest barriers to getting started are picking an automation tool and developing a framework for writing the tests. This course explores how to use the popular browser automation framework, Selenium, to create automated tests for web applications. We will examine using Selenium to directly record from within a Firefox browser, as well as using C# to automate the web browser using Selenium's API. We will also explore how to distribute tests over multiple machines using Selenium Server's grid capabilities. The course concludes with the implementation of a simple, maintainable framework for testing a web application using Selenium.\n\nfor more information\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/Description/selenium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/Description/selenium&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6938ba4132780c8a5984b243e574cf778f5e7c7","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+Automated+Web+Testing+with+Selenium+-+altaf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6938ba4132780c8a5984b243e574cf778f5e7c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,147,139,164,19,39,128,200,165,152,75,36,62,87,76,247,120,245,231,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
