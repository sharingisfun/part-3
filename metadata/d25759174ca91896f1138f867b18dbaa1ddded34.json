Roth's fiction, regularly set in Newark, New Jersey, is known for its intensely autobiographical character, for philosophically and formally blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, for its &quot;supple, ingenious style&quot; and for its provocative explorations of Jewish and American identity. His profile rose significantly in 1969 after the publication of the controversial Portnoy's Complaint, the humorous and sexually explicit psychoanalytical monologue of &quot;a lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor,&quot; filled with &quot;intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language.&quot;\n\nRoth is one of the most awarded U.S. writers of his generation: his books have twice received the National Book Award, twice the National Book Critics Circle award, and three times the PEN/Faulkner Award. He received a Pulitzer Prize for his 1997 novel, American Pastoral, which featured one of his best-known characters, Nathan Zuckerman, the subject of many other of Roth's novels. The Human Stain (2000), another Zuckerman novel, was awarded the United Kingdom's WH Smith Literary Award for the best book of the year. In 2001, Roth received the inaugural Franz Kafka Prize.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n\nNovels\n\n* Zuckerman\n\n- Zuckerman Bound\n   \n   + The Ghost Writer (1979)\n\n   + Zuckerman Unbound (1981)\n\n   + The Anatomy Lesson (1983)\n\n   + The Prague Orgy (1985)\n\n\n- The Counterlife (1986)\n\n- American Pastoral (1997)\n\n- I Married a Communist (1998)\n\n- The Human Stain (2000)\n\n- Exit Ghost (2007)\n\n\n* Kepesh\n\n- The Breast (1972)\n\n- The Professor of Desire (1977)\n\n- The Dying Animal (2001)\n\n\n* Other\n\n- Goodbye, Columbus (1959)\n\n- Letting Go (1962)\n\n- When She Was Good (1967)\n\n- Portnoy's Complaint (1969)\n\n- Our Gang (1971)\n\n- The Great American Novel (1973)\n\n- My Life as a Man (1974)\n\n- Operation Shylock: A Confession (1993)\n\n- Sabbath's Theater (1995)\n\n- The Plot Against America (2004)\n\n- Everyman (2006)\n\n- Indignation (2008)\n\n- The Humbling (2009)\n\n- Nemesis (2010)\n\n\n* Non-fiction\n\n- The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography (1988)\n\n\n* Collections\n\n- Reading Myself and Others (1976)\n\n- Shop Talk (2001)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Roth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Roth&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-open-letter-to-wikipedia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-open-letter-to-wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2957/the-art-of-fiction-no-84-philip-roth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2957/the-art-of-fiction-no-84-philip-roth&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/17/philip-roth-retires-imagine-interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/17/philip-roth-retires-imagine-interview&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/books/review/my-life-as-a-writer.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/books/review/my-life-as-a-writer.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d25759174ca91896f1138f867b18dbaa1ddded34","amp;dn":"Philip+Roth+-+Fiction+%26amp%3B+Non-Fiction+%2829+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d25759174ca91896f1138f867b18dbaa1ddded34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,87,89,23,76,169,24,150,241,19,143,134,123,24,219,170,29,221,237,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
