From his first ever tournament as a bluebelt\nto his Abu Dhabi tournament where he submitted Royler Gracie.\n\nEven do i personally think Eddie is a showboater, he stopped competing after he submitted a Gracie and that was really his only accoplishment. After he submitted Royler he practically pronounced himself as one of the greates grapplers of his time witch actually couldnt be more inaccurate. \n\nBut nevertheless this DVD is interresting and Eddie is also funny from time to time and not to forget, heÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s a legit pothead and he devoloped some of his best techniques when he was stoned.
