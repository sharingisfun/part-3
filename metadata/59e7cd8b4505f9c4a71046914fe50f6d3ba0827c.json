None of the videos or other interactive things will work on the PDF. I did try to make sure any stuff that was hidden behind buttons got shown, but I can't guarantee that everything in the EPub version will be there in the PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59e7cd8b4505f9c4a71046914fe50f6d3ba0827c","amp;dn":"Interaction+Design%3A+Beyond+Human-Computer+Interaction%2C+4th+Ed.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59e7cd8b4505f9c4a71046914fe50f6d3ba0827c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,231,205,139,69,5,249,196,167,16,70,145,79,229,15,109,59,160,130,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
