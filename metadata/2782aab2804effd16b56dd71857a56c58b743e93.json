includes 15 studio outtakes and a further 44 live BBC tracks to add to those already on Live at The BBC and On Air: Live at The BBC Volume 2, which was released earlier this year.\nThe 59 rare songs capture the Beatles during a fruitful period, the year they released their debut album With the Beatles. The harmonies are pristine and energetic, particularly on Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Taste of HoneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Saw Her Standing There.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ During Ã¢â‚¬Å“From Me to You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the band abruptly stops recording and McCartney says: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What happened? I just thought I heard you talking, actually.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lennon responds: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Did you whistle? heard a whistle.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ After a bit of sarcastic whistling, McCartney demands, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Come on,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the band resumes. They can also be heard bickering briefly on an early version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“One After 909.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLast month, music copyright was extended to 70 years. However, unreleased material only has 50 years of copyright protection. So anything recorded by the Beatles (and other artists) in 1963 and not yet in the public domain would automatically lose protection in 2014. By putting these old recordings out, however briefly and obscurely, Apple have now established copyright for the next 70 years.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2782aab2804effd16b56dd71857a56c58b743e93","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Bootleg+Recordings+1963+%282013%29+%5BiTunes%5D+M4AVBR+Beo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2782aab2804effd16b56dd71857a56c58b743e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,130,170,178,128,78,255,209,107,86,221,113,133,122,86,197,139,116,62,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
