What is x264? \n\n\nx264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!\n\n02. What is a .mkv file? \n\n\nMKV means &quot;matroska video&quot; and it is a &quot;extensible open standard Audio/Video container&quot; (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f29139f9f1c0cb5aa16ee89db6b6d7c14f499a","amp;dn":"Front+of+the+Class+%282008%29+-+DVDRip+-+x264+-+MKV+by+RiddlerA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f29139f9f1c0cb5aa16ee89db6b6d7c14f499a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,242,145,57,249,241,192,203,90,161,110,232,157,182,182,215,193,79,73,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
