The moment I realized this, my life underwent a small revolution. Now, not a day goes by in my own family when we arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t using it for a myriad of reasons.\n\nFrom minor infections to serious diseases, coconut oil cures it all. It does this in a completely delicious way, too! Coconut oil is one dose of Ã¢â‚¬Å“medicineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ no one in your family will hesitate to take, especially once theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned about the good itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing them.\n\nThroughout this book, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to open your eyes to these benefits. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s begin with the basics.\n\nWe know about some of the benefits from studying Pacific Islanders, for whom using coconut oil is a way of life. Research shows that the studied islanders were completely devoid of issues such as kidney disease, high cholesterol, and obesity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ issues we have come to accept as only being cured by pharmaceuticals. Yet regular consumption of coconut oil has shown that in fact the opposite is true.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to eat and digest coconut oil. In fact, ingesting coconut oil can be very cleansing to the colon. Coconut oil also helps to dissolve and remove toxins from the body. This helps those who ingest it to maintain ideal and healthy weights.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32cc0b4ce8ceb46289a183fa81e9902ac4fd666d","amp;dn":"Coconut+Oil+Cures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32cc0b4ce8ceb46289a183fa81e9902ac4fd666d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,204,11,76,232,206,180,98,137,161,131,250,129,233,144,42,196,253,102,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
