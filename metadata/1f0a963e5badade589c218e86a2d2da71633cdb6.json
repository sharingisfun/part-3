I did not create andy of these files. I believe that the keygen was created by tsrh. These files were all found  from various internet sources and personally tested by me. I give credit to whoever created these files, wherever they may be. These files have worked for me so they may hopefully work for you. Your mileage may vary.\n\n\nThe is a very good program and if you have the money you should buy it. I know if I had the money I would have bought it.\n\nUnfortunately for some of us that is not an option. This is for those people.\n\nThis is a very straight forward keygen but I have created instructions so that there is hopefully no confusion.\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Run and Install ROBOTCforMINDSTORMS_305.exe\n\n2. Disconnect from the internet\n\n2. Run RobotC\n\n3. Click the \\&quot;Help\\&quot; tab and click \\&quot;Manage Licenses\\&quot;\n\n4. Click \\&quot;Add License\\&quot;\n\n5. It will ask you if you would like to do an offline activation. Click \\&quot;Yes\\&quot;\n\n6. Run keygen.exe\n\n7. Copy and paste \\&quot;User Code 1\\&quot; and \\&quot;User Code 2\\&quot; into their respective boxes in the keygen\n\n8. Select the product in both the Keygen and RobotC\n\n9. Click \\&quot;Generate\\&quot; in the Keygen window\n\n10. Copy and past the generated \\&quot;Activation key 1\\&quot; and \\&quot;License ID\\&quot; from the Keygen into RobotC\n\n11. Click \\&quot;:Activate Offline\\&quot; in RobotC\n\n12. RobotC should accept the license without any question\n\n13. Restart RobotC\n\n14. Click the \\&quot;Help\\&quot; tab and click \\&quot;Manage Licenses\\&quot;\n\n15. If RobotC started without an activation message and you see a license listed as a \\&quot;Non-Expiring License\\&quot; you have succeeded\n\n16. You can now reconnect your internet.\n\nOnce again, if you have the means please buy the software. The people that make this are only trying to make a living and have been giving it away for free to many people until recently.\n\nI hope this works for those of you who need it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0a963e5badade589c218e86a2d2da71633cdb6","amp;dn":"RobotC+for+Lego+Mindstorms+3.04+%2B+Tsrh+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f0a963e5badade589c218e86a2d2da71633cdb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,10,150,62,91,173,173,229,137,194,24,232,106,45,45,167,22,51,205,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
