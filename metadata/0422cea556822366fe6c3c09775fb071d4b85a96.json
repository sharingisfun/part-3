He was a central member of Bloomsbury, but he also extended far beyond it, into every level of English society. Spalding sheds light on his love affairs with Lytton Strachey and Maynard Keynes, and on his tempestuous relationship with Vanessa Bell, with whom he lived at Charleston, and had a daughter, Angelica. Spalding also reassesses Grant's painting, setting it in the context of his fluctuating reputation, which dipped after World War II, but was followed by a revival of interest in his work by a younger audience in the late Sixties. He lived to be 93, his life spanning Victorian society and the modern day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0422cea556822366fe6c3c09775fb071d4b85a96","amp;dn":"Duncan+Grant+-+a+Biography+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0422cea556822366fe6c3c09775fb071d4b85a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,34,206,165,86,130,35,102,254,108,60,9,119,95,176,113,212,184,90,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
