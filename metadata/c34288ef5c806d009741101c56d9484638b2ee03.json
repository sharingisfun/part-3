The band been through various line-up changes since its formation in 1999. It has a dedicated fanbase, mostly in the UK. Its sound consists of passionate vocals set against heavy rock beats.\n\nTairrie B Murphy has cultivated a reputation both on and off the stage for her aggressive performances and acerbic vocal style. Steve Beebee of Kerrang! Magazine wrote: Ã¢â‚¬Å“On stage, she is hard to resist. Shaking, clawing at herself, falling to her knees, making eye contact with just about anyone brave enough, Tairrie B is undoubtedly a worthy star. It is her dangerous cocktail of defiance and vulnerability that makes it all seem so damn real.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ More recently, journalist Emma Johnston noted that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tairrie B doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so much open her heart to you as rip it still beating from a gaping wound in her chest before forcing the bloody mess down your throat,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a review for Classic Rock.\n\nOver the decade since the band's formation, the sound has evolved and become heavier with each record, with Mick MurphyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar playing becoming a prominent feature along with his solos and riffs. In a Metal Hammer Magazine album review praising the band's Ghosts and Good Stories album, journalist Dom Lawson stated: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The divine Ms. B comes roaring back under the radar and proudly grinding against the grain, My Ruin have mutated into something truly monstrous in recent years, as the chemistry between Tairrie B and Mick Murphy has evolved and sprouted wicked wings.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMick Murphy has also been praised in the music press over the years. In a live review from 2008, Mick was dubbed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Master of HeaviosityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and in 2009, Guitar Player Magazine wrote; Ã¢â‚¬Å“One of the most ferocious and creative hard rock guitarists youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear underground, above ground or bouncing off satellites.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n My Ruin The Sacred Mood\t\nCD, Released date : 11 June 2013 - Self-Released\nStyle: Hard Rock\n\n\n\t\n\nTracklist\n1.
