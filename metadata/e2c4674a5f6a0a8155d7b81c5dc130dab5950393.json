This shared earth approach enables companies to standardize workflows from exploration to productionÃ¢â‚¬â€and make more informed decisions with a clear understanding of both opportunities and risks. Updates by discipline are listed below.\n\nGeology\n\nPetroleum systems modelingÃ¢â‚¬â€Gain contextual understanding of the burial history, source rock maturation, hydrocarbon expulsion potential, and changes to properties over time in the reservoir and overburden, through 1D petroleum systems modeling.\nDeviated well correlationÃ¢â‚¬â€Accurately correlate deviated wells with seismic and models, including prestack data, and perform RC modeling in the well section.\nVolumetricsÃ¢â‚¬â€Generate accurate map-based volumetrics without the need for a 3D model.\nGeneral enhancementsÃ¢â‚¬â€Improved stratigraphic charts, map layering, time series logs, and more.\nGeophysics\n\nSalt interpretationÃ¢â‚¬â€Multi-Z interpretation and improved links with Omega seismic data processing software.\nStructural interpretationÃ¢â‚¬â€Augmented horizon autotracking and seismic reconstruction workflowÃ¢â‚¬â€with the ability to include multiple horizon typesÃ¢â‚¬â€allowing you to iteratively refine and validate the structural framework through interactive chronostratigraphic displays of seismic sections.\nStratigraphic interpretationÃ¢â‚¬â€Enhanced seismic illumination, visualization, and geobody extractionÃ¢â‚¬â€taking advantage of the latest rendering technology.\nGeneral enhancementsÃ¢â‚¬â€Improved 2D loading, multithreaded seismic calculator, composite lines on non-overlapping surveys, time variant wavelets, interval velocity maps, and more.\nGeological Modeling\n\nStructural modelingÃ¢â‚¬â€A new, volume-based modeling approach, supporting accurate representation of structural and depositional complexity.\nScenario modelingÃ¢â‚¬â€Improved uncertainty and scenario modeling beyond simple random parameter perturbation, enabled by updates to the workflow manager.\nProperty modelingÃ¢â‚¬â€multistructure datasets are now fully supported with the introduction of nested variograms; an essential element in accurately predicting properties away from known data points.\nDual-scale reservoir modeingÃ¢â‚¬â€This new reservoir model building workflow enables you to build linked geological and simulation models that contain the structural resolution and geological property resolution necessary to characterize the static and dynamic reservoir behavior.\nGeneral enhancementsÃ¢â‚¬â€Improved performance through parallelization, enhanced property and facies modeling, and more.\nReservoir Engineering\n\nAdvanced well handlingÃ¢â‚¬â€Import control data and apply status rules for sliding sleeve devices and flow control valves.\nField managementÃ¢â‚¬â€New region property list, as well as efficiency and usability improvements.\nINTERSECT connectionÃ¢â‚¬â€Improved support for INTERSECT workflows.\nGeneral enhancementsÃ¢â‚¬â€Additional keyword support, improved charting and analysis, greater control of capillary pressure and relative permeability functions, and more.\nProduction Geology\n\nProduction integrationÃ¢â‚¬â€Gain a greater understanding of how production relates to geology, with the introduction of well deliverability and production analytics functionality.\nDrilling\n\nGeomechanicsÃ¢â‚¬â€Greater understanding on drilling risk and well optimization with the introduction of two coupling for 3D and 4D Geomechanics.\nWell PlanningÃ¢â‚¬â€Data inspector for Well Design, for more interactive well planning in 3D context.\nStudio E&amp;P Knowledge Environment\n\nWeb map galleryÃ¢â‚¬â€Enables users to choose from a selection of predefined map services.\nFindÃ¢â‚¬â€Improved search functionality with more data sources, providing awareness of data across the enterprise. \nGIS integrationÃ¢â‚¬â€Enhanced use of GIS web map services with smart spatial filters and previews. \nConsolidated data administrationÃ¢â‚¬â€Studio Manager application for improved enterprise data management and support for Microsoft SQL server. \nData ManagementÃ¢â‚¬â€Updated ESRI Projection Engine and a utility to facilitate better management of corporate CRS definitions\nCross discipline\n\nUnified helpÃ¢â‚¬â€provides unified access to help and documentation. \nEase of useÃ¢â‚¬â€Updated window scheme and icons, changes in the way the data tree synchronizes with actions in the display window, and more interaction with the data through heads-up data inspectors added throughout. \nPerformanceÃ¢â‚¬â€Significant performance improvements for point and polygon rendering, large model handling, high well counts, and project startup. \nStandardize your workflows\n\nThe breadth and depth of the Petrel platform enables E&amp;P companies to deploy standardized software workflows from exploration to production. The key is integrating disciplines from petroleum systems modeling through to production analysis on a single platform, while maintaining extensibility with third-party plug-ins or propriety technology.\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to standardization, the Petrel platform is delivered in a regular structured update process. This efficient access to new capabilities allows you to proactively plan your deployment procedure.Ã¢â‚¬â€¹","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2c4674a5f6a0a8155d7b81c5dc130dab5950393","amp;dn":"Schlumberger+Petrel+2013.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2c4674a5f6a0a8155d7b81c5dc130dab5950393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,196,103,74,95,106,10,129,85,215,184,28,93,193,48,218,181,149,3,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
