Written for men and women, straight and gay, the book graphically, playfully, and sensually discusses the best hand and body positions, the enticements of teasing and begging, and the subtle intricacies of peaking and coming down. It also reveals little-known erogenous zones, giving specific information on the sensitivity of each area. While Extended Massive Orgasm focused on female pleasure, the authors have devoted 50 percent of this book to techniques for men. The book includes a Q&amp;A section along with the extensive drawings and photographs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c70ad236b49c4c9125547fd15c46a1fad68e0fda","amp;dn":"++The+Illustrated+Guide+to+Extended+Massive+Orgasm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c70ad236b49c4c9125547fd15c46a1fad68e0fda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,10,210,54,180,156,76,145,37,84,127,209,92,70,161,250,214,142,15,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
