In fact, if you show this to a child, he or she will most likely have nightmares for weeks. It's a very disturbing and graphic story for an animation, especially considering that it is 35 years old. The blu-ray version has not even been released yet in the United States, but I was able to get a source of the German release which is already out. Don't worry - it's still in English. They merely added a second selectable audio track for the German release\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8c8a5a10aad410432ae6d490071f718c9cb4ebb","amp;dn":"Watership+Down+%281978%29+%5B720p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8c8a5a10aad410432ae6d490071f718c9cb4ebb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,200,165,161,10,173,65,4,50,174,109,73,0,113,247,24,201,203,78,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
