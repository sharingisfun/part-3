Neil Browne (Author), Daniel Herron (Author), Lucien Dhooge (Author), Linda Barkacs (Author)\nPaperback: 688 pages\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill/Irwin; 2 edition (January 5, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0073524972\nISBN-13: 978-0073524979\nNOTE: This is the standalone ebook and may not include access codes that come packaged with the bound book\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Business Law: The Essentials is appropriate for the one-semester Business Law course. It contains the basics of business law but does not get bogged down in the kind of details that are more appropriate in an upper-level law class. The text provides an examination of the basic questions, concepts, and legal rules of business law.\nEmphasis on the BUSINESS in business law. Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials emphasizes the tie of legal issues back to the core business curriculum. This will help both students and faculty. Faculty need to know how this is integrated as they are constantly Ã¢â‚¬ËœdefendingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the inclusion of this course in the business curriculum. And students need to understand how the concepts tie to their future business careers.\n\nEmphasis on TEACHING. Many professors teaching this course are attorneys first and academics second. They do not have a lot of time to prepare or think about how to apply this information effectively for their business students. Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials contains a helpful instructorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manual, particularly for the many adjuncts teaching this course.\n\nEmphasis on CRITICAL THINKING. Neil Browne, one of the co-authors of this text, has written a successful text on critical thinking. His framework is included in Dynamic Business Law: The Essentials as well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to help students learn how to frame and reframe a question/issue. Critical thinking questions are also included at the end of each case, to tie in this component even further","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c41535d7eee6be2670f65c60e0e3dc42246ce6","amp;dn":"Dynamic+Business+Law%2C+The+Essentials%2C+3E+Kubasek+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c41535d7eee6be2670f65c60e0e3dc42246ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,196,21,53,215,238,230,190,38,112,246,92,96,224,227,220,66,36,108,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
