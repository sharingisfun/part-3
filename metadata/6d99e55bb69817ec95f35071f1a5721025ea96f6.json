They compose a new kind of world music, sometimes called ethnic electronica, mixing ethnic with electronic sounds and dance beats or chillout beats. Their sound has been described as an &quot;ethno-introspective ambient world music&quot;. They were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1993 for Best World Music Album, and in 1996 they won the Award for the album Boheme. The group also became World Music Awards Winner - French group with the highest 1995 world sales. Their albums have sold over 10 million copies.\n\nOfficial website of the Group:\nhttp://www.deepforestmusic.com/\n\n---\n\nAlbums (6 CD`s; all in mp3; CBR; 320 kb/s):\n\n1992 - Deep Forest (mp3; CBR; 320 kb/s)\n\nFormat: \tAlbum \nRelease Date: \t1992\nCatalog #: \tDance Pool  DAN 471976 2 (Australia, CD)\n\t\n\tCeline Music / Synsound CK 90933 (Canada, CD)\n\t\n\nDeep Forset's debut album composed by Michel Sanchez &amp; Eric Mouquet, produced and mixed by Dan Lacksman at his Snynsound Studios in Belgium. The album utilized archived African ethnographical recordings, which were cut up, looped, and mixed with modern dance beats creating an international phenomenon and a new style of music. Deep Forest sold over 2 million copies worldwide and was nominated for a grammy award for best world musc album. Five of the songs were released as singles, but it was the Sweet Lullaby taken from the Solomon Islands which was by far the most successful. The Sweet Lullaby video directed by Tarsem Singh was nominated for best music video of the year by MTV. Due to the growing success of the album it was re-released in 1994 under the name World Mix, with the addition of 4 remixes.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDeep Forest   5:34\nSweet Lullaby   3:54\nHunting   3:27\nNight Bird   4:18\nThe First Twilight   3:18\nSavana Dance   4:26\nDesert Walk   5:14\nWhite Whisper   5:46\nThe Second Twilight   3:02 (1:24, US)\nSweet Lullaby (Ambient Mix)   3:44\n\n*\n\n1994 - World Mix (mp3; CBR; 320 kb/s)\n\nFormat: \tCD Album \nRelease Date: \t1994\nCountry : \tAustralia\nLabel: \tColumbia\nCatalog #: \tCOL 476589 9\n\nTracklist:\nNotes: \tDigipak Book \t\n\nDeep Forest   5:34\nSweet Lullaby   3:54\nMain vocals by Afunakwa (Northern Malaita, Solomon Islands)\nHunting   3:27\nNight Bird   4:18\nThe First Twilight   3:18\nSavana Dance   4:26\nDesert Walk   5:14\nWhite Whisper   5:46\nThe Second Twilight   3:02\nSweet Lullaby (Ambient Mix)   3:44\nSweet Lullaby (Round the World Mix)   6:48\nRemixed by Pete Arden.

This time around instead of relying solely on recordings, Deep Forest invited musicians like Marta Sebestyen and Katalin Szvorak to their studios in France so that they could work with them live. Dan Lacksman left the project, wanting to keep the music more studio oriented, and in 1996 released his own Deep Forest-like album Pangea.\n\nThe result of Eric and Michel's endevor is a darker and more mysterious sound. An early version of Martha's Song (Martha) was used in the French film Pret-A-Porter and was the first song to be heard from the second album. Boheme was released several months later and was again internationally acclaimed. Over 1 million copies of Boheme were sold as well as winning a grammy for best world music album. \n\nFormat: \tAlbum\nRelease Date: \t1995\n\tSeptember 30, 1996 (Australia)\n\t\nCatalog #: \tEpic 478623 2 (Australia, CD)\n\t\n\tColumbia 789.095/2-478623(Brazil, CD)\n\nTracklist:\nAnasthasia   1:48\nBohemian Ballet   5:15\nMarta's Song   4:13\nPerformed by Marta Sebestyen.\nGathering   4:39\nLament   3:09\nBulgarian Melody   3:09\nPerformed by Marta Sebestyen\nDeep Folk Song   1:13\nFreedom Cry   3:17\nTwosome   4:06\nPerformed by Katalin Szvorak and Marta Sebestyen\nCafe Europa   4:17\nPerformed by Franck A.

Michel traveled to Cuba to record the street musicians (known as a comparsa, also means partner) and meet new artists, while Eric flew to Madagascar.\n\nThe third album returned to the rhythm and dance of the debut release but with a much more elborate weave of textures and instruments, and plenty of accordian. The project became even more of a live thing, with a long list of guests including Wes Madiko, Ana Torroja, Abed AzriÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, Jorge Reyes, Gilles Cagin, Joe Zawinul and Vetse.\n\nComparsa sold 500,000 copies, and was released around the world including in Japan.\n\nFormat: \tAlbum \nRelease Date: \t1998\n\t\nCatalog #: \tSony SAN 488725 2 (Europe, CD)\n\t\n\tSony 488725 3 (Europe, Cassette)\n\t\nTracklist:\nNoonday Sun   4:59\nPerformed by Madame Sana.

The French film Prince du la Pacifique is directed by Alain Corneau, and takes place during 1914 in Tahiti.\n\nEric and Michel were flown out to Tahiti where the film was being shot so that they could gather music material. Once there they met with a local musician who intruduced them to a number of Tahitian musicians. Deep Forest was under sharp time restraints and began composing immediately. The style is a bit more electronic than their other works, and is composed with the film imagery in mind rather than as a stand alone album.\n\nFormat:   \tAlbum \t  \t\nRelease Date: \tNovember 28, 2000\nCountry:  \tFrance\nLabel:   \tSony Music / St George\nCatalog #:   \tSAN 501241 2 (CD)\n\nTracklist:\nPacifique   3:46\nIncludes traditional Fare Mori chants / Sung by the choir of Paparai of Tahiti\nLa lÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©gende part 2   4:04\nIncludes traditional chants with extracts from the original soundtrack of the film / Sung by the choir of Tefareii of Huahine\nNight Village   4:10\nLe rÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©veil de BarnabÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© part 1   1:07\nLa rÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©volte   4:27\nLe baiser   2:29\nOuverture HuahinÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©   5:06\nL'lle Invisible   1:45\nLa lÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©gende part 1   0:46\nIncludes traditional chants with extracts from the original soundtrack of the film\nExÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©cution   4:26\nLe rÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©veil de BarnabÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© part 2   3:20\nMoon Light   3:21\nTÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©faora ne croit pas ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ la lÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©gende   1:10\nLa veuve furieuse   3:34\nHuahinÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© reggae   6:01\n\n*\n\n2002 - Music Detected (mp3; CBR; 320 kb/s)\n\nEric and Michel had initially planned this Asian themed album for their third release instead of Comparsa. While working on Music Detected several things happened, one being the attack on the World Trade Center, causing Deep Forest to change the direction of the music. The fourth album was very different from any of their previous music. There were now rock elements like live drums and electric guitars, and English lyrics with an emphasis on the environment. Although there were a number of Asian musicians involved, the album was less regionally and traditionally focused as compared to the first three studio albums.\n\nAlabaman blues-rock singer Beverly Jo Scott appears on four songs and was a big influence on the new rock sound. From Asia there is Anggun, Chitose Hajime, Mahalakshmi Iyer and Taro Hakase each with their own song.\n\nFormat:  \tCD Album \nRelease Date: \tJune, 2002 (Europe)\nJune 5, 2002 (Canada)\nJuly 30, 2002 (US)\nCatalog #: \tSony / Saint George SAN 506355 2 (Europe)\n\t\n\tColumbia CK 91658 (Canada)\n\nTracklist:\nIndia   4:07\nVocals: Mahalakshmi Iyer \tViolin: Cecile Sanchez\nDrums: David Fall \tKeyboards: Eric Mouquet, Michel Sanchez\nGuitar: Phillipe Paradis\nEndangeredSpecies   6:18\nAdd.

It was their first experience bringing Deep Forest to the stage. The following year Michel and Eric gathered a large ensemble of musicians and went on a world tour visiting Europe, Australia and Japan, proving they could fully translate their studio project into a live show.\n\nIn 1998 after the completion of Comparsa, Deep Forest once again prepared to hit the road. Initially they had planned a large tour across the United States, but due to unknown complications the US tour was cancelled and Deep Forest instead performed mainly in Japan. Their performance at Tokyo's Koseinenkin Hall on September 9th, 1998 would capture just the right atmosphere. A recording of this concert was released a year later on Made in Japan.\n\nFormat:    \tCD Album  \t   \tMade in Japan, Cover\nRelease Date: \tNov 15, 1999 (Europe)\nOct 26, 1999 (USA)\n  \t \nCatalog #: \tSaint George / Sony  SAN 494636 2 (Europe)\n\nTracklist:\nEkue Ekue   5:17\nGreen And Blue   6:00\nDeep Weather   6:19\nBohemian Ballet   6:15\nDeep Folk Song   2:25\nFreedom Cry   4:06\nCafe Europa   4:47\nForest Power   6:07\nHunting   6:37\nForest Hymn   5:23\nSweet Lullaby   6:22\nMadazulu   4:57\n\n*\n\n2004 - Essence of the forest (Best Of) (mp3; CBR; 320 kb/s)\n\n\n(2004)\nEssence of the Forest Cover (Europe, Asia, Australia &amp; Canada)\nEurope, Asia &amp; Canada\n\n\t\nIn early 2004 the 'Best of' album was release in Europe, Canada and the rest of Asia.
