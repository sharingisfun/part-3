Do not connect your phone before installing Phoenix software.\n\n2.

Be sure you install updated firmware. You cannot downgrade your\nphones firmware in BB5 phones which includes all new Nokia\nphones including N-Series.\n\n5. Phoenix allows downgrading but your phone doesnt allow it as your phone has some special security built into it. \nSo no use of trying it. Youll get an error message.\n\n6.

It can also sometimes solve little issues.\nI revived my &quot;Dead Phone&quot;.\n\n7.Scout the web for latest firmware for your specific phone.\n\nFlashing Procedure [Updating to latest firmware]:\n\n1.
