Spec Ops: The Line unfolds within the destroyed opulence of Dubai. \nOnce the playground for the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealthiest elite, Dubai has fallen victim \nto a series of cataclysmic sandstorms. The cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultramodern architecture lies \nhalf-buried under millions of tons of sand. The very sand that blankets the city \nplays a marquee role in altering combat situations and serves as a powerful but \nunpredictable force that will both help and hinder players throughout the course \nof the game. While most people have fled the now-barren wasteland before the \nsandstorms swept through, U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad and his loyal squad \nremained behind to protect those incapable of escape. Unable to reach anyone in \nDubai after the storm hit, the U.S. Army feared Konrad and his team dead until \nthey picked up a weak distress signal and launched a rescue operation. As U.S. \nArmy Captain Martin Walker, you and your elite Delta Force team are sent to \ninfiltrate the treacherous region to bring Konrad home. Players will experience \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The LineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, that razorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s edge known only to men who deal in war. It is the line \nthey cross when death and duty become one and the same. It is the end Ã¢â‚¬â€ of self \nand sanity Ã¢â‚¬â€ when their duty is done and only they remain.\n\n\nPlatform: XBOX360\nRegion: Region Free\nFormat: XGD3\nSize: 1 DVD\nLanguage: English\nGenre: Shooter\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-4190_4FE54F26.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-4190_4FE54F26.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-F03F_4FE54F26.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-F03F_4FE54F26.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-65C5_4FE54F26.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-65C5_4FE54F26.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-5AE1_4FE54F26.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freeimage.us/image-5AE1_4FE54F26.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:758c29acb8ae36ed45f51437d29c13441556db78","amp;dn":"Spec+Ops+The+Line+XBOX360-iMARS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"758c29acb8ae36ed45f51437d29c13441556db78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,140,41,172,184,174,54,237,69,245,20,55,210,156,19,68,21,86,219,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
