The visuals have been given a letterboxed transfer in the film's original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for 16 x 9 monitors), and the original Spanish language audio has been mastered in Dolby Digital 5.1. There's also an alternate audio track with the interview segments dubbed into French in Dolby Digital Stereo. Optional Spanish subtitles have been included, and the disc also includes several bonus features: a commentary track from Latin jazz authority Nat Chediak, an additional documentary on the history and background of Latin jazz, biographies and discographies on the musicians featured, and the picture's original theatrical trailer. The superb quality of the disc's DVD audio would be enough reason for many jazz fans to pick up this edition of Calle 54, but the strength of the film and the quality of the additional material makes it a must for anyone with a passion for Latin music at its best.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n    * Audio commentary with associate producer and Latin Jazz historian Nat Chediak [English and Spanish versions]\n    * Documentary on the history of Latin Jazz\n    * Theatrical trailer\n    * English subtitles\n    * Spanish subtitles\n    * Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound\n    * Widescreen [1.85:1] enhanced for 16x9 televisions\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.calle54film.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.calle54film.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c16b26523838d89adea816e14f0660570c8397","amp;dn":"Calle+54+%2854th+Street%29+-+Documentary+on+Latin+Jazz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c16b26523838d89adea816e14f0660570c8397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,193,107,38,82,56,56,216,154,222,168,22,225,79,6,96,87,12,131,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
