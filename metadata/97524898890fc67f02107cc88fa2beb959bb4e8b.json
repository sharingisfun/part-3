Betrayed and left for dead, Lo Wang learns of the bladeâ€™s connection to ancient gods from another realm preparing to push our world to the brink of destruction. Now the reluctant hero must become legend through a masterful combination of gun, blade, magic and wit to uncover the truth behind the demonic invasion and banish evil back into the darkness.\r\n\r\nShadow Warrior is a bold reimagining of the classic 3D Realmsâ€™ shooter from independent developer Flying Wild Hog (Hard Reset) starring the legendary and quick-witted warrior Lo Wang. Combine the brute force of overwhelming firepower with the elegant precision of a katana to annihilate the merciless armies of the shadow realm in an exhilarating and visually stunning transformation of the classic first-person shooter.\r\n\r\nIncludes the GOG.com exclusive classic Shadow Warrior katana!\r\nExcellent mini-game â€“ After the battle's over, why not clean up the mess you made in Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior?

Each weapon offers several unique upgrades to increase power, speed, and add devastating alternative firing options.\r\nMystical Powers â€“ Call upon mystical powers to protect yourself and paralyze your enemies or use their own severed heads and still-beating hearts to bring them to their knees","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97524898890fc67f02107cc88fa2beb959bb4e8b","amp;dn":"Shadow+Warrior+%282013%29+%28v2.0.0.1-v2.2.0.1%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97524898890fc67f02107cc88fa2beb959bb4e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,82,72,152,137,15,198,127,2,16,124,200,143,162,190,185,89,187,78,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
