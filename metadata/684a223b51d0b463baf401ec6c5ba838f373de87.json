It was written by Alex Ross and Mark Waid and painted in gouache by Ross, who also developed the concept from an original idea. Set some twenty years into the future of the then-current DC Universe, it deals with a growing conflict between &quot;traditional&quot; superheroes, such as Superman, Wonder Woman, and the Justice League, and a growing population of largely amoral and dangerously irresponsible new vigilantes. Between these two groups is Batman and his assembled team, who attempt to contain the escalating disaster, foil the machinations of Lex Luthor, and prevent a world-ending superhuman war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:684a223b51d0b463baf401ec6c5ba838f373de87","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Come+DC+cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"684a223b51d0b463baf401ec6c5ba838f373de87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,74,34,59,81,208,180,99,186,244,1,236,108,91,168,56,243,115,222,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
