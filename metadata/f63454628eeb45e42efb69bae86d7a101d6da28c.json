Morgenstern classic, The Princess Bride. But as a grown-up he discovered that the boring parts were left out of good old Dad's recitation, and only the &quot;good parts&quot; reached his ears.\n\nNow Goldman does Dad one better. He's reconstructed the &quot;Good Parts Version&quot; to delight wise kids and wide-eyed grownups everywhere.\n\nWhat's it about? Fencing. Fighting. True Love. Strong Hate. Harsh Revenge. A Few Giants. Lots of Bad Men. Lots of Good Men. Five or Six Beautiful Women. Beasties Monstrous and Gentle. Some Swell Escapes and Captures. Death, Lies, Truth, Miracles, and a Little Sex.\n\nIn short, it's about everything","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f63454628eeb45e42efb69bae86d7a101d6da28c","amp;dn":"Princess+Bride%2C+The+-+William+Goldman-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f63454628eeb45e42efb69bae86d7a101d6da28c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,52,84,98,142,235,69,228,46,251,105,186,232,109,122,16,29,109,162,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
