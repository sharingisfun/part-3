It takes 10 billion years for the ideal planet to form and 3 billion more for the right conditions to emerge before it finally happens: mankind begins. From there unfolds a fast-paced story told here through key turning points-stepping stones in our journey from hunter-gatherer to global citizen. It's a tale of connections-why some ideas take hold and spread around the globe, and how the lives of people in one part of the world are shaped by events in another. Episodes covered throughout the series include the ice age, the advent of farming, the sacking of Rome, the discovery of the New World, the fall of the Aztec empire, the Industrial Revolution and so much more. This is our story-a story of triumph and overcoming, of survival on a harsh and brutal planet. It is the story of all of-and how, against the odds, we survived. Mankind is the first television series in a generation to tackle the history of the human race through the ages. Embracing groundbreaking storytelling methods, it features jaw-dropping imagery and dramatic reconstructions of the most critical events in human history.\n\n\n\n\n8)  Treasure \nIn the Andes, the Spanish open up the largest silver mine in the world - and mint millions of pesos de ocho (pieces of eight). These coins transform the global economy. They fill the treasure chests of pirates. They fuel a stock market boom. They help pay for the Taj Mahal. As trade booms, millions of people come to the New World as slaves. But a handful of Pilgrims come as pioneers - looking for freedom.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg http://img600.imageshack.us/img600/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg http://img560.imageshack.us/img560/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/4669/mankindthestoryofallofu.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1930 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 23\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 47mins\n * Number Of Parts: 12\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.history.co.uk/shows/mankind.html\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e00607383796f79bf0847290ca6d93da04d5ea96","amp;dn":"History.Ch.Mankind.The.Story.of.All.of.Us..08of12.Treasure.DVDri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e00607383796f79bf0847290ca6d93da04d5ea96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,6,7,56,55,150,247,155,240,132,114,144,202,109,147,218,4,213,234,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
