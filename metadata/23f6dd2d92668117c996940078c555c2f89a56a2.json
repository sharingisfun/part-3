We explore how the journalists come to realise how much the war strategy has been mismanaged by those in command and how little information is being communicated back to the British and Australian governments about the true state of the campaign.\n\nAs the atrocities, defeat and horror mount, the journalists are subjected to tough and often bizarre levels of censorship. Unable to report the truth they nevertheless must witness it.\n\nCast: Sam Worthington, Hugh Dancy, Joel Jackson, Rachel Griffiths &amp; Bryan Brown\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 20-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f6dd2d92668117c996940078c555c2f89a56a2","amp;dn":"Deadline.Gallipoli.Part.2.HDTV.x264-Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f6dd2d92668117c996940078c555c2f89a56a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,246,221,45,146,102,129,23,201,150,148,0,120,197,85,194,248,154,86,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
