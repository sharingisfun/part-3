They are of fairly good quality.  I definitly didn't have any trouble with them.  \n\nI must insist that these books are fantastic.  &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; should be compulsory reading in all high schools.  The rest of them are so anecdotally delightful that they are nearly irrestible.  It doesn't really matter what order you go through them, but I suggest &quot;The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid&quot; before &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;.  That way you get an introduction to Steven Katz.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85cf7a6048ea74cf955180334f79880e2be45623","amp;dn":"A+Nearly+Complete+Bill+Bryson+%2810+Audiobooks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85cf7a6048ea74cf955180334f79880e2be45623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,207,122,96,72,234,116,207,149,81,128,51,79,121,136,14,43,228,86,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
