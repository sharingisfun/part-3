These are the cars that fill the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest collections, like those of Ralph Lauren, Mark Knopfler, and various members of royal families. These are the cars from historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premiere automakers: hallowed names like Packard, Duesenberg, Stutz, Bugatti, Mercedes-Benz, Cord, and othersÃ¢â‚¬â€six-figure and million-dollar machines that thrill Barrett-Jackson audiences and drive bidders to frenzy.
