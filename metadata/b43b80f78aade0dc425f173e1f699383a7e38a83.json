She is widely known for originating the roles of Maureen in Rent and Elphaba in Wicked.\n\nMenzel was born in Queens, New York, New York. Her mother, Helene, is a therapist, and her father, Stuart Mentzel, worked as a pajama salesman. She was raised in Syosset, New York, with her younger sister Cara, and later changed her last name to Menzel to better reflect the pronunciation the Mentzel family had adopted in America. When Menzel was 15 years old, her parents divorced and she began working as a wedding and bar mitzvah singer, a job which she continued throughout her time at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She earned a Bachelors of Fine Arts degree in Drama at NYU prior to being cast in Jonathan Larson's rock musical Rent. She was friends with actor Adam Pascal before they worked together in Rent.\n\nTheatre career\n\nIn 1995, Menzel auditioned for Rent, which became her first professional theater job and her Broadway debut. Rent opened off-Broadway at the New York Theatre Workshop on January 26, 1996, but it moved to Broadway's Nederlander Theatre due to its popularity. For her performance as Maureen Johnson in the original cast of the musical, Menzel received a Tony nomination as Best Featured Actress in a Musical. Her final performance in the musical was on July 1, 1997.\n\nFollowing the success of Rent, Menzel released her first solo album entitled Still I Can't Be Still on Hollywood Records, Menzel also originated the role of Dorothy in Summer of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢42 at Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut, starred as Sheila in the New York City Center Encores! production of Hair and appeared on Broadway as Amneris in Aida.

The series is in development and is hopeful to be picked up for the Fall 2011 television season.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTrack listing\n\nStill I Can't Be Still (1998)\n\n   1. &quot;Minuet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n   2. &quot;Larissa's Lagoon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n   3. &quot;Follow If You Lead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n   4. &quot;All of the Above&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n   5. &quot;Still I Can't Be Still&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n   6. &quot;Think Too Much&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n   7. &quot;Planet Z&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n   8. &quot;Fool Out of Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n   9. &quot;Reach&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n  10. &quot;Straw Into Gold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n  11. &quot;Heart on My Sleeve&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:20\n\nI Stand (2008)\n\n1. \t&quot;I Stand&quot;   \t  \t3:40\n2. \t&quot;Better to Have Loved&quot;   \t  \t3:58\n3. \t&quot;Brave&quot;   \t  \t4:39\n4. \t&quot;Gorgeous&quot;   \tMenzel, Dave Bassett \t3:48\n5. \t&quot;Where Do I Begin&quot;   \t  \t3:27\n6. \t&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;   \tPeter-John Vettese, James Blunt \t3:43\n7. \t&quot;I Feel Everything&quot;   \t  \t3:12\n8. \t&quot;Forever&quot;   \tMenzel \t3:53\n9. \t&quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot;   \t  \t4:34\n10. \t&quot;Perfume and Promises&quot;   \tMenzel, Vettese \t3:40","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b43b80f78aade0dc425f173e1f699383a7e38a83","amp;dn":"Idina+Menzel+-+2+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b43b80f78aade0dc425f173e1f699383a7e38a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,59,128,247,138,173,224,220,66,95,23,62,31,105,147,131,167,227,138,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
