In Practical AVR Microcontrollers, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to use the AVR microcontroller to make your own nifty projects and gadgets.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start off with the basics in part one: setting up your development environment and learning how the Ã¢â‚¬Å“nakedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ AVR differs from the Arduino. Then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll gain experience by building a few simple gizmos and learning how everything can be interconnected.\n\nIn part two, we really get into the goodies: projects! Each project will show you exactly what software and hardware you need, and will provide enough detail that you can adapt it to your own needs and parts availability. Some of the projects youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make:\n\n- An illuminated secret panel\n- A hallway lighting system with a waterfall effect\n- A crazy lightshow\n- Visual effects gizmos like a Moire wheel and shadow puppets\n\nIn addition, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll design and implement some home automation projects, including working with wired and wireless setups. Along the way, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll design a useable home automation protocol and look at a variety of hardware setups.\n\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to electronics, or you just want to see what you can do with an AVR outside of an Arduino, Practical AVR Microcontrollers is the book for you.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- How programming the AVR is different from programming an Arduino\n- How to use the Arduino IDE to program the AVR, and when to use AVR Studio\n- How to network your AVR devices and use them in home automation\n- How to add intelligence to your AVR devices\n- How to make games with AVR\n\nWho this book is for\nBeginning electronics enthusiasts as well as Arduino fans who want to go beyond the Arduino with the AVR microcontroller.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: The Basics\nChapter 1.
