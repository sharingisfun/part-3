This anthology takes the listener from Honolulu to Nashville, via Hollywood, a musical excursion replete with vitality and swing. \n\nThe path traced by this volume's subtitleÃ¢â‚¬â€œHonolulu, Hollywood, NashvilleÃ¢â‚¬â€œfollows the steel guitar's expanding popularity beyond Hawaii's shores. The group of musicians active in Hollywood filmmaking in the 1930s include Andy Iona, Sol Ho'poi'i and Sam Koki. Nashville marks the steel guitar's crossover into what eventually came to be known as ''country &amp; western'' music.\n\nDisc 1\t\n01. Sol Hoopii - Farewell Blues\n02. Frank Ferera - Maui\n03.
