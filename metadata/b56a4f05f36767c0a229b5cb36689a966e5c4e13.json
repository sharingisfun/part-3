Though their music was initially categorised as progressive \nrock, they have since incorporated a combination of traditional rock and art rock into \ntheir music. The band's work is marked by the inventive songwriting of Rick Davies and \nRoger Hodgson, the distinctive voice of Hodgson, and the prominent use of Wurlitzer \nelectric piano and saxophone in their songs.\n\n\n\n  01.
