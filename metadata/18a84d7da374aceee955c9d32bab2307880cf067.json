Did you know they tried to anchor Zeppelins at the top of the Empire State Building? Or that the high-rent district of Park Avenue was once so dangerous it was called â€œDeath Avenueâ€? Lively and comprehensive, Inside the Apple brings to life New Yorkâ€™s fascinating past.\r\n\r\nThis narrative history of New York City is the first to offer practical walking tour know-how. Fast-paced but thorough, its bite-size chapters each focus on an event, person, or place of historical significance. Rich in anecdotes and illustrations, it whisks readers from colonial New Amsterdam through Manhattanâ€™s past, right up to post-9/11 New York. The book also works as a historical walking-tour guide, with 14 self-guided tours, maps, and step-by-step directions. Easy to carry with you as you explore the city, Inside the Apple allows you to visit the site of every story it tells. This energetic, wide-ranging, and often humorous book covers New Yorkâ€™s most important historical moments, but is always anchored in the city of today.\r\n\r\nInside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City by Michelle Nevius, James Nevius\r\nEnglish | ISBN: 141658997X | 2009 | PDF/EPUB | 384 pages | 6.30 MB/6.40 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18a84d7da374aceee955c9d32bab2307880cf067","amp;dn":"Inside+the+Apple+-+A+Streetwise+History+of+New+York+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18a84d7da374aceee955c9d32bab2307880cf067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,168,77,125,163,116,172,238,233,85,201,211,43,171,35,7,136,12,240,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
