And the dedicated priest who runs the struggling home stands accused. But despite damning evidence that heâ€™s a killerâ€”and worseâ€”Father Thomas Martin stands by his innocence. And attorney Peter Donley stands with him.\r\nFor three years Donley has cut his legal teeth in his uncleâ€™s tiny, no-frills firm, where people come before profits. Just as Donley is poised to move on to a lucrative dream job, the shocking case lands in his lap, and he must put his future on hold while putting his courtroom skills to the test. But a ruthless DA seeking headlines and a brutal homicide cop bent on vengeance have their own agendas. Now, as he unearths the dirty secrets surrounding the case, Donley must risk his neck to save his clientâ€™s lifeâ€¦and expose the face of true evil.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e41b5e38004f5d902d18a3c954f6b6b9be291c0","amp;dn":"The+7th+Canon+-+Robert+Dugoni+%5BEN+EPUB+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e41b5e38004f5d902d18a3c954f6b6b9be291c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,65,181,227,128,4,245,217,2,209,138,60,149,79,107,107,155,226,145,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
