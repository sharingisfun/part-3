The challenges include capture, curation, storage, search, sharing, transfer, analysis, and visualization. The trend to larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing correlations to be found to &quot;spot business trends, determine quality of research, prevent diseases, link legal citations, combat crime, and determine real-time roadway traffic conditions.&quot;\n\nBig data is difficult to work with using most relational database management systems and desktop statistics and visualization packages, requiring instead &quot;massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers&quot;. What is considered &quot;big data&quot; varies depending on the capabilities of the organization managing the set, and on the capabilities of the applications that are traditionally used to process and analyze the data set in its domain. For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.\n\n\nA PDF collection of 9 eBooks about Big Data. eBooks are sorted on publisher's name.\n\nMC Press Big Data Analytics, Disruptive Technologies for Changing the Game (2012).pdf\nOReilly Big Data Glossary (2011).pdf\nOReilly Big Data Now (2011).pdf\nOReilly Big Data Now, 2012 Edition (2012).pdf\nOReilly Ethics of Big Data (2012).pdf\nOReilly Privacy and Big Data (2011).pdf\nPackt Publishing Implementing Splunk, Big Data Reporting and Development for Operational Intelligence (2013).pdf\nWiley Big Data for Dummies (2013).pdf\nWiley Taming the Big Data Tidal Wave, Finding Opportunities in Huge Data Streams with Advanced Analytics (2012).pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e1b12b815ae0d41240f73e98405cd415b8a5c17","amp;dn":"Big+Data+eBooks+Mini-Pack+%5BPDF%5D-OMNiSCiENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e1b12b815ae0d41240f73e98405cd415b8a5c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,27,18,184,21,174,13,65,36,15,115,233,132,5,205,65,91,138,92,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
