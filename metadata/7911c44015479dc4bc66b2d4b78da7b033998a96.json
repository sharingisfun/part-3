This series was developed to bring back the \nfoundation of science to network television at the height of other scientific-based \ntelevision series and films. The show is presented by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, \nwho was inspired by Sagan as a young college student. Among the executive producers are \nSeth MacFarlane, whose clout and financial investment was instrumental in bringing the show \nto broadcast television, and Ann Druyan, Sagan's widow and a co-creator of the original \nseries. The series loosely follows the same thirteen-episode format and storytelling approach \nthat the original Cosmos used, including elements such as the &quot;Ship of the Imagination&quot;, \nbut features information updated since the 1980 series along with extensive computer-generated \ngraphics and animation footage augmenting the narration. The show is produced by Brannon \nBraga, and Alan Silvestri provides the backing score. (Wikiperdia, 2014)\n\nThe series premiered on March 9, 2014, simultaneously in the US across ten 21st Century \nFox networks. The remainder of the series will air on Fox, with the National Geographic \nChannel rebroadcasting the episodes the next night with extra content. The series has \nbeen rebroadcast internationally in dozens of other countries by local National Geographic \nand Fox stations.\n\nEpisode list:\n1.&quot;Standing Up in the Milky Way&quot;\n2.&quot;Some of the Things That Molecules Do&quot;\n3.&quot;When Knowledge Conquered Fear&quot;\n4.&quot;A Sky Full of Ghosts&quot;\n5.&quot;Hiding in the Light&quot;\n6.&quot;Deeper, Deeper, Deeper Still&quot;\n7.&quot;The Clean Room&quot;\n8.&quot;Sisters of the Sun&quot;\n9.&quot;The Lost Worlds of Planet Earth&quot;\n10.&quot;The Electric Boy&quot;\n11.&quot;The Immortals&quot;\n12.&quot;The World Set Free&quot;\n13.&quot;Unafraid of the Dark&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7911c44015479dc4bc66b2d4b78da7b033998a96","amp;dn":"Cosmos+A+Spacetime+Odyssey+-+The+Complete+First+Season","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7911c44015479dc4bc66b2d4b78da7b033998a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,17,196,64,21,71,157,196,188,102,178,212,183,141,167,176,51,153,138,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
