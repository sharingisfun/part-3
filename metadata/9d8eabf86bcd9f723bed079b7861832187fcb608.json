Applying this knowledge to current environmental issues leads to the remediation of environmental media, and to new, low energy, low emission, sustainable processes. The topics that would be covered in this series, but not limited to, are major achievements of environmental chemistry for sustainable development such as nanotech applications; biofuels, solar and alternative energies; pollutants in air, water, soil and food; greenhouse gases; radioactive pollutants; endocrine disruptors and other pharmaceuticals; pollutant archives; ecotoxicology and health risk; pollutant remediation; geoengineering; green chemistry; contributions bridging unexpectedly far disciplines such as environmental chemistry and social sciences; and participatory research with end-users.\r\n\r\nThe books series will encompass all scientific aspects of environmental chemistry through a multidisciplinary approach: Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology, Waste Management/Waste Technology, Pollution, general, Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution, Analytical Chemistry.\r\n\r\nOther disciplines include: Agriculture, Building Types and Functions, Climate Change, Ecosystems, Ecotoxicology, Geochemistry, Nanochemistry, Nanotechnology and Microengineering, Social Sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d8eabf86bcd9f723bed079b7861832187fcb608","amp;dn":"Environmental+Chemistry+for+a+Sustainable+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d8eabf86bcd9f723bed079b7861832187fcb608","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,142,171,248,107,205,159,114,59,237,7,155,120,97,131,33,135,252,182,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
