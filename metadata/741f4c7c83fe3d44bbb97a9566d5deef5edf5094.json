It would have been their first tour of America in more than 5 years. However, the recent bankruptcy of SPV forced both Pain of Salvation and Beardfish to back out of the tour because of a lack of financial backing.\n\nIn a recent interview with Inside the Pain, Daniel GildenlÃƒÂ¶w stated that the new album was planned for release sometime in mid August, during their now cancelled Progressive Nation tour appearance, however this release date was not likely. On November 1, 2008, the band debuted a new song, &quot;Mortar Grind&quot;, from their upcoming studio album and EP. According to the same interview with Inside the Pain, it was revealed that the new album would feature 2 CDs, 22 songs in a concept similar in style to that of Remedy Lane. The music written is 'different to anything the band has ever done before' featuring experimental and psychedelic style performances.\n\nIn a recent update on the band's official website, it was stated that the final steps in the completion of the new album were put on hold because of the bankruptcy of SPV. Recently however it was announced that InsideOut Music was picked up by Century Media, allowing progress on the album to continue.\n\nOn October 5, 2009, Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater announced that Pain of Salvation would be their supporting act for a tour of Australia. \n\nIn December 2009, it was confirmed that the title track of the new double album, &quot;Road Salt,&quot; would be an entry in the 2010 edition of Melodifestivalen, Sweden's national final for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest. The band performed during the first semi-final and qualified for the runners-up broadcast, on march 6th on Swedish national television. However, they did not progress to the finals, losing to Pernilla Wahlgren by a slim margin.\n\nOn February 19, 2010, Daniel GildenlÃƒÂ¶w revealed on his Facebook page that the name of the first part of the Road Salt albums to be released later that year would be &quot;Road Salt 1: Ivory&quot;. He also posted a brief lyrical excerpt from a song on the album called &quot;Curiosity&quot;. The actual release dates were set for May 17 in most of Europe and June 8 in the U.S. The release includes both a standard edition and limited edition with a bonus track and extended versions of 'No Way' and 'Road Salt'. On May 9, Road Salt One leaked on the internet.\n\nPain of Salvation made their first tour of India in January with performances at Manfest organised by Indian Institute of Management(IIM), Lucknow on the 22nd of January and at Saarang, organised by Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Madras on the 29th of January.[16]\n\nOn March 9, 2011, Daniel GildenlÃƒÂ¶w announced on his Facebook page, that 'Road Salt Two' would be mixed and mastered in mid-May 2011, and released in September 2011.

He also revealed the titles of several songs set to appear on the album: new, remixed versions of &quot;Mortar Grind&quot;, &quot;Conditioned&quot;, &quot;Healing Now&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;To The Shoreline&quot;, &quot;Through The Distance&quot;, &quot;Softly She Cries&quot;, &quot;In The Physics of Grindlock&quot; and &quot;The Deeper Cut&quot;.
