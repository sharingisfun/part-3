Habib's lucidity and wit will also make his book highly teachable.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nMichael Payne, Bucknell University\n\n&quot;This huge undertaking offers a comprehensive, expository and lucid account - including close readings of selected formative texts - of the history of literary criticism and theory from the earliest western classics to influential contemporary movements, while also embedding these in their broader social, cultural and philosophical contexts. A major resource - as narrative or as compendium - for students at all levels.&quot;\nPeter Widdowson, University of Gloucestershire\n\n&quot;Beginning with Plato and Aristotle, Habib traces how the study of literature evolved in the West. His strength lies in his short segments, which allow readers to absorb the major thoughts of the critics and movements without being overwhelmed. While the book runs nearly 900 pages, it is easy to maneuver. All told, Habib delivers an accessible yet scholarly survey of literary criticism.&quot;\nRon Ratliff, Kansas State University\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 848 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (October 8, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1405176083\nISBN-13: 978-1405176088\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c18eccaaa4ae22d8fb20a83772cbea770edb2222","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Literary+Criticism+and+Theory%3A+From+Plato+to+the+Pr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c18eccaaa4ae22d8fb20a83772cbea770edb2222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,142,204,170,164,174,34,216,251,32,168,55,114,203,234,119,14,219,34,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
