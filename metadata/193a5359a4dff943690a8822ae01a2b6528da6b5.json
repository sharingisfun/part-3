Reverb gives a natural richness to your recordings, which is possible to reproduce. Producer and audio engineer Alex U. Case covers the acoustic, mechanical, and digital means for creating reverb, and charts the parameters (room size, density, etc.) you'll need to know to take advantage of the original recording space and enhance it in post. He then shows how to simulate reverb digitally with effects, adding timbre, texture, and contrast, and improve the sound of your mixes with a sense of space and depth.\nThese techniques can be practiced with the free Get in the Mix sessions, currently available for Pro Tools and Logic Pro.\n\nTopics include:\n\n- What is reverb?\n- Understanding how acoustic reverb works in rooms\n- Working with the signal flow, effects loops, and available CPU resources\n- Understanding core parameters, like reverb time and pre-delay\n- Simulating space\n- Creating nonlinear reverb\n- Building pre-delay effects\n- Using reverse reverb\n- Using convolution correctly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:193a5359a4dff943690a8822ae01a2b6528da6b5","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Foundations+of+Audio%3A+Reverb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"193a5359a4dff943690a8822ae01a2b6528da6b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,58,83,89,164,223,249,67,105,10,136,34,174,1,162,182,82,141,166,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
