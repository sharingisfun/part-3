Using straightforward mathematics and physics, the book covers in depth the anatomical foundation of biomechanics, the biomechanical and physiological foundation of human motion, and the fundamentals of biomechanics.\r\n\r\nDivided into four parts, the book covers:\r\n\r\n*The musculoskeletal anatomy of the major muscles, their functions, and the different roles of the muscles in human mechanics\r\n\r\n*The biomechanical and physiological foundations of human motion, including the very basic conceptions about lever systems, center of gravity, kinematic chain systems, and Newtonâ€™s laws\r\n\r\n*Kinematics and kinetics via complex examples from martial arts and their comparison to different sports techniques\r\n\r\n*The biomechanical principles and analysis of the martial arts, including anatomical and physiological considerations, and the analysis of the physical properties of a range of techniques\r\n\r\nFocusing on martial arts and sports activities, this book is designed to be used by undergraduate and graduate students of human movement science, physical education, and fitness, as well as college instructors and martial artists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46c07be8edd6013a5af992e88f292f2df7c425b2","amp;dn":"Biomechanics+of+Human+Motion+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46c07be8edd6013a5af992e88f292f2df7c425b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,192,123,232,237,214,1,58,90,249,146,232,143,41,47,45,247,196,37,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
