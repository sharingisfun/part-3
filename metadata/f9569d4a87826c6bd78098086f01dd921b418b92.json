SQL Essential Training is designed to help users understand the most common language for database wranglingÃ¢â‚¬â€SQL. Beginning with a brief introduction, instructor Bill Weinman teaches the major features of SQL; he offers a solid working knowledge of the language, and how to retrieve and manage data efficiently. He also works through a real-world example of building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application using SQL. Exercise files accompany the course.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9569d4a87826c6bd78098086f01dd921b418b92","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+SQL+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9569d4a87826c6bd78098086f01dd921b418b92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,86,157,74,135,130,108,107,215,128,152,8,111,1,221,146,27,65,139,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
