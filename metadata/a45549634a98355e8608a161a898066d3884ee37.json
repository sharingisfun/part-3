The band \nis the musical outlet for singer/songwriter Glenn Danzig, preceded by the horror \npunk bands the Misfits and Samhain. They play in a bluesy doom-driven heavy metal \nstyle influenced by the early sound of Black Sabbath.\n\nBeginnings (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1987)\nOn July 14, 1986, Samhain performed at The Ritz in New York in what was to be their \nfinal show. In attendance was Rick Rubin, who was scouting for potential bands to \nsign to his record label, Def American. Rubin at first wished only to sign Danzig, \nwith the intent of making him the vocalist for a hard rock supergroup that Rubin \nenvisioned. However, Danzig refused to sign to Rubin's label without Samhain's \nbassist Eerie Von. In 1987, he added John Christ on guitar and Chuck Biscuits \n(ex-Black Flag) on drums. To reflect the change in musical direction and avoid \nhaving to start anew after future lineup changes, Glenn, on Rubin's advice, changed \nthe name of Samhain to his surname, Danzig.\n\n&quot;Classic&quot; original lineup-era (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1994)\nIn 1988, the band released its first album on Def American (later renamed to \nAmerican Recordings).\nIn 1990, Danzig released its second album, Danzig II: Lucifuge. By 1992, Rubin's \ninvolvement with the band had waned. Danzig himself took credit for co-producing \nthe third album, Danzig III: How the Gods Kill. The following year the band released \nthe Thrall: Demonsweatlive EP, which contained several live tracks from the band's \n1992 Halloween show as well as three new studio tracks. The live version of &quot;Mother\n,&quot; a song from the first album, became popular on hard rock radio stations. A new \nversion of the &quot;Mother&quot; music video was created using live footage, and the video \nbecame a hit on MTV as well.\nOn October 4, 1994, Danzig 4 was released. The album sold well, but did not contain \na hit on par with the &quot;Mother&quot; single. The album's second single, &quot;Cantspeak&quot;, was \nalso a staple in MTV's rotation, but unlike &quot;Mother&quot; failed to appear on the \nBillboard Hot 100. &quot;Cantspeak&quot; is the band's only single other than &quot;Mother&quot; to \nchart on Billboard. Amid accusations of unpaid royalties and broken promises, \nDanzig's relationship with Rubin deteriorated, and the band left the record label.\nAround this time, the band's lineup began to dissolve as well. First, Chuck \nBiscuits left the band in the summer of 1994 due to royalty disagreements. According \nto a special issue of Kerrang!, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl turned down an \napproach by the band. Biscuits was replaced by Joey Castillo, who made his first \npublic appearance as a member of Danzig at an in-store signing the day of the \nfourth album's release. Coincidentally, Castillo would later replace Grohl in Queens \nof the Stone Age. Though the band had toured successfully with its new drummer during \nthe fall and winter of 1994-95, by the spring of 1995 Danzig was actively seeking a \nnew guitarist, with Pepper Keenan and Dez Cadena considered possible replacements. \nJohn Christ and Eerie Von resigned on July 5, 1995.\n\nPost-original lineup-era (1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1999)\n\nIn October 1996, Danzig 5: Blackacidevil was released. The album was mostly a solo \neffort by Danzig, although Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains played lead guitar \non three of the album's tracks. Joey Castillo played drums, the sole member still \nin the band from the 4p Tour. Castillo would record on two more Danzig albums, \nmaking him the longest-standing member outside of the original lineup.\nFor the next few years, Danzig was tied up in a legal battle with Rubin over the \nrights to unreleased material the band recorded for American Recordings. In November \n1999, Danzig 6:66 Satan's Child was released. A long-planned Samhain box set was also \nreleased, followed by a Samhain reunion tour. Samhain opened for Danzig for six weeks \nduring the tour and consisted of Steve Zing and London May switching between bass \nand drums.\n\nLater years (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2005)\n\nBy 2000, Danzig's line up had stabilized with the addition of guitarist Todd Youth \nand bassist Howie Pyro, both veterans of the New York City punk scene. In 2002, \nthis line up released the album Danzig 777: I Luciferi. In 2004, Danzig released \ntheir eighth studio album, Circle of Snakes, with the line up featuring Tommy Victor \nof Prong on guitar, who had toured as a member of Danzig years earlier.\nSoon after the album's release, Danzig undertook the Blackest of the Black tour \nacross the United States, replacing Circle of Snakes drummer Bevan Davies with \nJohnny Kelly (of Type O Negative).\n\nRecent activity (2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nThroughout 2006, Glenn Danzig stated in several interviews that he had grown tired \nof the touring cycle, and did not expect to partake in any more large scale tours. \nInstead, Danzig would go on small, localized tours, such as the ten west coast dates \nthey played for the 2006 Blackest of the Black tour. This tour debuted Kenny Hickey \n(of Type O Negative) as the band's new guitarist, while the East Coast dates saw \nthe addition of former Samhain member, Steve Zing on bass.\nIn October 2006, Glenn Danzig released Black Aria II, the follow-up to his solo \nclassical album, Black Aria. Black Aria was re-released by Evilive in May 2007. \nHe spent the rest of the year completing the production and packaging of The Lost \nTracks of Danzig, a double CD containing twenty-six unreleased songs that span the \nentire Danzig catalog, which was released on July 10, 2007. Danzig has also stated \nthat he plans to record a dark blues album with either Jerry Cantrell or Hank Williams\n III.\n\nIn August 2008, Glenn Danzig announced that Danzig (the band) would do a 20th \nanniversary tour, celebrating the release of their self-titled debut album. This was \nthe band's first full US tour in three years, which also included stops in Canada \nand Mexico. Also asked in August 2008 if the ninth Danzig album was planned, Glenn \nDanzig replied:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ I have been in the studio here and there working on new songs but don't know when \nthey will come out. I was thinking of putting one up on the Danzig site so the \nfans could check it out. Even thought about doing one on this tour. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Glenn Danzig, August 2008\n \nOn December 26, 2009, Danzig performed at the Starland Ballroom in New Jersey. The \nshow was notable for featuring a special appearance by Michale Graves who, along with \nDoyle and Dr. Chud, performed several songs by the reformed version of the Misfits.\nOn March 10, 2010, a Danzig lyric book was released, titled Hidden Lyrics of the \nLeft Hand. The book contains unreleased song lyrics combined with illustrations by \nSimon Bisley.\nDanzig released Deth Red Sabaoth, their ninth studio album, on June 22, 2010. It is \nthe band's first proper studio album in six years, since 2004's Circle of Snakes. \nBoth Tommy Victor and Johnny Kelly appeared on the record.\nIn 2009, movie director Todd Phillips chose Danzig's song &quot;Thirteen&quot; to open his \nfilm The Hangover. Danzig later recorded a new song, &quot;Black Hell&quot;, to appear in \nthe 2011 sequel, The Hangover: Part II.\nIn January 2011, Danzig were announced for the 2011 Download Festival at Donington \nPark, England, alongside bands including Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper, and System of a \nDown. On the first day of the festival, Danzig headlined the Pepsi Max stage. On \nJune 12, 2011, Danzig played at the Nova Rock Festival.\nOn October 25, 2011, a greatest hits album entitled The Essential Danzig was to be \nreleased through Sony BMG. However, as of December 2011, this has yet to happen, \nnor have details of the release been given.\nOctober 2011 also saw a rare string of reunion shows called the &quot;Danzig Legacy&quot; tour. \nThe shows consisted of a Danzig mini set, followed by a Samhain mini set, a set of \nDanzig and Doyle performing Misfits songs, and then ending with three Danzig songs \nand the performance of &quot;Skulls&quot;.\nIn May 2012, Danzig released the song &quot;Devil's Angels&quot;, the theme from the 1967 film \nof the same name, from his as yet untitled covers album: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I've wanted to record this \nsong since 1979 and this is exactly the same arrangement I had for it back then, so \nit pretty much sounds like that late 70s style of mine. I'm really happy with the \nway it turned out, it actually came out much better than I had hoped it would. We're \ngoing to be playing it live on these upcoming shows.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nIn April 2013, Glenn Danzig told Full Metal Jackie that he will begin work on new \nDanzig material with Tommy Victor and Johnny Kelly after the 25th anniversary \ntour\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a45549634a98355e8608a161a898066d3884ee37","amp;dn":"Danzig+discography+%5BAPE%2BCUE%5D+1988-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a45549634a98355e8608a161a898066d3884ee37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,85,73,99,74,152,53,94,134,8,161,97,168,152,6,109,56,132,238,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
