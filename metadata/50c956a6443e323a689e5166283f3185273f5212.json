The race goes over 24 hours on 14.5 kilometers of cordoned country road. Every few hours the two drivers per car alternate - but it&amp;#x27;s still a challenge for concentration and material. In the focus is the duel between the German Stahler in Ferrari 512LM and the American Delaney in Gulf Team Porsche 917. Delaney is under extraordinary pressure, because the year before he caused a severe accident, in which his friend Lisa&amp;#x27;s husband was killed.\nRating: 6.4\nCast: Steve McQueen, Siegfried Rauch, Elga Andersen, Ronald Leigh-Hunt, Fred Haltiner, Luc Merenda, Christopher Waite, Louise Edlind, Angelo Infanti, Jean-Claude Bercq, Michele Scalera, Gino Cassani, Alfred Bell, Carlo Cecchi, Richard RÃƒÂ¼diger\nWriter(s): Harry Kleiner\n\n\n\nGenre......: Action | Adventure | Sport\nLanguage...: English\nLenth......: 1h 48min\nResolution.: 1280x544\nBitrate....: 4244 Kb/s\nAudio......: 1509 DTS\nSubs.......: EN SE NO DK FI\n\niMDB - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067334/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50c956a6443e323a689e5166283f3185273f5212","amp;dn":"+Le.Mans.1971.720p.BluRay.x264-SAiMORNY+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50c956a6443e323a689e5166283f3185273f5212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,201,86,166,68,62,50,58,104,158,81,102,40,63,49,133,39,63,82,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
