Yeah, you've got that topic nailed. Having virtualized servers atop VMware vSphere, you think you're ready to branch out into desktop virtualization? Think again.\n\nVirtualizing desktops requires skills far beyond simple server virtualization. You've got storage contention to monitor, user state data to manage, login storms to prepare for, and a host of other problems unique to desktop VMs. Not to mention, you've also got a new product to learn: VMware View 5.\n\nCBT Nuggets instructor Greg Shields has been with us a long time, and in that time he's been globally recognized for his experience and expertise in virtualization of all forms. Having been awarded Microsoft's MVP, VMware's vExpert, and Citrix's CTP, there's no better instructor in the world to help evolve your server virtualization knowledge into desktop VDI. In this, his fifteenth training series for CBT Nuggets, Greg explores the topics and technologies surrounding VMware's VDI platform, View 5. You'll learn which buttons to click, but more importantly, you'll learn why you should click them Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and in a few cases, why you absolutely shouldn't.\n\nAt the same time, you'll get a leg up on studying for that all-important VMware VCAP-DT certification, focusing specifically on the VCP510-DT exam.\n\nDesktop virtualization is a huge effort in time and energies. Make sure yours are perfectly aligned for success. Join Greg in this short/sweet/to-the-point CBT Nuggets series that'll ensure your VDI implementation passes the test.\n\nCBT Nuggets Trainer: Greg Shields\n\nVideos:\n\nIntroduction to VMware View, the VCAP-DT, and the VCP510-DT Exam\nUnderstanding VMware View's Architecture and Components\nPreparing for and Installing the View Connection Server\nBuilding and Provisioning your First Virtual Desktop\nConfiguring Pool Settings and Connecting to Virtual Desktops\nManaging Automated Pools with Full VMs\nInstalling View Composer and Managing Linked-Clone VMs\nUnderstanding and Configuring RDP and PCoIP\nInstalling View Transfer Server and Managing for Local Mode\nCreating and Working with a View Events Database\nFitting Desktop Virtualization into your Application Delivery Infrastructure\nCreating ThinApp Virtual Applications\nIntegrating VMware ThinApp into VMware View\nManaging User Settings with View Persona Management\nConfiguring Printing for View Desktops\nManaging for Kiosk Mode\nInstalling and Configuring View Security Server for External Clients\nIntegrating Certificates and Smart Cards into VMware View\nConfiguring View Roles and Permissions\nTroubleshooting a VMware View Environment\n\nTotal Series Duration: 7 hours","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d83167fd8567d57539ead24bc03f5fac229eb07b","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+VMware+View+5+and+Preparing+for+the+VCP510-DT+Exam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d83167fd8567d57539ead24bc03f5fac229eb07b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,49,103,253,133,103,213,117,57,234,210,75,192,63,95,172,34,158,176,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
