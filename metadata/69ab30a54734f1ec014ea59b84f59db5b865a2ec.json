It is a regionalized spin-off of the highly-popular series Storage Wars. The show features auctioneer Walt Cade, as well as auction hunters Ricky and Bubba Smith, Morris &quot;Moe&quot; Prigoff, Victor Rjesnjansky, Lesa Lewis and her assistant Jerry Simpson, and Roy Williams, with new bidders Jenny Grumbles and Mary Padian starting in the second season. The premise is essentially the same as the parent show: when rent is not paid on a storage locker for three months in Texas, the contents are sold by an auctioneer as a single lot of items. The show follows professional buyers who bid on the contents (usually for the purpose of reselling for profit should they purchase a locker) based only on a five-minute inspection and what they can see only from the door when it is opened.\n\nSixteen episodes were filmed for the first season, debuting on A&amp;E on Tuesday December 6, 2011. The premiere episode garnered 4.1 million viewers, making it the most watched series launch in network history.\n\n\nEpisode List\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Storage_Wars:_Texas_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Storage_Wars:_Texas_episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSeason 1 (2011-2012)\n- Episode 01 to 16\n\nSeason 2 (2012-2013)\n- Episode 01 to 34","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69ab30a54734f1ec014ea59b84f59db5b865a2ec","amp;dn":"Storage+Wars+Texas+-+Season+1+to+2+-+Complete+%28NO+SUBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69ab30a54734f1ec014ea59b84f59db5b865a2ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,171,48,165,71,52,241,236,1,78,165,155,132,245,157,181,184,101,162,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
