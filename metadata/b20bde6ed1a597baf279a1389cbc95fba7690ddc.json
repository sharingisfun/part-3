Mordhaus is now a floating fortress and is undergoing heavy renovations to repair the damage from the Revengencers attack, but due to the band\\'s inability to manage their finances they find themselves in a financial crisis. The band plans the most expensive concert in history to herald their return, but run afoul of their record label\\'s president\\'s son, who wishes to get revenge for an incident at the beginning of Dethklok\\'s career, in which Nathan Explosion punched him for making fun of death metal. The concert begins as planned, but the CEO\\'s son literally pulls the plug on Dethklok and refuses to let them continue until they renegotiate their contract on terms much more favorable to the label. Just as Nathan prepares to sign the new contract, Charles Offdensen appears, apparently back from the dead, and tells Dethklok that they should continue with the show and that he will take care of the contract. After the band finishes their concert, Offdensen explains that he had himself pronounced dead at the scene (at the end of Season 2), and that there was something he had to do, and that he will tell Dethklok about it when the time is right.\n\nGuest voices: Scott Ian, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai\nSongs included: \\&quot;Bloodmoney\\&quot; \n40 \t\\&quot;TributeKlok\\&quot; \tNovember 15, 2009 (2009-11-15) \t302\n\nFacing public scrutiny following brash statements made by Murderface at a press conference, Dethklok decides to lift their worldwide ban on Dethklok tribute bands. While exercising their right to approve or disapprove of any tribute act the band discovers that Toki has been posing as Skwisgaar in a tribute band called Thunderhorse. Trying to distance themselves from celebrity status and re-connect with normal people, Dethklok decides to join Thunderhorse.\n\nGuest voices: Slash, Scott Ian, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai\nSongs included: \\&quot;Organic Destruction,\\&quot; \\&quot;Face Fisted,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Thunderhorse\\&quot; \n41 \t\\&quot;DethHealth\\&quot; \tNovember 22, 2009 (2009-11-22) \t303\n\nAfter a near-death experience, Dethklok must face the brutality of going to a doctor. They attempt to get good checkup results by cleansing their bodies by drinking bleach, giving Nathan horrible nightmares about his teeth. Nathan visits a dentist while the rest of Dethklok goes to the doctor. During the visit, Murderface accidentally ejaculates on a doctor\\'s face. Afterwards, the checkup results show that Pickles has a terminal illness. Murderface then confronts the doctor about his experience, and finds that the doctor is flirting with him, establishing that the doctor is gay and thus nullifying any possibility that Murderface is gay. Nathan finally gets his teeth worked on by a suicidal dentist. More lab results come back and reveal that Pickles is not dying as he switched his urine sample with Murderface who switched his pee with Skwisgaar who switched his pee with Nathan who switched his pee with Toki who switched his pee with his cat, which is actually dead. The band entombs the cat in a gigantic feline statue and places it next to the Great Pyramids of Egypt. The sand gives way under the enormous metal figure and it falls over on top of the pyramids, crushing them. Finally, Nathan befriends his dentist and goes on a hunting trip with him. Then the dentist says, \\&quot;Check this out,\\&quot; before placing his shotgun in his own mouth and blowing his head off.\n\nGuest voices: Ace Frehley\nSongs included: \\&quot;A Bloody Mess\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hamburger Time\\&quot; \n42 \t\\&quot;Dethmas\\&quot; \tDecember 6, 2009 (2009-12-06) \t304\n\nWhile Murderface works with Dick Knubbler on a Christmas special, the Dethklok Moms appear at Mordhaus to spend the holidays.

Several thousand men came forward, claiming to be Skwisgaar\\'s father as they had sex with his mother, but DNA testing finds no match. Meanwhile, much to Pickle\\'s jealousy, Murderface steps up to be a father figure to Skwigaar. He then receives a message from his mother, Surfetta, saying she found his father. Skwisgaar quits the band and moves back to Sweden. There, he discovers that Surfetta was referring to his new stepfather, as opposed to his biological father. He becomes annoyed at their constant making out, and eventually snaps. He shoves his stepfather onto a glass table, shattering it. Back at Mordhaus, the band seems to crumble without having Skwisgaar there. They decide to go to Sweden and get Skwisgaar back. In Sweden, Skwisgaar apologizes to his stepfather, and begins working in a lumberyard with him. Later on that night, Skwisgaar is at the pub when the other members of the band walk in. He says he is not coming back, and that he is finally happy. Before they leave, Nathan tells him that he is a god and he won\\'t be able to live with regular people. When going home that night with his stepfather, they walk in the house to find Surfetta having sex with two men. Skwisgaar\\'s stepfather runs away, and when Skwisgaar feels that he is without a dad again, he runs into the forest. He realizes that what Nathan said is true, that he isn\\'t a regular person, but he is a guitar god. He runs back to the band, saying he\\'s coming with them. Murderface begins acting like a father again, and told Pickles \\&quot;Get out, you belong in a garbage can,\\&quot; much like Pickle\\'s real father told him many years ago.

The episode ends with Skwisgaar returning to the band.\n\nGuest voice: Matt Pike of High on Fire\nSongs included: \\&quot;I\\'m No Man (I\\'m\\'s a God)\\&quot; \n44 \t\\&quot;Fertilityklok\\&quot; \tSeptember 26, 2010 (2010-09-26) [4] \t306\n\nAfter playing in Tokyo, Dethklok kidnaps Toki for his birthday party. The band supplies him with many women to have sex with, but Toki declines and instead begins the search for a soul mate. Using a dating service his search goes horribly wrong, and in the end he has sex with all the woman the rest of the band gave him on his birthday.

On the show, they judge a nu metal band known as Get Thee Hence and like the group so much that they decide to start their own record label called MurderTooth Records and sign Get Thee Hence as their first and only band. While Toki and Murderface learn the horrors of managing a band, Pickles, Nathan, and Skwisgaar are unhappy with their new 47 songs because it lacks negativity.

While in rehab, the band replaces Pickles at practice with a high tech, sentient drum machine named X2P1158 which is inexplicably armed with a 10,000 megaton self detonation device. At the rehab center, Malevolent Creation, Pickles is rehabilitated through steps 1 through 11 leaving only step 12 which requires him to forgive his brother whom he hates because he blames his brother for his drinking.

Pickles forgives his brother while at dinner at Outback Steakhouse, who immediately extorts 5 million dollars from him. When the band informs X2P1158 who they have recently come to dislike, the drum machine go haywire and kidnaps the band, locking them in a van and starts its self detonation sequence while attached to the vehicle.
