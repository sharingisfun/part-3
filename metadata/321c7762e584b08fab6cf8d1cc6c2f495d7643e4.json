Dream Theater heralds an exceptionally energized and profoundly dynamic emergent chapter for the melodic, progressive and consistently heavy masters of hard rock invention. Dream Theater is a name synonymous with the penultimate synthesis of studied expertise and relentless creative passion. It is an album that at once recalls the brilliant hallmarks that have made the band icons to fellow musicians and hard rock fans alike, while simultaneously a bold declaration of a future yet to come.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:321c7762e584b08fab6cf8d1cc6c2f495d7643e4","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+Dream+Theater+%5Bmp3-vbr-2013%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"321c7762e584b08fab6cf8d1cc6c2f495d7643e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,28,119,98,229,132,176,143,171,108,248,209,204,108,47,73,93,118,67,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
