Few albums in the rock genre have these statistics.  One must look at this album realistically, however, it being recorded during the practical breakup of the group, with tensions higher than ever between John Lennon, Paul McCartney and producer George Martin. Basically McCartney's album, his own songwriting efforts consume most of the tracks, Lennon's own somehow being pushed into a small corner on the first side. His own songs, in my opinion, reveal some of the most passionate, intense and brilliantly written songs on the album. George Harrison's compositions &amp;quot;Something&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Here Comes the Sun&amp;quot; are some of his best ever released and are also highlights on the record. McCartney's tracks, which may be at times outrageously overproduced, show an extremely mature style of songwriting that would affect his career for many years to come. With the exception of Paul's &amp;quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&amp;quot;, Ringo's &amp;quot;Octopus's Garden&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Golden Slumbers&amp;quot;/Carry That Weight&amp;quot; medely, all songs are some of the greatest rock numbers ever. For the old Beatles fan, you should own this already, but for the uninitiated, this is a great place to start.\n\nThe Beatles\nAbbey Road (1969)\nCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers.\nApprox 110.4Mb\n\n01 Come Together        \n02 Something        \n03 Maxwell's Silver Hammer        \n04 Oh!
