All the Greatest Hits songs Principally recorded at United Sound Systems and Sound Room East, Detroit, Michigan. This 17-track compilation contains three certifiable R&amp;B classics: the funk anthem &quot;More Bounce To The Ounce,&quot; the trendsetting &quot;Computer Love,&quot; and one of the finest singles of the '80s, Roger Troutman's solo smash &quot;I Want To Be Your Man.&quot; The last is an achingly soulful and slow groove accented with the best use of the Vocoder (a device that changes the pitch of a voice without altering its tempo) in pop music history. All the Greatest Hits CD music contains a single disc with 17 songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83926af5b3aa694cb46ed3aefc74d4817d14ac9a","amp;dn":"Zapp+And+Roger+-+All+The+Greatest+Hits+%281993%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83926af5b3aa694cb46ed3aefc74d4817d14ac9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,146,106,245,179,170,105,76,180,110,211,174,252,116,212,129,125,20,172,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
