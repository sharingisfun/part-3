Then from a very high state of consciousness we fell in darkness and forgot who we were. For thousands of years the secret was held in ancient artifacts and carvings around the world, and encoded in the cells of all life.\nHere Drunvalo Melchizedek presents in text and graphics the first half of the Flower of Life Workshop, illuninating the mysteries of how we came to be, why the world is the way it is and the subtle energies that allow our awareness to blossom into its true beauty.\nSacred Geometry is the form beneath our being and points to a divine order in our reality. We can follow that order form the invisible atom to the infinite stars, finding ourselves at each step. The information here is one path, but between the lines and drawings lie the feminine gems of intuitive understanding.\nExplore the miracle of our existence by meandering through the wonderland of geometry, science, ancient history and new discovery, seen through the widened vision of Drunvalo and the Flower of Life. Volume 2 will explore in great detail the Mer-Ka-Ba, the 55-foot-diameter energy field of the human lightbody. This knowledge leads to ascension and the next dimensional world.\n\nAncient Secret of the Flower of Life Vol II\n\nThe sacred Flower of Life pattern, the primary geometric generator of all physical form, is explored in even more depth in this volume, the second half of the Flower of Life workshop. The proportions of the human body, the nuances of human consciousness, the sizes and distances of the stars, planets and moons, even the creations of humankind, are all shown to reflect their origins in this beautiful and divine image. Through an intricate and detailed geometrical mapping, Drunvalo Melchizedek shows how the seemingly simple design of the Flower of Life contains the genesis of our entire third-dimensional existence.\nFrom the pyramids and mysteries of Egypt to the new race of Indigo children, Drunvalo presents the sacred geometries of the Reality and the subtle energies that shape our world. We are led through a divinely inspired labyrinth of science and stories, logic and coincidence, on a path of remembering where we come from and the wonder and magic of who we are.\nFinally, for the first time in print, Drunvalo shares the instructions for the Mer-Ka-Ba meditation, step-by-step techniques for the re-creation of the energy field of the evolved human, which is the key to ascension and the next dimensional world. If done from love, this ancient process of breathing prana opens up for us a world of tantalizing possibility in this dimension, from protective powers to the healing of oneself, of others and even of the planet.\nEmbrace the examined vision and understanding that Drunvalo offers to the world. Coincidences abound, miracles flourish and amazing stories of mysteries unveiled arise as the author probes the Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life.\n\n\nLiving in the Heart\n\nAll over the planet Drunvalo Melchizedek is known and immensely loved as a great spiritual teacher. Through workshops and books he brought his vision of the Flower of Life and the Mer-Ka-Ba to the world. Now, based on his latest series of workshops, he shares his experiences of living in the sacred space within the heart, and he explains the processes and techniques he uses to enter this space. Join him and be part of the large group of people who have found the joy of living in the space where you and God are one.\n&quot;Long ago we humans used a form of communication and sensing that did not involve the brain in any way; rather, it came from a sacred place within our heart.\nWhat good would it do to find this place again in a world where the greatest religion is science and the logic of the mind? DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t I know this world where emotions and feelings are second-class citizens? Yes, I do.\nBut my teachers have asked me to remind you who you really are. You are more than a human being, much more. For within your heart is a place, a sacred place where the world can literally be remade through conscious cocreation. If you give me permission, I will show what has been shown to me.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drunvalo Melchizedek\n\nSerpent of Light\n\nEvery 13,000 years on Earth a sacred and secret event takes place that changes everything. Mother Earth's Kundalini energy emerges from its resting place in the planet's core and moves like a snake across the surface of our world. Once at home in ancient Lemuria, it moved to Atlantis, then to the Himalayan mountains of India and Tibet, and with every relocation changed our idea of what spiritual means. And gender. And heart. This time, with much difficulty, the Serpent of Light has moved to the Andes Mountains of Chile and Peru.\nMulti-dimensional, multi-disciplined, and multi-lived, for the first time in this book, Drunvalo begins to tell his stories of 35 years spent in service to Mother Earth. Follow him around the world as he follows the guidance of Ascended Masters, his two spheres of light, and his own inner growing knowledge. His story is a living string of ceremonies to help heal hearts, align energies, right ancient imbalances, and balance the living Earth's Unity Consciousness Grid-- in short to increase our awareness of the indivisibility of life in the universe. We are all--rocks and people and interdimensional beings--one!\n&quot;Life may seem to be business as usual, but it is not. We are changing fast . . . Remember this for life is going to present stranger things to you in your lifetime, and they all have meaning and purpose . . .Only Mother Earth and ancient Maya know what's going to happen.&quot; --fromÃ‚Â Serpent of Light\n* Part travel adventure, part spiritual instruction--a firsthand account of a once in 13,000 years process. * Drunvalo Melchizedek has a story to tell--an adventure story, a story of healing ceremonies that take place from the Yucatan to Kauai and Moorea to the Grand Canyon and New Zealand and to Peru. * See what can happen when we choose to open our hearts and follow the path of light.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d9789575c64c0ccaeafeacc1bbebd329ebe160","amp;dn":"Drunvalo+Melchizedek+Complete+E-Book+PDF+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d9789575c64c0ccaeafeacc1bbebd329ebe160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,217,120,149,117,198,76,12,202,234,254,172,193,187,235,211,41,235,225,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
