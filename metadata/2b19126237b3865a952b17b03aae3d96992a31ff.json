Security headers are a way of\ntelling the browser how a website may behave when it's\nloaded into the client. They provide numerous defenses\nagainst a variety of attacks in ways that have not\npreviously been possible with security controls that ran\nsolely on the server. In this course, we'll walk through a\nnumber of essential security headers that provide even\ngreater levels of defense for web applications. We'll look\nat how they're intended to work, what attacks they protect\nagainst, and how you can easily implement them in your\nwebsite","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b19126237b3865a952b17b03aae3d96992a31ff","amp;dn":"PLURALSIGHT+INTRODUCTION+TO+BROWSER+SECURITY+HEADERS+TUTORIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b19126237b3865a952b17b03aae3d96992a31ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,25,18,98,55,179,134,90,149,43,23,176,58,174,61,150,153,42,49,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
