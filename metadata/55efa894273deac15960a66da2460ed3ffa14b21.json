Structures become more complex and informal speech is introduced. Conversations become fuller, and you learn to discuss business and social activities, manage shopping situations, and express your interests. As you progress, vocabulary is expanded and fluency increases.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The next 10 lessons of Level 2 allow you to further combine and build upon known elements, and produce longer and more complex sentences. You learn to bargain with shopkeepers, deal with business situations, get and give medical information, and discuss the weather.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In the final 10 lessons of Level 2, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve doubled your vocabulary and have several hundred structures to draw upon. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll gain experience asking for assistance, finding a location that is some distance away, and using relative structures Ã¢â‚¬â€œ faster, slower, etc. Sports and leisure activities are explored, as well as shopping, changing money, and future travel plans. By the end of Level 2, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re speaking at a mid-intermediate level with near-native pronunciation, and you are comfortable meeting most social demands and limited job requirements.\n\nReading lessons are included after Lesson 30. These lessons, which total about 80 minutes, give you practice reading Arabic and provide you with insight into Arab culture, common expressions, and a broad look at things youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see when visiting an Arabic-speaking country.\n\n\nContents:\n\n1.
