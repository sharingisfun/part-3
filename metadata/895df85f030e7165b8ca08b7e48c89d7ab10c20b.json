Like Sinatra's previous Capitol albums, Songs for Swingin' Lovers! consists of reinterpreted pop standards, ranging from the ten-year-old &quot;You Make Me Feel So Young&quot; to the 20-year-old &quot;Pennies From Heaven&quot; and &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin.&quot; Sinatra is supremely confident throughout the album, singing with authority and joy. That joy is replicated in Riddle's arrangements, which manage to rethink these standards in fresh yet reverent ways. Working with a core rhythm section and a full string orchestra, Riddle writes scores that are surprisingly subtle. &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin,&quot; with its breathtaking middle section, is a perfect example of how Sinatra works with the band. Both swing hard, stretching out the rhythms and melodies but never losing sight of the original song. Songs for Swingin' Lovers! never loses momentum. The great songs keep coming and the performances are all stellar, resulting in one of Sinatra's true classics. \n\n.: Locandina :.\n\n[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Songsforswinginlovers.jpg[/img]\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nLato A\n\nYou Make Me Feel So Young - 2:57 - (Myrow, Gordon)\nIt Happened in Monterey - 2:36 - (Wayne, Rose)\nYou're Getting to Be a Habit with Me - 2:19 - (Warren, Dubin)\nYou Brought a New Kind of Love to Me - 2:48 - (Fain, Kahal, Norman)\nToo Marvelous for Words - 2:29 - (Mercer, Whiting)\nOld Devil Moon - 3:56 - (Lane, Harburg)\nPennies from Heaven - 2:44 - (Johnston, Burke)\nLove Is Here to Stay - 2:42 - (Gershwin, Gershwin)\n\nLato B\n\nI've Got You Under My Skin - 3:43 - (Porter)\nI Thought About You - 2:30 - (Mercer, Van Heusen)\nWe'll Be Together Again - 4:26 - (Fischer, Laine)\nMakin' Whoopee - 3:06 - (Donaldson, Kahn)\nSwingin' Down the Lane - 2:54 - (Jones, Kahn)\nAnything Goes - 2:43 - (Porter)\nHow About You? - 2:45 - (Lane, Freed)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:895df85f030e7165b8ca08b7e48c89d7ab10c20b","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+Songs+For+Swingin+Lovers+%5BFLAC%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"895df85f030e7165b8ca08b7e48c89d7ab10c20b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,93,248,95,3,14,113,101,184,202,8,183,228,140,137,215,171,16,194,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
