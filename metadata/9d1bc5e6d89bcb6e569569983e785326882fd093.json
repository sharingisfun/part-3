For instance it's about twice as fast as UNetbootin, \r\n\r\nUniversal USB Installer or Windows 7 USB download tool, on the creation of a \r\n\r\nWindows 7 USB installation drive from an ISO. It is also marginally faster on \r\n\r\nthe creation of Linux bootable USB from ISOs. (1)\r\n A non exhaustive list of Rufus supported ISOs is also provided at the bottom \r\n\r\nof this page.

Once downloaded, the \r\n\r\napplication is ready to use.\r\n\r\nI will take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the translators who \r\n\r\nmade it possible for Rufus, as well as this webpage, to be translated in \r\n\r\nvarious languages. If you find that you can use Rufus in your own language, \r\n\r\nyou should really thank them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on DOS support:\r\n\r\nIf you create a DOS bootable drive and use a non-US keyboard, Rufus will \r\n\r\nattempt to select a keyboard layout according to the locale of your system. \r\n\r\nIn that case, FreeDOS, which is the default selection, is recommended over \r\n\r\nMS-DOS, as it supports more keyboard layouts.\r\n\r\nNotes on ISO Support:\r\n\r\nAll versions of Rufus since v1.1.0 allow the creation of a bootable USB from \r\n\r\nan ISO image (.iso).\r\n\r\nCreating an ISO image from a physical disc or from a set of files is very \r\n\r\neasy to do however, through the use of a CD burning application, such as the \r\n\r\nfreely available CDBurnerXP or ImgBurn.\r\n\r\nNotes on UEFI &amp; GPT support:\r\n\r\nSince version 1.3.2, Rufus support UEFI as well as GPT for installation \r\n\r\nmedia, meaning that it will allow you to install Windows 7, Windows 8 or \r\n\r\nLinux in full EFI mode.\r\n However, Windows Vista or later is required for full UEFI/GPT support. \r\n\r\nBecause of OS limitations, Windows XP restricts the creation of UEFI bootable \r\n\r\ndrives to MBR mode\r\n\r\n9:08 PM 9/2/2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1bc5e6d89bcb6e569569983e785326882fd093","amp;dn":"Rufus+2.10+create+bootable+USB+drives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1bc5e6d89bcb6e569569983e785326882fd093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,27,197,230,216,155,203,110,86,149,105,152,62,120,83,38,136,47,208,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
