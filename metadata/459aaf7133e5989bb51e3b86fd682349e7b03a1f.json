Against this background, Aidan Dodson reconsiders the evidence and proposes a number of new solutions to the problems of the period. He also considers the art, architecture, and archaeology of the period, including the royal tombs of Tanis, one of which yielded the intact burials of no fewer than five pharaohs. The book is extensively illustrated with images of this material, much of which is little known to non-specialists of the period","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:459aaf7133e5989bb51e3b86fd682349e7b03a1f","amp;dn":"Afterglow+of+Empire%3A+Egypt+from+the+Fall+of+the+New+Kingdom+...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"459aaf7133e5989bb51e3b86fd682349e7b03a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,154,175,113,51,229,152,155,181,30,59,134,253,104,35,73,231,176,58,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
