Coltrane was playing with Miles Davis, Burrell was a highly respected sideman, able to fit seamlessly into any context, who also recorded sturdy sessions as a leader.\n \nHere they are supported by an all-star cast of Paul Chambers (bass), Jimmy Cobb (drums), and Tommy Flanagan (piano).\n\n What makes this record stand out is the contributions of all five members, who seem to have an equal amount invested in it; this record, which could easily turn into a showcase for the two leaders, ends up as a group effort where everyone gets a chance in the spotlight. Coltrane and Burrell frequently trade off the first solo chair, never hogging the spotlight. The end result is a record in which the best is brought out in five musicians rather than three musicians helping two reach new heights.\n\nThis is but one example of many sessions when Coltrane broke away from Miles Davis, taking along his sideman for a fantastical musical adventure.\n\n\n\n\nKenny Burrell / John Coltrane\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Kenny Burrell &amp; John ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRecorded in 1958, released in 1963\n\n\n \n\n CD / 2006 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n Freight Train\n\n I Never Knew\n\n Lyresto\n\n Why Was I Born?\n\n Big Paul\n\n\n\n Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ on March 7th, 1958\n\n\n\nPersonnel: \n\n Kenny Burrell, guitar\n\n John Coltrane, tenor saxophone\n\n Tommy Flanagan, piano\n\n Paul Chambers, bass\n\n Jimmy Cobb, drums\n\n\n\nKenny Burrell / John Coltrane\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Kenny Burrell &amp; John ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nRecorded in 1958, released in 1963","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b6c1a6912aa79118a996a2dda61bf2d3119878e","amp;dn":"Kenny+Burrell+%26amp%3B+John+Coltrane+%281958%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b6c1a6912aa79118a996a2dda61bf2d3119878e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,108,26,105,18,170,121,17,138,153,106,45,218,97,191,45,49,25,135,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
