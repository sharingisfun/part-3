Its release is good news for anyone who couldn\\&amp;#039;t tackle the downloads for whatever reason. It\\&amp;#039;s also good news for those of us who want to add yet another box to the shelf to build our game collection.\n\nSo if you\\&amp;#039;re a Sam &amp; Max fan and haven\\&amp;#039;t played the recent episodes, then this is your big chance. In fact you don\\&amp;#039;t need to be a fan, or even a game player, because Sam (the smart dog in a suit) &amp; Max (the frenetic white rabbity thing) are sure to win you over right from the very start. This game is such a giggle it would make a great introduction to adventure games. It\\&amp;#039;s simple point and click, suitable for everyone, so if you own a computer why not join in and have a laugh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae10c7fd824d9b7184b6ea7ae420ae1c490436c","amp;dn":"Sam.and.Max.Season.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae10c7fd824d9b7184b6ea7ae420ae1c490436c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,225,12,127,216,36,217,183,24,75,110,167,174,66,10,225,196,144,67,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
