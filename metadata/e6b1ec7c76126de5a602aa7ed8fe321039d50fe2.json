It is a practical guide, primarily explaining how things are done by practicing engineers. Equations are used only for practical calculations, and are kept to the level of high-school algebra. There are numerous drawings and schematics showing how things such as measurements are actually made, and showing circuits that actually work. There are practical notes and examples embedded in the text that give pointers and how-to guides on many of the book's topics. After reading each chapter of the book, readers will have the knowledge to implement practical designs. This book will be kept as a reference tool for years to come.\n\n\nBy Ron Lenk, Carol Lenk\nPublished by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 2011\nEPUB, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b1ec7c76126de5a602aa7ed8fe321039d50fe2","amp;dn":"Practical+Lighting+Design+with+LEDs+%28ePUB%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b1ec7c76126de5a602aa7ed8fe321039d50fe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,177,236,124,118,18,109,229,166,2,170,126,216,254,50,16,57,213,15,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
