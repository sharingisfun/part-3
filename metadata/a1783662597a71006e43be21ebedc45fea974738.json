In addition to a similar looking main character, the game's development team consisted of former employees of Climax Entertainment. The gameplay includes a combination of top-down platforming, action-adventure, and RPG elements, quite similar to Zelda series. It is known for containing many extremely difficult puzzles, some of which cannot be accessed if the player progresses further in the game, making some items unattainable.[citation needed] It is also known for its dark storyline and music.[citation needed] A range of terrain and surfaces also add variety, from sand, which causes the player to move more slowly, to lava, which damages the player. Upgrades throughout the game can help the player to overcome many of these obstacles, encouraging exploration.\n\nPLOT:\nThe game starts with Alundra being on a ship. After walking around and talking to the people, Alundra decides to take a nap. He has a mysterious dream where a strange being named Lars tells him that he is a wizard and one of the guardians of the seal. Suddenly, Alundra sees a vision from the village of Inoa. After that, Lars calls Alundra 'Releaser' and tells him that north of the village there is a dark lake and below it there has lied a demon for over 1000 years and now the demon has awakened once more. After telling this, a creature named Melzas appears and points out that nobody has the power to stop him, especially not a human like Alundra. After talking with Lars about humans and the 'Releaser', Melzas disappears. Lars tells Alundra to travel to Inoa and stop the demon.\nSuddenly Alundra wakes up and after getting out of his cabin, he finds out that there is a huge storm above the ship. The captain tells the crew not to worry but they sail into the reef and the ship breaks from the middle. After this Alundra loses consciousness.\nAlundra wakes up from a beach and a man named Jess comes and rescues him. Jess takes Alundra to his house and lets him sleep upstairs. In the village of Inoa, Alundra discovers he is a Dreamwalker and undertakes many quests, playing both in people's dreams and the village surroundings. Soon, he finds out he is the 'Releaser', destined to save the world from Melzas, an ancient demon on his quest to world domination, who is also responsible for people's nightmares.\n\nCHARACTERS:\n    * Alundra, the protagonist and player character, is an elf from the clan of Elna, the Dreamwalkers. He comes to Inoa because of a recurring dream in which a mysterious figure who calls Alundra &quot;Releaser&quot; tells him that he must save the villagers from the evil of Melzas. His ship is caught in a storm and he is later found washed ashore unconscious. After arriving, he starts being blamed by the townsfolk for all of the terrible happenings that occur. Alundra is a silent protagonist.\n    * Meia is also part of the clan of Elna. She is also seeking to destroy Melzas. She has a troubled past that is eventually revealed during the course of the game.\n    * Jess is the blacksmith in Inoa. After Alundra's ship is swept ashore and destroyed in a storm, Jess finds the unconscious Alundra and takes care of him for as long as he remains in Inoa. He is good-natured and always trusts Alundra, even when others do not.\n    * Septimus is a scholar and a close friend of Alundra. He travelled to Inoa to help lift the curse that has afflicted it, but has met with little success. He helps Alundra discover many ancient and forgotten secrets of the world and his power of dreamwalking.\n\nANTAGONISTS:\n    * Melzas is an ancient and powerful demon. Though he was imprisoned long ago by the Guardians of the Seal, he has returned and is terrorizing the villagers of Inoa. He is the primary villain of the storyline.\n    * Ronan is the priest of the village's church, the Sanctuary. From Alundra's first arrival in Inoa, Ronan constantly acts to turn the villagers against him. He has a hidden agenda and secretly praying for Melzas when the church is locked.\n    * Zazan is the leader of a clan of white monkey-like creatures known as the Murgg. He is being commanded by Melzas to destroy Inoa and steal the seven crests.\n    * Zorgia is a powerful demon and a servant of Melzas. He is vicious, cruel, sadistic, and utterly loyal to his master.\n-----------------------\n-----------------------\n-----------------------\n\nALUNDRA 2:\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAlundra 2 is an action-adventure game with role-playing and puzzle elements. There is an emphasis on puzzle solving and dungeon exploring.\n\nSTORY:\nAlundra 2's story is set in the kingdom of Varuna. A powerful sorcerer Mephisto is using magical wind-up keys to control humans and turn animals into powerful killing machines. You play Flint, a young hero and Pirate Hunter who is wanted for treason, and is after the pirates that caused his parents' death.\nYou begin the game on board a flying ship, where you discover that not only is the Baron working with pirates, but also that Flint has a bounty on his head. After a rumble with pirates and a few robots, Flint falls into the ocean and the ship is left to crash. Flint wakes up in a village and is recruited by Princess Alexia and Lord Prunewell to fight against the Baron.\nFlint and Alexia run into Mephisto while investigating the crashed plane Flint had been on; it is here Mephisto demonstrates his wizardry by transforming a cat into a monster by stabbing a key into its neck (and transforms back once defeated). Shortly after the battle, the village is bombed; leaving Flint to investigate a mechanical, bull-shaped tank. Once again, Flint is left to dispatch a mechanical bull that also seems to have been changed by Mephisto. This string of events then leads Flint and Alexia to a factory that a villager claims to be a place of untold happiness. Once inside, Flint and Alexia witness that same villager being transformed magically into a robot using a key. Alexia is then kidnapped, leaving Flint to take on another monster (this time a woman who transforms into a gigantic spider. Afterwords Flint and Alexia arrive in a port, where they plot to sneak over to the pirates' secret hideaway.\nAfter they sneak inside they discover that the pirates indeed are working for the Baron. Flint is then discovered and confronted by a mysterious man, the personal guard of Mileena, who spares Flint's life and throws him out of the palace. Shortly after, Alexia is (again) kidnapped and taken to the Baron. Skipping the spoilers, Flint finds himself inside an underwater cave, where he meets up with lord Prunewell again (who, for some reason, has all the children of the royal court with him). With Flint to rally behind, the group makes plans to take the kingdom back by force; this is quickly thwarted as the scene changes to the entire group in the dungeon. The Baron then makes Flint an offer (using Alexia's life as reassurance) for his freedom in exchange for his services.\nAfter meeting up with Zeppo (by the Baron's orders), Flint arrives at Eden Village, where he is left to face yet again another puzzle-solving dungeon to obtain something for the Baron. When Flint goes to sail back, however, a mechanical whale swallows his ship. Once Flint escapes, he then begins to investigate the Church of the Key, another area of Mephisto's power.\nAfter several more dungeons (and not much more discovered), Flint (after a quick round against a mutated Zeppo) ultimately confronts Mephisto, who uses several forms to match Flint.\n\nCHARACTERS:\n    * Flint: His family was killed by a group of pirates, and he's been hunting them ever since. He's also a wanted man in the Kingdom of Varuna.\n\n    * Alexia: Princess of Varuna. She's searching for her father, the King of Varuna.\n\n    * Lord Prunewell: The old servant of Alexia, appears near the start of the game. He has spies that are watching Flint for him.\n\n    * Zeppo: The leader of the pirate family. Mileena's husband.\n\n    * Ruby: Daughter of Zeppo. Extremely bossy and hot-tempered. Mileena's daughter.\n\n    * Albert: Son of Zeppo. Quiet and calm. Mileena's son.\n\n    * Mephisto: The master of the magic screw.

Desperately wants to marry Princess Alexia.\n\n    * Nunugi: Assistant/bodyguard to Baron Diaz.\n\n    * Miyagi: Nunugi's brother, Can be seen at the Ending.\n\n    * Natasha: The Baron's well-meaning daughter.\n\n    * Mileena: The pirate queen, and also the mother of Ruby and Albert.
