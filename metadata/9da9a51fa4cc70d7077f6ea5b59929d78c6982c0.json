It features hundreds of eyewitness accounts from frontline soldiers, generals, statesmen, children and women from all sides in the conflict. The First World War shaped the twentieth century. It sparked the Russian Revolution and launched America as a world power. The fault-line from its failed peace settlement led to a second terrible world war barely twenty years later. We live with its unresolved consequences; in the Middle East, the Balkans and Ireland.\nOriginally shown on Channel 4 in 2003.\n\n7) Blockade\nThe British expected a second Trafalgar, but within days German submarines turned the North Sea into a no-go area for Britain's great battleships. The British responded with a blockade of Europe to starve the enemy out. Germany launched submarine attacks against civilian ships, including the Lusitania with 1,200 lives lost. American acted as arsenal and banker to the warring nations, but, though targeted by spies and saboteurs, was deeply reluctant to join in. Then top secret British code-breakers deciphered the Zimmermann Telegram which revealed that Germany was encouraging Mexico to attack America. Now America joined the First World War.\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;baf2d3ddd2faf68e948b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3860Kbps)\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.41 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 50 mins\n * Number Of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 1.39 GB (average)\n * Source: HDTV (upscaled)\n * Encoded by: JungleBoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9da9a51fa4cc70d7077f6ea5b59929d78c6982c0","amp;dn":"BBC+The+First+World+War+07of10+Blockade+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9da9a51fa4cc70d7077f6ea5b59929d78c6982c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,169,165,31,164,204,112,215,7,127,110,165,181,153,41,215,140,105,130,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
