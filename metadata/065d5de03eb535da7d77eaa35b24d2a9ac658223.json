She created an aristocratic, unassuming detective called Albert Campion, who matured from &quot;just a silly ass&quot; of the 1920s to an eminent intelligence veteran forty years later. He ranks high among the great detectives of fiction but does so unobtrusively, disdaining self-advertisement. Other recurrent characters contribute richly to the Campion series: Campion's wife, Amanda; his manservant, Lugg; and his police associates, Stanislaus Oates and Charlie Luke. The novels and stories in which they appear are among the most distinguished in the genre Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vivacious, stylish, observant, shapely, intricate and witty. They are unfailingly intelligent and imaginative, even when they do not wholly succeed.\n\nAllingham regarded the mystery novel as a box with four sides - &quot;a Killing, a Mystery, an Enquiry and a Conclusion with an element of satisfaction in it.&quot; Once inside the box, she felt secure: the genre gave her the discipline she felt she needed, while allowing her imagination full play to provide the &quot;Element of Satisfaction.&quot; This she abundantly did from her first crime novel in 1928 to her last in 1968.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065d5de03eb535da7d77eaa35b24d2a9ac658223","amp;dn":"Margery+Allingham+-+Mystery+Novels+and+Short+Stories+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065d5de03eb535da7d77eaa35b24d2a9ac658223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,93,93,224,62,181,53,218,125,119,234,163,91,36,210,169,172,101,130,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
