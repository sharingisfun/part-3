Although his course on alchemy and kabbalah were finished over 25 years ago, they are still considered by many to be the finest works of their type ever published.\n\nWhat many people don't understand, however, is that these works were designed to be studied in a specific order. Many of the later books assume one has read and understands the previous works.\n\nThese books can be found online, but I have not seen them presented in their proper order. No doubt this has caused problems, and I suspect many have given up in frustration, thinking the course too complex to understand and master.\n\nI have assembled the complete course (all in pdf format) and offer them here in the correct order. I have also included his most recent work, which builds upon his earlier material while presenting a fresh perspective.\n\nPart 1 - Fundamentals\n   Dubuis, Jean - The Fundamentals Of Esoteric Knowledge\n\nPart 2 - Spagyrics  (Plant Alchemy)\n   Dubuis, Jean - Spagyrics Vol 1\n   Dubuis, Jean - Spagyrics Vol 2\n\nPart 3 - Mineral Alchemy\n   Dubuis, Jean - Mineral Alchemy Vol 1\n   Dubuis, Jean - Mineral Alchemy Vol 2\n   Dubuis, Jean - Mineral Alchemy Vol 3\n   Dubuis, Jean - Mineral Alchemy Vol 4\n\nPart 4 - Kabbalah (Qabala)\n   Dubuis, Jean - Qabala, The Philosophers of Nature Vol 1\n   Dubuis, Jean - Qabala, The Philosophers of Nature Vol 2\n   Dubuis, Jean - Qabala, The Philosophers of Nature Vol 3\n\nPart 5 - Additional Material\n   Dubuis, Jean - The Experience of Eternity\n\n\n\nNote: I will be adding many more titles soon, Search for &quot;EarthBow&quot; for a list of available titles.\n\nAs always, comments (good or bad) are appreciated\n\nKeywords: esoteric, occult, alchemy, spagyrics, PON, kabbalah, qabala, qabbala, qabbalah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca68317bbae895a84e8283e8e188a973b3d6254","amp;dn":"Occult+-+Jean+Dubuis+Alchemy+Course+%28pdf%29+EarthBow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca68317bbae895a84e8283e8e188a973b3d6254","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,166,131,23,187,174,137,90,132,232,40,62,142,24,138,151,59,61,98,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
