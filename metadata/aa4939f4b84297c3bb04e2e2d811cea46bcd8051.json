Clyde Stubblefield and John &quot;JabÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢o&quot; Starks.\n\nOn their own or in tandem, Starks and Stubblefield were the principal drummers for the Godfather of Soul and Funk, Mr. James Brown. Fans and critics alike cite their collective era in BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band as the pinnacle of Funk. Their combined drumming on the classic double-album &quot;Sex Machine&quot; is some of the most innovative, inspired and funky playing ever recorded.\n\nSamples and looped audio of their original beats and breaks would go on to become the foundation of Hip-Hop. Their breaks gave birth to countless genres reaching deep into the realms of underground, experimental and popular music. It is also crucial to note that the use of their breaks inspired innovation within the techniques of DJ-ing and sample based production, thus making Starks and Stubblefield the most sampled and influential drummers in modern day music.\n\nToontrackÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Music has sampled both their unique sound and grooves. Musicians, Producers and DJ&amp;#039;s will be amazed by the depth of soul found within these samples. From the tight sizzle of the hi-hats to the snap and crack of the snares, our unique sampler engine reveals the subtle mastery of these drummers in ways never available before. The included MIDI will inevitably become the backbone to a new generation of Digital Jockeys generations to come.\n\nWe at ToontrackÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Music are honored and humbled to have worked with these masters. As fans and lovers of music, we wish to express our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the legacy that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJabÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢oÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Clyde have given us all.\n\nThe Funkmasters EZXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® feature two kit interfaces, one for Clyde and one for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½JabÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢oÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
