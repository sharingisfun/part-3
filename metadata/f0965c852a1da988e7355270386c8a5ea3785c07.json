A focus is placed on the principles and practices of decomposing a complex problem space as well as the implementation patterns and best practices for shaping a maintainable solution space. You will learn how to build effective domain models through the use of tactical patterns and how to retain their integrity by applying the strategic patterns of DDD. Full end-to-end coding examples demonstrate techniques for integrating a decomposed and distributed solution space while coding best practices and patterns advise you on how to architect applications for maintenance and scale. * Offers a thorough introduction to the philosophy of DDD for professional developers * Includes masses of code and examples of concept in action that other books have only covered theoretically * Covers the patterns of CQRS, Messaging, REST, Event Sourcing and Event-Driven Architectures * Also ideal for Java developers who want to better understand the implementation of DDD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0965c852a1da988e7355270386c8a5ea3785c07","amp;dn":"Patterns%2C+Principles+and+Practices+of+Domain-Driven+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0965c852a1da988e7355270386c8a5ea3785c07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,150,92,133,42,29,169,136,231,53,82,112,56,108,138,94,163,120,92,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
