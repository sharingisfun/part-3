When the Duke of Athens tries to enforce the marriage, the lovers take refuge in the woods and wander into the midst of a dispute between the king and queen of the fairies. Shakespeare put some of his most dazzling dramatic poetry at the service of this teasing, glittering, hilarious and amazingly inventive play, whose seriousness is only fleetingly glimpsed beneath its dreamlike surface.\n\nMy notes\n\n   The good news is that here is another in the series of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre with one of the most performed and beloved of the canon.  Even these many years later there are likely many in the British audience who remember Peter Brook's stunning take on the play.  It's something I've only read about.  And the Ambrose BBC Complete Shakespeare on DVD is my referent for the play moreso than the older films such as the one with Mickey Rooney as Puck  (1940)  or another which Judy Dench played in the 60's and whose screen shots can still be found at the movie database.  She played Titania nude, you see, and on broadcast television while everyone else had on &quot;Bonanza.&quot;  It's all true.  I remember it as a young man.\n\n In this production Puck is the obvious favorite.  Everybody has their favorites in the Globe shows.  Gemma Jones' Helena in the Ambrose Shakespeare was mine in that production.  Elsewhere and in yet other settings  Diana Rigg  played Hermia.  Staying with the Globe productions as I have the treat is seeing regulars like Michelle Terry (Love's Labors Lost)  Sarah MacRae  (Taming of the Shrew and the BBC's Duchess of Malfi at the Globe), Pierce Quigley (Dr.Faustus, Taming of the Shrew ) Fergel Elherron (Loves Labor's Lost)  Olivia Ross (Henry V.)   All these players seem endlessly at the height of their abilities.\n\n  It's in two parts and here again I made the attempt to bring forward the speaking roles and match audio levels. \n\n  Watch for the bit of clog dancing which introduces the Pyramus and Thisbe players.  Some may think of Riverdance but I recall Dien Perry's Tap Dogs both on film and live at the theatre where I live.  Many bits of business stand out but that is my favorite.\n\n  Nothing new has been added to the dvd list at the Globe following this release.\nPerhaps there will be a Globe favorite: &quot;Measure For Measure&quot; for example or the Globe Around the Globe Hamlet (which would still be sometime further out.)  I'll watch for the newer releases and you do the same.  Seek out the DVD's available in NTSC and PAL formats and get them for your local libraries.\n\nNotes written May 1, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76a3f72ff7e1470ed02e9ce2de74db121d5832e7","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+A+Midsummer+Night%27s+Dream+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76a3f72ff7e1470ed02e9ce2de74db121d5832e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,163,247,47,247,225,71,14,208,46,156,226,222,116,219,18,29,88,50,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
