No way Jose.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDestroyer is a band consisting of Daniel Bejar who is only one man. As you may have figured out, Destroyer isn\\&amp;#039;t really a band after all. But it is almost a band, come on go along with it. Yeah. \n\nSo this is an album called Your Blues and it is rate nice.\n\nOh yeah, the Destroyer-man also did stuff with New Pornographers which is awesome and features Neko Case (wicked) and Carl Newman (he is the shit). And Bejar also \\&quot;joined together with members of Frog Eyes and Wolf Parade to create another indie supergroup known as Swan Lake\\&quot; recently.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Blues&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Blues&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPitchfork reviewed and approved http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16988-your-blues\n\nThe album is from 2004 and quote quote:\n\n\\&quot;It has been variously described by critics as \\&quot;some kind of masterpiece, the work of a truly original and iconoclastic talent\\&quot;, \\&quot;a bold step in a new direction, risking over-the-top theatricality, but with its feet planted firmly on solid ground\\&quot;, \\&quot;seeming like a work in progress\\&quot; and \\&quot;an acquired taste\\&quot;.\n\nWhile, with its Metacritic \\&quot;Metascore\\&quot; of 79 out of 100, it could be considered to be critically well-received, frontman Dan Bejar conceded that it may be viewed by some as a \\&quot;half-baked exercise\\&quot;, and the MIDI instrumentation as \\&quot;completely hokey and completely sabotaging the legitimacy of the songs\\&quot;.\n\nTracklist:\n\n   1. \\&quot;Notorious Lightning\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 5:57\n   2. \\&quot;It\\&amp;#039;s Gonna Take an Airplane\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:41\n   3. \\&quot;An Actor\\&amp;#039;s Revenge\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:57\n   4. \\&quot;The Music Lovers\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:22\n   5. \\&quot;From Oakland to Warsaw\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:11\n   6. \\&quot;Your Blues\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:57\n   7. \\&quot;New Ways of Living\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:23\n   8. \\&quot;Don\\&amp;#039;t Become the Thing You Hated\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2:13\n   9. \\&quot;Mad Foxes\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:45\n  10. \\&quot;The Fox and the Hound\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:23\n  11. \\&quot;What Road\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:57\n  12. \\&quot;Certain Things You Ought to Know\\&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:25\n\nMP3 192 kbps and all files properly tagged for iTunes.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da4da1fc6f27d326983fac7438d3e1e1d79260a","amp;dn":"Destroyer+-+Your+Blues+%282004%29+-+192kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da4da1fc6f27d326983fac7438d3e1e1d79260a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,164,218,31,198,242,125,50,105,131,250,199,67,141,62,30,29,121,38,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
