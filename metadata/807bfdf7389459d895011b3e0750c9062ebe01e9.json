This generational change is emphasized and explored with updated content featuring tablet computers, cloud infrastructure, and the ARM (mobile computing devices) and x86 (cloud computing) architectures.\n\nBecause an understanding of modern hardware is essential to achieving good performance and energy efficiency, this edition adds a new concrete example, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going Faster,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ used throughout the text to demonstrate extremely effective optimization techniques. Also new to this edition is discussion of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eight Great IdeasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of computer architecture.\n\nAs with previous editions, a MIPS processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O.\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChapter 1.
