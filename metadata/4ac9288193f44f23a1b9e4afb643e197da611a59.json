The best and most obvious example of his abilities is Comedy CentralÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s short-lived Important Things With Demetri Martin, a multi-faceted showcase for the comedianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minimalistic yet cerebral comedy. MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, 2006Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s These Are Jokes, plays no less like a variety show, featuring guest spots (including MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandmother), Easter eggs, and songs. His book, This Is A Book, shows his skill with palindromes. But as evidenced on Standup ComedianÃ¢â‚¬â€his first stand-up album since 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Demetri Martin. Person. and first recorded work since Important Things left the air in 2010Ã¢â‚¬â€the more Martin amuses himself with gimmickry, and the farther he moves from his roots as a one-liner savant, the harder it can be to come back.\n\nOn Comedian, Martin abstains from many of his stylistic props: no whiteboard, no guests, few frills. (It could be argued this is a necessity for the CD version, but past albums are hardly this bare-bones.) Other than the self-introduction and closing track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guitar, Jokes,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Comedian is largely a traditional stand-up set. The album is split into distinct halves, with the first part containing longer, elaborate bits that blend MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playful prankster streak with his eye for linguistic and cultural ironies, and follow his non sequiturs to their unlikely conclusions. One punchline shifts a jokeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premise from clumsiness to fatalism; a complaint about Ã¢â‚¬Å“looking like a shitty magicianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when using automatic towel dispensers reveals an entire sketch on unnecessary conveniencesÃ¢â‚¬â€a biting appraisal and the first halfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-written material. In place of visual support, Martin creates imaginative scenarios for his dry wit to run rampant, which carries the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearly flawless first half. The cracks emerge when the album transitions into its second half, a series of one-liners and short quips.\n\nIn spite of his renown as a polymath, Martin is perhaps most celebrated for his way with a memorable one-liner, which has garnered comparisons to Steven Wright and Mitch Hedberg. The material on Comedian occasionally reaches those heightsÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly on consistent tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Concerts,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yep,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flavors,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or whenever heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s working blueÃ¢â‚¬â€but the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s low points stand in stark contrast. Four tracks in particularÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½OK,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silent Letters,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Senses, HalloweenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€vary from mildly unfunny to glaringly hacky. Lazy setups like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You can tell youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not doing well in life whenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are a dime a dozen, and a joke at the expense of the WNBA is just too easy. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simple enough to ignore underwritten or unoriginal jokes if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re isolated; unfortunately, the album is hit-or-miss by track, with the better material bookending the sagging middle.\n\nStandup Comedian is curiously contradictory. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at its strongest during the first halfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narratives and the last trackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deluge of one-liners, but a weak hybrid of the two occupies most of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running time. Additionally, the impersonal material and MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unwaveringly dry delivery make it feel anonymous, as though a friend at a party is reading from a joke book. Martin is clearly operating outside most of the comedy world, and as frustrating as it can be to experience his missteps, a flawed album thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant and lazy in equal parts is always preferable to one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s generic and unmemorable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac9288193f44f23a1b9e4afb643e197da611a59","amp;dn":"Demetri+Martin+-+Standup+Comedian+%5B192%5D+%282012+comedy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac9288193f44f23a1b9e4afb643e197da611a59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,201,40,129,147,244,79,35,161,185,228,175,182,67,225,151,218,97,26,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
