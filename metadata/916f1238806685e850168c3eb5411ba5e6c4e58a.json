The Second Edition addresses tough physiology topics with new and revised two-page modules and corresponding new Coaching Activities in MasteringA&amp;PÃ‚Â®. Brand-new end-of-chapter study and practice materials include a narrative Study Outline and comprehensive Chapter Review Questions. Module Reviews and Section Reviews, appearing throughout each chapter, give students additional tools for learning. In response to the strong demand from A&amp;P instructors, a brand-new Visual Anatomy &amp; Physiology Lab Manual uses the same visual approach and modular organization to help students succeed in the lab.\n\nThis program presents a better teaching and learning experience by providing:\n\nPersonalized learning with MasteringA&amp;P: Engage students with new Ã¢â‚¬Å“tough topicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Coaching Activities and a wide range of other question and activity typesÃ¢â‚¬â€all automatically graded.\n\nA visual approach and modular organization: The two-page modules seamlessly integrate text and visuals to guide students through complex topics and processes with no page flipping. The addition of new content in select modules gives students a better understanding of physiology. \n\nFrequent practice: Review questions at the end of each module, section, and chapter encourage and support student practice. In the Second Edition, the Chapter Review includes a new narrative Study Outline and new comprehensive Chapter Review questions. Students can continue practicing with MasteringA&amp;P.\n\nLearning outcomes that tightly coordinate with teaching points: The clean one-to-one correspondence between the numbered chapter-opening Learning Outcomes and the numbered two-page modules give students an easy learning path and instructors an easy vehicle for assessment. \n\nStreamlined learning in the lab: The new Visual Anatomy &amp; Physiology Lab Manual uses the same visual approach and modular organization to help students succeed in the lab.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:916f1238806685e850168c3eb5411ba5e6c4e58a","amp;dn":"Visual+Anatomy+and+Physiology%2C+2E-+Martini+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"916f1238806685e850168c3eb5411ba5e6c4e58a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,111,18,56,128,102,133,232,80,22,140,62,181,65,27,165,230,196,229,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
