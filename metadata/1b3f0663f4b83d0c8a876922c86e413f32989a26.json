Since then, she's made sporadic appearances on songs from Vetiver, Bert Jansch, Richard X, Death In Vegas and Air, which has only added to the surprise surrounding the release of Through The Devil Softly. Sandoval has once again teamed up with My Bloody Valentine drummer, Colm O Ciosoig, just as they did on 2001's Bavarian Fruit Bread, and if the first leaked song, &quot;Blanchard,&quot; is any indication, the new album looks to continue much in the same abstract, swooning, folky vein.\n\n   1.
