On August 20th, 1973, police were dispatched to the remote farmhouse of Thomas Hewitt, the former head-skinner at a local slaughterhouse in Travis County, Texas. What they found within the confines of the cryptic residence was the butchered remains of 33 human victims, a chilling discovery that shocked and horrified a nation in what many still refer to as the most notorious mass murder case of all time. Wearing the grotesque flesh masks of his victims and brandishing a chainsaw, the killer, known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLeatherface,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ would gain infamy when sensational headlines were splashed across newspapers throughout the state of Texas: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHouse of Terror Stuns Nation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Massacre in Texas.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Local authorities would eventually gun down a man wearing a leathery mask and declare they had their killer, which abruptly closed the case; however, in the years that followed, many close to the grisly murder case would come forward to level accusations that police had botched the investigation and knowingly killed the wrong man. Now, for the first time, the only known survivor of the killing spree has broken the silence and come forward to tell the real story of what happened on a deserted rural Texas highway when a group of five young kids inadvertently found themselves besieged by a chainsaw-wielding madman, one who would leave a trail of blood and terror that would forever become known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ New Line Cinema presents The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a terrifying journey into a heart of unimaginable darkness as five young adults are stranded in a rural Texas town, only to find themselves fighting for their lives against Leatherface and his bizarre clan. Inspired by the 1974 classic film of the same name, the new film stars Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel and Eric Balfour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac622b83064595f6214a33697e39844a8218121a","amp;dn":"The+Texas+Chainsaw+Massacre%282003%29%28DvdRip.Xvid%29-BRIDOG-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac622b83064595f6214a33697e39844a8218121a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,98,43,131,6,69,149,246,33,74,51,105,126,57,132,74,130,24,18,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
