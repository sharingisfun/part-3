Of course, as the rest of Greece, it has a long, often bloody and very rich history that is clearly visible all over the island.\nIoannis Kapodistrias International Airport is a typical holiday airport. Off season itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quiet with just a few flights every day while in the holiday season (and certainly on Monday and Friday) the airport is running at full capacity. The runway is built in a small bay and the approach from the south is spectacular as some of the best known landmarks are only a few hundred meters away. Though weather conditions are seldom a problem, wind can be an issue as it flows around and over the mountains that are close to the airport. In high summer turbulence can be severe close to the ground. As the runway has no ILS, all approaches are visual and certain the VOR DME NDB approach to runway 35 is not easy.\nLiVEinFSX modeled this airport using the latest insights in scenery design. But what makes this a special project is not the technology but the keen eye for detail and obvious love for the Greek islands that is clearly visible.
