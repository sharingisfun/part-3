It is now a very widely-used term, but there is still a lot of confusion surrounding what it actually is and does.\n\nEpigenetics is a new textbook that brings together the structure and machinery of epigenetic modification, how epigenetic modification controls cellular functions, and the evidence for the relationship between epigenetics and disease. It is a valuable source of information about all aspects of the subject for undergraduate students, graduate students, and professionals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:292bc8e8dc8d2a0bc5e96275bd7b9cbab00db755","amp;dn":"Epigenetics-+Lyle+Armstrong+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"292bc8e8dc8d2a0bc5e96275bd7b9cbab00db755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,43,200,232,220,141,42,11,197,233,98,117,189,123,156,186,176,13,183,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
