Protecting web applications from these attacks has become an essential skill for all PHP developers. Creating Secure PHP Websites shows you how to meet the most important security challenges when developing websites with PHP. Instructor Kevin Skoglund covers the techniques and PHP code needed to develop sites that are more secure, and to avoid common mistakes. Learn how to configure PHP properly and filter input and escape output. Then check out step-by-step defenses against the most common forms of attack, and the best practices to use for encryption and user authentication.\n\nTopics include:\n\n    Cross-site scripting (XSS)\n    Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)\n    SQL injection\n    Encrypting and signing cookies\n    Session hijacking and fixation\n    Securing uploaded files\n    User authentication\n    Throttling brute-force attacks\n    Blacklisting IPs\n    Implementing password reset tokens\n\n\n\n          |-----------------------------------------------------------|\n          |                     UPLOADER INFO                         |\n          |                                                           |\n          |  Lynda.com - Creating Secure PHP Websites - [Torrenters]  |\n          |                                                           |\n          |-----------------------------------------------------------|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:514ac56af5a34b59cfc8ed5a864e60ebd4426711","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Creating+Secure+PHP+Websites","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"514ac56af5a34b59cfc8ed5a864e60ebd4426711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,74,197,106,245,163,75,89,207,200,237,90,134,78,96,235,212,66,103,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
