This tour saw Gilmour backed by essentially the same core band members that joined him on the last Pink Floyd tour, with the biggest exception being Nick Mason missing from behind the drum kit. Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright was the co-star of the tour.\nSeveral guest stars also joined Gilmour on this tour, most notably David Crosby and Graham Nash, who also provided gorgeous backing vocals on the new album. David Bowie also takes the lead vocals on &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; to close out one of the shows.  \nTRACK LISTS:  \n1. Speak To Me\n2. Breathe\n3. Time\n4.
