The Craft of the Cocktail provides much more than merely the same old recipes: it delves into history, personalities, and anecdotes; it shows you how to set up a bar, master important techniques, and use tools correctly; and it delivers unique concoctions, many featuring Dale DeGroffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature use of fresh juices, as well as all the classics.\n\nDebonair, a great raconteur, and an unparalleled authority, Dale DeGroff is the epitome of Perfect Bartender, universally acknowledged as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s premier mixologist. From Entertainment Weekly and USA Today to the Culinary Institute of America and the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best restaurants, whenever anybody wants information or training on the bar, they turn to Dale for recipes, for history, for anecdotes, for funÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for cocktail-party conversation as well as for cocktails.\n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what The Craft of the Cocktail isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the full party, conversation and all. It begins with the history of spirits, how theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re made (but without too much boring science), the development of the mixed drink, and the culture it created, all drawn from DaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vast library of vintage cocktail books. Then on to stocking the essential bar, choosing the right tools and ingredients, mastering key techniquesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½hints worthy of a pro, the same information that Dale shares with the bartenders he trains in seminars and through his videos. And then the meat of the matter: 500 recipes, including everything from tried-and-true classics to of-the-moment originals. Throughout are rich stories, vintage recipes, fast facts, and other entertaining asides. Beautiful color photographs and a striking design round out the cookbook approach to this subject, highlighting the difference between an under-the-bar handbook and a stylish, full-blown treatment. The Craft of the Cocktail is that treatment, destined to become the bible of the bar.\n\n\nAuthor(s):\tDale DeGroff\nPublisher:\tClarkson Potter\nDate:\t2002-10-15\nPages:\t240\nFormat:\tPDF + EPUB\t\nISBN10:\t0609608754","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ef888e33fdfa048b5176599f9d02237494a4bc3","amp;dn":"The+Craft+of+the+Cocktail++%28+500+recipes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ef888e33fdfa048b5176599f9d02237494a4bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,248,136,227,63,223,160,72,181,23,101,153,249,208,34,55,73,74,75,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
