The group was formed in Toronto in 1985 by Margo Timmins (vocalist), Michael Timmins (songwriter, guitarist), Peter Timmins (drummer) and Alan Anton (bassist).\nThe Junkies first performed publicly at the Beverley Tavern and other clubs in Toronto's Queen Street West, including The Rivoli. Their 1986 debut album, produced by Canadian producer Peter Moore, was the blues-inspired Whites Off Earth Now!!, recorded using an ambisonic microphone in the family garage.\nThe group's fame spread with their second album, The Trinity Session, recorded in 1987 at Toronto's Church of the Holy Trinity. Their sound, again using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of blues, country, folk, rock and jazz earned them both critical attention and a cult following. The Los Angeles Times named the recording as one of the ten best albums of 1988.\n\n\nCountry: Canada\nGenre:Americana, alt-country, country rock, folk rock, blues rock, psychedelic rock, Indie rock\nQuality: 320 kbps\nAlbum List:\n\nCompilation Albums\n(1999) Cowboy Junkies - Rarities, B-Sides and Slow, Sad Waltzes\n(2001) Cowboy Junkies - Best Of Cowboy Junkies\n(2003) Cowboy Junkies - Platinum Gold Collection\n\nLive Albums\n(1995) Cowboy Junkies - 200 More Miles, Live Performances 1985Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1994\n(2000) Cowboy Junkies - Waltz Across America\n(2002) Cowboy Junkies - Open Road\n(2003) Cowboy Junkies - In the Time Before Llamas\n(2009) Cowboy Junkies - Acoustic Junk (limited edition)\n\nStudio Albums\n(1986) Cowboy Junkies - Whites Off Earth Now!\n(1988) Cowboy Junkies - The Trinity Sessions 1988\n(1990) Cowboy Junkies - The Caution Horses\n(1992) Cowboy Junkies - Black Eyed Man\n(1993) Cowboy Junkies - Pale Sun, Crescent Moon\n(1996) Cowboy Junkies - Lay It Down\n(1998) Cowboy Junkies - Miles from Our Home\n(2001) Cowboy Junkies - Open\n(2004) Cowboy Junkies - One Soul Now\n(2005) Cowboy Junkies - Early 21st Century Blues\n(2007) Cowboy Junkies - At The End Of Paths Taken \n(2010) Cowboy Junkies - Nomad Series, Vol.1 Renmin Park\n(2011) Cowboy Junkies - Nomad Series, Vol.2 Demons\n(2011) Cowboy Junkies - Nomad Series, Vol.3 Sing in My Meadow\n(2012) Cowboy Junkies - Nomad Series, Vol.4 The Wilderness\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08a785a1dbbdbb34edc1f83eda6946e74e58a068","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+%5B+15+Studio+Albums%2B3+Compilation+Albums%2B5+Live+Al","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08a785a1dbbdbb34edc1f83eda6946e74e58a068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,167,133,161,219,189,187,52,237,193,248,62,218,105,70,231,78,88,160,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
