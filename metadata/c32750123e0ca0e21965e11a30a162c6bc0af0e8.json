It provides the complete platform for controlling Audio Plug-Ins, delivering customization, while increasing performance and reliability. \n\nAGENT has been in development for two years and was conceived to address some of what we see as fundamental weaknesses that have evolved in workflow in the digital domain. Probably the most important weakness we saw in the plugin market was the inability to associate a hardware controller with more than 1 plugin at a time. We solve this problem by creating a virtual control surface with all your plugins already loaded into it. Now you can simply associate AGENT to your hardware controller and you have the ability to map 16 plugins simultaneously to your controller. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTEAM HEXWARS NOTES:\nAs already pointed out by our friends from R2R, \nonly an online installer is available for this plug-in. \nThis is plain dumb and will make many customers think \ntwice before buying it, but even more dumb since \nan offline authorization option is available! \n\nWTF? I can authorize it offline, but I must be online \nto install it? Does it makes any sense to you? \n\nAnother thing: \nIs using JuceRSA (known to be slow as hell) \nto encrypt 2000+ bytes of license really needed? \nJust hash the machine parameters before encryption, \ndon't encrypt them all in plain text wasting \ntons of cpu at startup to decrypt license!\n\nOur release include all files needed to run. \nJust install, authorize and enjoy! \n\nBringing you the real shit, without the hassles... \nonce again!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGREETZ!\nALL PRESENT, PAST &amp; FUTURE TEAMS AND iNDs\nWHO MADE AUDiO WAREZ HiSTORY\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT GOOD DEVS WHO DON'T TORTURE USERS\nWiTH SHiTTY PROTECTiONS AND BUY WHAT YOU USE AND LiKE!\n\nNFO v.1.1b - 09.2014\n- C0ME T0 THE DARK SiDE -\n- HEXWARS -\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtscene.cc\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (09)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32750123e0ca0e21965e11a30a162c6bc0af0e8","amp;dn":"NYRV+Systems+-+Agent+v1.2.0.3+OS+X+%5BHEXWARS%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32750123e0ca0e21965e11a30a162c6bc0af0e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,39,80,18,62,12,160,226,25,101,225,26,48,161,98,198,188,10,240,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
