Learn about 3D navigation and wireframing; surface, solid, and mesh modeling techniques; designing and assigning materials; placing natural and artificial lights; and configuring both direct and global illumination rendering parameters to create photorealistic renderings. With the 3D techniques from this course, you can prepare to bring your designs one step closer to reality.\nTopics include:\n\n    3D views, perspectives, and tools in AutoCAD\n    Controlling the visual style\n    Working with tiled viewports\n    Composing perspective views\n    Drawing in 3D\n    Modeling an Ionic column\n    Documenting 3D models\n    Creating dynamic slideshows, animations, and renderings\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:166647130323456f661ef947aedca7be4c606a93","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Up+and+Running+with+3D+in+AutoCAD+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"166647130323456f661ef947aedca7be4c606a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,102,71,19,3,35,69,111,102,30,249,71,174,220,167,190,76,96,106,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
