People are scared, angry, and hostile.&quot; Pretty tough stuff, but Chomsky does offer one ray of hope: &quot;If you want to change something, change the substance, not the shadow.&quot;\n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War. He is the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the ''most cited living author''. Chomsky is also the author of over 150 books.\n\n\nRunning Time: 55:09\n\n\n1.  Intro\n2.  Profits Before People\n3.  Culture Of Solidarity\n4.  Praise For Our Magnificence\n5.
