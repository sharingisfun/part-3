We'll start off by discussing how to set up our scene in 3ds Max that will help us work more effectively while creating our low polygon character. Then we'll jump right into modeling the torso and continue building the base body, all the while paying close attention to our polygon count limit. Once the base body is complete, we'll begin modeling the armor pieces for our character. Finally, once everything is complete, we'll learn optimization techniques and make any final modifications to the model.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd99de28bc70e2e44617b2f8e3a4cf94245231d3","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Modeling+Low+Polygon+Game+Characters+in+3ds+Max","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd99de28bc70e2e44617b2f8e3a4cf94245231d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,153,222,40,188,112,226,228,70,23,178,248,227,164,207,148,36,82,49,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
