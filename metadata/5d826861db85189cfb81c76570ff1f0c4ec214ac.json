It wasn't just their crushingly loud interpretation of the blues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it was how they incorporated mythology, mysticism, and a variety of other genres (most notably world music and British folk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ into their sound. Led Zeppelin had mystique. They rarely gave interviews, since the music press detested the band. Consequently, the only connection the audience had with the band was through the records and the concerts. More than any other band, Led Zeppelin established the concept of album-oriented rock, refusing to release popular songs from their albums as singles. In doing so, they established the dominant format for heavy metal, as well as the genre's actual sound.\n\n\n\n\nRequest by: justgoogleme, xxmohxx, TheRedState\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             NFO\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HNzpV.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HNzpV.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          DiSCOGRAPHY\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLed Zeppelin (1969)\nLed Zeppelin II (1969)\nLed Zeppelin III (1970)\nLed Zeppelin IV (1971)\nHouses Of The Holy (1973)\nPhysical Graffiti (1975)\nPresence (1976)\nIn Through The Out Door (1979)\nCoda (1982)\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            SETTiNGS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist: Led Zeppelin\nFormed: July, 1968 In England\nGenre: Rock\nYears Active: '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s, '00s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d826861db85189cfb81c76570ff1f0c4ec214ac","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+Discography+%28iTunes-Rip%29+%5BtheLEAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d826861db85189cfb81c76570ff1f0c4ec214ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,130,104,97,219,133,24,156,251,129,199,101,112,255,31,12,78,194,20,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
