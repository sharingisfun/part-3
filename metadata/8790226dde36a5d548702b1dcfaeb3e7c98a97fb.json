Released in August 1970 on Reprise Records, it was one of the four high-profile albums released by each member of folk rock collective Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in the wake of their chart-topping 1970 album DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  Vu. Gold Rush consisted mainly of country folk music, along with the rocking &quot;Southern Man&quot;. Songs were inspired by the Dean Stockwell-Herb Berman screenplay After the Gold Rush.\n\nAfter the Gold Rush peaked at number eight on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart; the two singles taken from the album, &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;When You Dance I Can Really Love&quot;, made it to number 33 and number 93 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100. Critics were not initially impressed with the album, though it has since been considered a masterpiece, and appears on a number of greatest albums lists.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:54\n    &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:45\n    &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:05\n    &quot;Southern Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:31\n    &quot;Till the Morning Comes&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:17\n    &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me&quot; (Don Gibson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n    &quot;Don't Let It Bring You Down&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:56\n    &quot;Birds&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:34\n    &quot;When You Dance I Can Really Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:05\n    &quot;I Believe in You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n    &quot;Cripple Creek Ferry&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:34\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Neil Young Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitar, piano, harmonica, vibes, lead vocals\n    Danny Whitten Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitar, vocals\n    Nils Lofgren Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitar, piano, vocals\n    Jack Nitzsche Ã¢â‚¬â€ piano\n    Billy Talbot Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass\n    Greg Reeves Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass\n    Ralph Molina Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums, vocals\n    Stephen Stills Ã¢â‚¬â€ vocals\n    Bill Peterson Ã¢â‚¬â€ flugelhorn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8790226dde36a5d548702b1dcfaeb3e7c98a97fb","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+After+The+Gold+Rush+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8790226dde36a5d548702b1dcfaeb3e7c98a97fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,144,34,109,222,54,165,213,72,112,43,29,207,174,179,231,201,138,151,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
