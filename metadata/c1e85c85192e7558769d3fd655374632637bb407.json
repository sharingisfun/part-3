Time has muted some of its daring, radical nature, elements of which were appropriated by practically every metal band (and most arena rock bands) that followed. Truth was almost as groundbreaking and influential a record as the first Beatles, Rolling Stones, or Who albums. Its attributes weren't all new -- Cream and Jimi Hendrix had been moving in similar directions -- but the combination was: the wailing, heart-stoppingly dramatic vocalizing by Rod Stewart, the thunderous rhythm section of Ron Wood's bass and Mickey Waller's drums, and Beck's blistering lead guitar, which sounds like his amp is turned up to 13 and ready to short out. Beck opens the proceedings in a strikingly bold manner, using his old Yardbirds hit &quot;Shapes of Things&quot; as a jumping-off point, deliberately rebuilding the song from the ground up so it sounds closer to Howlin' Wolf. There are lots of unexpected moments on this record: a bone-pounding version of Willie Dixon's &quot;You Shook Me&quot;; a version of Jerome Kern's &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; done as a slow electric blues; a brief plunge into folk territory with a solo acoustic guitar version of &quot;Greensleeves&quot; (which was intended as filler but audiences loved); the progressive blues of &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot;; the extended live &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot;; and &quot;I Ain't Superstitious,&quot; a blazing reworking of another Willie Dixon song. It was a triumph -- a number 15 album in America, astoundingly good for a band that had been utterly unknown in the U.S. just six months earlier -- and a very improbable success.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1e85c85192e7558769d3fd655374632637bb407","amp;dn":"Jeff+Beck+-+Truth+%282014%29+Warner+Music+Japan+WPCR+15588+FLAC+Beol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1e85c85192e7558769d3fd655374632637bb407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,232,92,133,25,46,117,88,118,157,63,214,85,55,70,50,99,123,180,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
