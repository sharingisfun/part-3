Oranges Band founder Daniel Black engineered and produced the record in the style of his heroes ? George Martin, Phil Spector, Jeff Lynn, and Quincy Jones ? with meticulous attention to detail and a willingness to make the recordings sound old. The result is one of those &quot;&quot;first record&quot;&quot; moments that blissfully wills its listeners into repeat listens. RIYL: Squeeze, The Shins, Weezer, Richie Valens.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98f96c336e855dc76dee31fad67bce1606bc514c","amp;dn":"Generationals+-+Con+Law+%5B2009%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98f96c336e855dc76dee31fad67bce1606bc514c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,249,108,51,110,133,93,199,109,238,49,250,214,123,206,22,6,188,81,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
