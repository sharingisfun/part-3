Based on the true story of one of the greatest moments in sports history, the tale captures a time and place where differences could be settled by games and a cold war could be put on ice. In 1980, the United States Ice Hockey team's coach, Herb Brooks(Kurt Russell), took a ragtag squad of college kids up against the legendary juggernaut from the Soviet Union at the Olympic Games. Despite the long odds, Team USA carried the pride of a nation yearning from a distraction from world events. With the world watching the team rose to the occasion, prompting broadcaster Al Michaels' now famous question, to the millions viewing at home: Do you believe in miracles? Yes! \n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nThe true story behind the greatest moment in sports history.   What America needed was a miracle. What it got was a hockey game.   Do you believe in miracles?   Believe.   Their game made them winners. Their spirit made them heroes.   If you believe in yourself, anything can happen. \n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players, XBox 360 &amp; PS3 compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
