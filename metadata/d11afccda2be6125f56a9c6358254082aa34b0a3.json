The pre-cinema period is closely examined to show those mass-cultural forms and practices - such as music hall and vaudeville - from within which cinema was to emerge. \n\nA perfect companion for any student of early cinema and film studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d11afccda2be6125f56a9c6358254082aa34b0a3","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Early+Cinema+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d11afccda2be6125f56a9c6358254082aa34b0a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,26,252,205,162,190,97,37,245,106,156,99,88,37,64,130,170,52,176,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
