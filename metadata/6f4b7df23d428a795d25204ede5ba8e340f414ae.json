Containing hit songs &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; and &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot;, the album went 4Ãƒâ€” platinum in the US, 2Ãƒâ€” platinum in the UK, and achieved high certifications around the world.\n\nNews of the World was the second album to be produced solely by the band (the first being A Day at the Races) and was recorded at Sarm West Studios and Wessex Studios, London and co-produced and engineered by Mike Stone.\n\nHaving received some criticism that their first completely self-produced project, A Day at the Races, was a &quot;boring&quot; album, Queen decided to shift their musical focus towards the mainstream but remain as the producers of the next album.\n\nAfter completing the A Day at the Races Tour, the quartet re-entered the studio to begin work on their sixth studio offering in July 1977, enlisting Mike Stone as assistant producer at the Basing Street and Wessex Studios in London. They scaled down their complex arrangements and focused on a &quot;rootsier&quot; sound (as Brian May put it). However the staple of the Queen sound, multitracked harmonies and guitar orchestrations, still exist on this album, albeit a bit more subtly. News of the World shows Queen's songwriting less dominated by May and Freddie Mercury, with Roger Taylor and John Deacon composing two songs each. The group completed recording and production of the album two months later in September and released the album on 28 October 1977.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;We Will Rock You&quot;   \tBrian May \t2:01\n02. \t&quot;We Are the Champions&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t2:59\n03. \t&quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t3:26\n04. \t&quot;All Dead, All Dead&quot;   \tMay \t3:10\n05. \t&quot;Spread Your Wings&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t4:34\n06. \t&quot;Fight from the Inside&quot;   \tTaylor \t3:03\n07. \t&quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot;   \tMercury \t3:51\n08. \t&quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot;   \tMay \t3:06\n09. \t&quot;Who Needs You&quot;   \tDeacon \t3:05\n10. \t&quot;It's Late&quot;   \tMay \t6:26\n11. \t&quot;My Melancholy Blues&quot;   \tMercury and Pixley \t3:29\n\n2011 Bonus EP\n\n01. \t&quot;Feelings Feelings (Take 10, July 1977)&quot;   \t1:54\n02. \t&quot;Spread Your Wings (BBC Session, October 1977)&quot;   \t5:25\n03. \t&quot;My Melancholy Blues (BBC Session, October 1977)&quot;   \t3:12\n04. \t&quot;Sheer Heart Attack (Live, February 1979)&quot;   \t3:34\n05. \t&quot;We Will Rock You (Fast) (Live, November 1982)&quot;   \t2:54","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f4b7df23d428a795d25204ede5ba8e340f414ae","amp;dn":"Queen+-+News+Of+The+World+%5Bwith+BONUS+EP%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f4b7df23d428a795d25204ede5ba8e340f414ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,75,125,242,61,66,138,121,93,37,32,78,222,91,168,227,64,244,20,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
