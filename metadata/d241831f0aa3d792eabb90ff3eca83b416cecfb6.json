Her texts are perceived by some critics to be obscene, irritating and full of biting derision and have succeeded in provoking strong reactions; one member of the Swedish Academy resigned after she was named a laureate.  Despite the controversy surrounding her work, Jelinek has won many distinguished awards in addition to the Nobel Prize, including the Georg BÃƒÂ¼chner Prize in 1998, the MÃƒÂ¼lheim Dramatists Prize in 2002 and 2004, and the Franz Kafka Prize in 2004.\n\nIn her writings, Jelinek rejects the conventions of traditional literary technique in favour of linguistic and thematic experimentation.  Her novels highlight gender oppression, and the power and aggression in contemporary human relationships.  In WOMEN AS LOVERS (1975), she describes the entrapment and victimization of women within a dehumanizing and patriarchal society.  The semi-autobiographical novel THE PIANO TEACHER (1983) addresses issues of sexual repression and was adapted for the screen in 2001.  The provocative novel LUST (1989) contains graphically-delineated descriptions of sexuality, aggression and abuse.  It received poor reviews by many critics, some of whom deemed it little more than pornography, but was considered misunderstood and undervalued by others, who noted the power of the cold descriptions of moral failures.\n\nIn 2012 a major premiere of SPORTS PLAY (1998), an exploration of the making, marketing and sale of the human body, brought her dramatic work to the attention of English-speaking audiences.\n\n\nAll the following books are in ePUB format, with three also in PDF as indicated:\n\n* GREED (Seven Stories, 2007).
