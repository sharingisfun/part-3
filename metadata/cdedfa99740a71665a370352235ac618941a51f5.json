Recognizing such black holes as &quot;playing the mystery card&quot; (e.g., arguing that science can tell us whether ghosts exist) will help readers identify and critique illogical arguments. One particularly interesting concept is the &quot;blunderbuss,&quot; which cites real but irrelevant illogical elements of, say, certain New Age beliefs. Another concept is what philosopher Daniel Dennett once called a &quot;deepity,&quot; which Law defines as &quot;saying something with two meanings&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one true but trivial, the other false but seemingly profound. Law shows how these and other verbal sleights of hand are used in a wide variety of belief systems, including the paranormal, homeopathy, Christian Science, and belief in UFOs. Law includes an entertaining appendix of fictional letters called, pace C.S. Lewis, the &quot;Tapescrew Letters,&quot; which recapitulate his eight logical black holes.\n\n\nDecoding Love : Why It Takes Twelve Frogs to Find a Prince, and Other Revelations from the Science of Attraction - Andrew Trees\n\nRelationships should be so simple. You meet someone. You fall in love. You live happily every after. This &quot;romantic story line&quot; has shaped our thinking about relationships for centuries. But the fairy tale is deeply flawed, and researchers today are making shocking discoveries about how and why we choose the people we love. \nDrawing from the latest studies in economics, brain science, game theory, evolutionary psychology, and other fields, Decoding Love takes on a topic we all think we understand-how we fall in love-and illustrates that most of our assumptions are wrong. Along the way, Andrew Trees offers surprising new insights into the nature of attraction and desire, as well as an intimate look at the strange intersection of romance and the modern world of dating.\n\n\nFortune's Formula : The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street - William Poundstone\n\nIn 1961, MIT mathematics professor Ed Thorp made a small Vegas fortune by &quot;counting cards&quot;; his 1962 bestseller, Beat the Dealer, made the phrase a household word. With Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, Thorp next conquered the roulette tables. In this prosaic but fascinating cultural history, Poundstone (How Would You Move Mt. Fuji?) tells not only what they did but how they did it. For roulette, Poundstone shows, Thorp and Shannon used a betting scheme invented by Shannon's Bell Labs colleague John Kelly, eventually applying Kelly's technique to investing, resulting in long-term records of extraordinary return with low risk. (Thorp revealed the secret in 1966's Beat the Market, but investors proved harder to persuade than blackjack players.) Many other characters figure into Poundstone's entertaining saga: a forgotten French mathematician, two Nobel PrizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“winning economists who declared war on the Kelly criterion, Rudy Giuliani, assorted mobsters, and winners and losers in all types of investing and gambling games. The subtitle is not a tease: the book explains and analyzes Kelly's system for turning small advantages into great wealth. The system works, but requires unusual amounts of patience, discipline and courage. The book is good fun for the rest of us.\n\n\nInnumeracy : Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences - John Allen Paulos\n\nThis is the book that made &quot;innumeracy&quot; a household word, at least in some households. Paulos admits that &quot;at least part of the motivation for any book is anger, and this book is no exception. I'm distressed by a society which depends so completely on mathematics and science and yet seems to indifferent to the innumeracy and scientific illiteracy of so many of its citizens.&quot;\nBut that is not all that drives him. The difference between our pretensions and reality is absurd and humorous, and the numerate can see this better than those who don't speak math. &quot;I think there's something of the divine in these feelings of our absurdity, and they should be cherished, not avoided.&quot;\n\n\nLogic of Life, The: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World - Tim Harford\n\nThe Logic of Life is the sequel to The Undercover Economist. Harford argues that rational behavior is more widespread than expected in the larger population. He uses economic principles to draw forth the rational elements of supposedly illogical behaviors to illustrate his point.\n\n\nMathematician Plays The Stock Market, A - John Allen Paulos\n\nWe like to think not only that mathematicians are smarter than the rest of us but that by dint of their mastery of numbers, they hold the key to understanding the baffling mysteries of the universe. Alas, Paulos (Innumeracy) says that's not always the case. As the author relates in this funny, insightful little volume about attempts to bring order and science to the free-for-all that is the stock market, he himself was once a big investor (in WorldCom). Despite strong evidence to sell, he desperately hung on to his stock as the price plummeted, proving that a head for numbers doesn't always translate to Wall Street know-how. Through most of this book, Paulos discusses various methods for predicting markets and offers thoughts on why people keep trying to perfect them. Shocking in their obtuseness are the so-called Elliot Wave followers, who believe stocks operate according to an impossibly arcane series of numerical waves and cycles. The efficient-market theorists-many of whom believe the stock market is so inherently efficient that everything one needs to know about a company is reflected in its stock price-get the most thorough joshing from Paulos: never able to resist a joke, he tells one about how many efficient market theorists it takes to change a light bulb. &quot;Answer: None. If the light bulb needed changing the market would have already done it.&quot; Playful and informative, Paulos's book will be appreciated by investors with a sense of humor.\n\n\nParanormality: Why we see what isn't there - Richard Wiseman\n\n&quot;People are emotionally drawn to the supernatural. They actively want weird, spooky things to be true ...Wiseman shows us a higher joy as he deftly skewers the paranormal charlatans, blows away the psychic fog and lets in the clear light of reason&quot;. (Richard Dawkins, Professor). Richard Wiseman is clear about one thing: paranormal phenomena don't exist. But in the same way that the science of space travel transforms our everyday lives, so research into telepathy, fortune-telling and out-of-body experiences produces remarkable insights into our brains, behaviour and beliefs. &quot;Paranormality&quot; embarks on a wild ghost chase into this new science of the supernatural and is packed with activities that allow you to experience the impossible. So throw away your crystals, ditch your lucky charms and cancel your subscription to &quot;Reincarnation Weekly&quot;. It is time to discover the real secrets of the paranormal. Learn how to control your dreams - and leave your body behind. Convince complete strangers that you know all about them. Unleash the power of your unconscious mind.\n\n\nPledge, The: A History of the Pledge of Allegiance - Jeffrey Meyer\n\nThe late producer, journalist, and teacher Jeffrey Jones partnered with former Life magazine news editor Peter Myer for this well-rounded view of the pledge of allegiance. Beginning with its 1892 composition by clergyman Francis Bellamy, the pledge is understood by Meyer and Jones as a product of unstable times, years shaken by Civil War, changing demographic makeup, and increasing economic disparities. Initially a prayer for &quot;intelligent patriotism,&quot; the pledge has worked both to unite and divide Americans, and it is this capricious nature that so interests Jones and Meyer-from its original celebratory use as a flag salute at a Columbus Day commemorative hosted by Youth's Companion magazine to its position as a tool to emphasize the principle separation of church and state to its usage as a bulwark against the presumed threat of communism under the Eisenhower administration. Myers and Jones effortlessly pull from their trade, an impressive array of newspapers, magazines and other literature-sewing together a book that succeeds admirably in portraying the pledge as a living oath capable of maturing with and reflecting the attitudes of an ever-evolving nation.\n\n\nUndercover Economist, The : Exposing Why the Rich Are Rich, the Poor Are Poor--and Why You Can Never Buy a Decent Used Car! - Tim Harford\n\nNattily packaged-the cover sports a Roy Lichtensteinesque image of an economist in Dick Tracy garb-and cleverly written, this book applies basic economic theory to such modern phenomena as Starbucks' pricing system and Microsoft's stock values. While the concepts explored are those encountered in Microeconomics 101, Harford gracefully explains abstruse ideas like pricing along the demand curve and game theory using real world examples without relying on graphs or jargon. The book addresses free market economic theory, but Harford is not a complete apologist for capitalism; he shows how companies from Amazon.com to Whole Foods to Starbucks have gouged consumers through guerrilla pricing techniques and explains the high rents in London (it has more to do with agriculture than one might think). Harford comes down soft on Chinese sweatshops, acknowledging &quot;conditions in factories are terrible,&quot; but &quot;sweatshops are better than the horrors that came before them, and a step on the road to something better.&quot; Perhaps, but Harford doesn't question whether communism or a capitalist-style industrial revolution are the only two choices available in modern economies. That aside, the book is unequaled in its accessibility and ability to show how free market economic forces affect readers' day-to-day.\n\n\nYou Can't Cheat an Honest Man: How Ponzi Schemes and Pyramid Frauds Work - James Walsh\n\nIn 1903 Charles Ponzi arrived in the USA with the aim of becoming as wealthy as Rockefeller. His modus operandi was based on the principle of robbing Peter to Pay Paul. \nThis book explores the mechanics, regulatory rules, legal issues, and sales variations surrounding &quot;multilevel&quot; marketing scams while offering advice on telling the difference between an investment and a fraudulent scheme.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdedfa99740a71665a370352235ac618941a51f5","amp;dn":"10+Ebooks+for+the+Cynical+-+Politics%2C+Economics++%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdedfa99740a71665a370352235ac618941a51f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,237,250,153,116,10,113,102,90,55,3,82,35,90,198,24,148,26,81,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
