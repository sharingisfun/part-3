He chose to live, Iyengar tells us, just as she has chosen not to let her blindness keep her from conducting prodigious research and intrepid experiments. Iyengar exponentially expands our understanding of the central role choice plays in the lives of animals and humans in a rapid-fire, many-faceted, and original inquiry that is at once personable and commanding. She explains our ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbiological need for choice and control,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the decision process, and the myriad influences that dictate everything from purchasing choices to career moves, voting, medical decisions, and marriage. The daughter of Sikh immigrants from India, Iyengar is particularly astute in her globally significant analysis of the striking differences between how Americans and Asians make decisions. Much of this eye-opening anatomy of choice focuses on consumerism, a lively, revealing arena, but IyengarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s high-voltage curiosity and penetrating insights are far more valuable when applied to deeper matters of existence. --Donna Seaman \n\nEvery day we make choices. Coke or Pepsi? Save or spend? Stay or go?\n\n\nWhether mundane or life-altering, these choices define us and shape our lives. Sheena Iyengar asks the difficult questions about how and why we choose: Is the desire for choice innate or bound by culture? Why do we sometimes choose against our best interests? How much control do we really have over what we choose? Sheena Iyengar's award-winning research reveals that the answers are surprising and profound. In our world of shifting political and cultural forces, technological revolution, and interconnected commerce, our decisions have far-reaching consequences. Use THE ART OF CHOOSING as your companion and guide for the many challenges ahead.\n\nHardcover: 352 pages \nPublisher: Twelve; 1 edition (March 1, 2010) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:202ee515adc465df38c3c23275c75cb86267059c","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Choosing++-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"202ee515adc465df38c3c23275c75cb86267059c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,46,229,21,173,196,101,223,56,195,194,50,117,199,92,184,98,103,5,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
