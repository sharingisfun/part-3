RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Securom + Serial\n1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Sports\n\n\nNOTE: Besides using the usual cheap Securom hack, SKIDROWs release crashes.\nFor instance when starting a match. We could point out that the crash is due\nto a broken data file (imgdt07.img). We could also point out that this file\nis also broken on a version of this game out on p2p. We could even point out\nthat the files are identical. But it seems a bit pointless when they get\naway with this week after week. The practice appears to be as systematic as\ntheir denial of it. And other groups and siteops implicitly accepts it.\nWe don't know if this says more about them, or the scene. Cheers!\n\n\nKick off for thrilling soccer matches on the pitch with PES 2013: Pro\nEvolution Soccer. Experience the excitement and heart-racing action of the\nworld's most popular sport on your PlayStation 3.
