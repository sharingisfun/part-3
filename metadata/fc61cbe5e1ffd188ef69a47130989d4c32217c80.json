In the course of the week, he flirts with a visiting movie star has a couple of encounters with a bored socialite, one of them in a prostitute&amp;#039;s bedroom, is shocked when Steiner, a &quot;serious&quot; writer and deep thinker kills himself and his entire family, and generally ignores his adoring girlfriend. In the end, he seems to have cut himself adrift on a sea of frivolity and self-disgust, with no real idea of how to find his way &quot;home&quot; again.\n\n-mp99","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc61cbe5e1ffd188ef69a47130989d4c32217c80","amp;dn":"La+Dolce+Vita%5B1961%5DDVDrip%5BEng+Subs%5D-Wurd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc61cbe5e1ffd188ef69a47130989d4c32217c80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,97,203,229,225,255,209,136,239,105,164,113,48,152,157,76,50,33,124,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
