B. Heimann, Hans D. Lehmann (Wiley-VCH, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nReflecting the progress in recent years, this book provides in-depth information on the preparation, chemistry, and engineering of bioceramic coatings for medical implants. It is authored by two renowned experts with over 30 years of experience in industry and academia, who know the potentials and pitfalls of the techniques concerned.\r\n\r\nFollowing an introduction to the principles of biocompatibility, they present the structures and properties of various bioceramics from alumina to zirconia to calcium phosphates. The main part of the work focuses on coating technologies, such as biomimetic deposition, sol-gel deposition, magnetron sputtering, and thermal spraying. Then follows a discussion of the major interactions of bioceramics with bone and connective tissue cells, complemented by an overview of the in-vitro testing methods of the biomineralization properties of bioceramics. The text is rounded off by chapters on the functionalization of bioceramic coatings and a look at future trends.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the authors bring together all aspects of the latest techniques for designing, depositing, testing, and implementing improved and novel bioceramic coating compositions, providing a full yet concise overview for beginners and professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c4f65571c5cb4c62ce58ed0c4bd60de73ef516","amp;dn":"Bioceramic+Coatings+for+Medical+Implants+-+Trends+and+Techniques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c4f65571c5cb4c62ce58ed0c4bd60de73ef516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,196,246,85,113,197,203,76,98,206,88,237,12,75,214,13,231,62,245,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
