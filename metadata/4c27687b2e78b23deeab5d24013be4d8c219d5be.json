He contends that while the contradictions have made capitalism flexible and resilient, they also contain the seeds of systemic catastrophe. Many of the contradictions are manageable, but some are fatal: the stress on endless compound growth, the necessity to exploit nature to its limits, and tendency toward universal alienation. Capitalism has always managed to extend the outer limits through &quot;spatial fixes,&quot; expanding the geography of the system to cover nations and people formerly outside of its range. Whether it can continue to expand is an open question, but Harvey thinks it unlikely in the medium term future: the limits cannot extend much further, and the recent financial crisis is a harbinger of this.\n\nDavid Harvey has long been recognized as one of the world's most acute critical analysts of the global capitalist system and the injustices that flow from it. In this book, he returns to the foundations of all of his work, dissecting and interrogating the fundamental illogic of our economic system, as well as giving us a look at how human societies are likely to evolve in a post-capitalist world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c27687b2e78b23deeab5d24013be4d8c219d5be","amp;dn":"Seventeen+Contradictions+and+the+End+of+Capitalism+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c27687b2e78b23deeab5d24013be4d8c219d5be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,39,104,123,46,120,178,61,238,171,93,36,1,59,228,216,194,25,213,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
