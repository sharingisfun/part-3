At age 3 or 4, he was taught to sing in church which led the way for him to sing in his junior high school's choir, which was a precursor to his musical career with the Gap Band and later his solo career.\nAccording to the Gap Band's website, he is sometimes colloquially known as &quot;Uncle Charlie&quot;. This name was given to him by rapper Snoop Dogg, with whom he is good friends.\nWilson has released multiple solo albums. 2000's Bridging the Gap produced the Top 40 R&amp;B hit &quot;Without You&quot;, and his most recent, Charlie Last Name: Wilson in fall 2005, with production from such hitmakers as R. Kelly, Kaygee and Tramp and The Platinum Brothers. Wilson also appeared on The Biggie Duets alongside R. Kelly on the song &quot;Mi Casa&quot;. He has worked with Snoop Dogg many times, such as on the single &quot;Beautiful&quot; (along with Pharrell), &quot;Signs&quot; (alongside Justin Timberlake) and &quot;Perfect&quot;, a song from Snoop's R&amp;G (Rhythm &amp; Gangsta) The Masterpiece.\n\nWilson has been nominated for one Grammy Award.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569e6c6a1bb6f8a6ae92f95d210c7e5a7163ffb4","amp;dn":"Charlie+Wilson-Uncle+Charlie-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569e6c6a1bb6f8a6ae92f95d210c7e5a7163ffb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,158,108,106,27,182,248,166,174,146,249,93,33,12,126,90,113,99,255,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
