It examines animal behaviour in all its infinite variety and in doing so we are allowed to witness some of the most enchanting animal personalities, as well as the most fearsome. \n\nLeaving parents, searching for food, building a home, finding a mate; each day brings a new test, a challenge for even the fittest and best adapted animal. Taking some three and a half years to make, David Attenborough travelled almost a quarter of a million miles to complete this fascinating and insightful documentary. \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19fa649e2ce5c3aa5835c965fed54d550ac1aff2","amp;dn":"The+Trials+of+Life++%28BBC+1990+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19fa649e2ce5c3aa5835c965fed54d550ac1aff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,250,100,158,44,229,195,170,88,53,201,101,254,213,77,85,10,193,175,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
