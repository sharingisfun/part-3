Set mainly in Kerala, India, in 1969, it is the story of Rahel and her twin brother Estha, who learn that their whole world can change in a single day, that love and life can be lost in a moment. Armed only with the invincible innocence of children, they seek to craft a childhood for themselves amid the wreckage that constitutes their family. Sweet and heartbreaking, ribald and profound, this is a novel to set beside those of Salman Rushdie and Gabriel Garcia Marquez","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22a23cad135e3a1c7693965fa852ebb730c86da3","amp;dn":"The+God+of+Small+Things+-+Arundhati+Roy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22a23cad135e3a1c7693965fa852ebb730c86da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,162,60,173,19,94,58,28,118,147,150,95,168,82,235,183,48,200,109,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
