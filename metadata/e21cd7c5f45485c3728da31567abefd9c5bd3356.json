Twenty-five or so outstanding writers have been asked by Zadie Smith to make up a fictional character. By any measure, creating character is at the heart of the fictional enterprise, and this book concentrates on writers who share a talent for making something recognizably human out of words (and, in the case of the graphic novelists, pictures). But the purpose of the book is variety: straight &quot;realism&quot;-if such a thing exists-is not the point. There are as many ways to create character as there are writers, and this anthology features a rich assortment of exceptional examples.\n\nThe writers featured in The Book of Other People include:\nAleksandar Hemon\nNick Hornby\nHari Kunzru\nToby Litt\nDavid Mitchell\nGeorge Saunders\nColm TÃƒÂ³ibÃƒÂ­n\nChris Ware, and more\n\nWhite Teeth: A Novel\nZadie SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dazzling debut caught critics grasping for comparisons and deciding on everyone from Charles Dickens to Salman Rushdie to John Irving and Martin Amis. But the truth is that Zadie SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is remarkably, fluently, and altogether wonderfully her own.\n\nAt the center of this invigorating novel are two unlikely friends, Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal. Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite match her name (Jamaican for Ã¢â‚¬Å“no problemÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). SamadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s late-in-life arranged marriage (he had to wait for his bride to be born), produces twin sons whose separate paths confound IqbalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every effort to direct them, and a renewed, if selective, submission to his Islamic faith. Set against LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s racial and cultural tapestry, venturing across the former empire and into the past as it barrels toward the future, White Teeth revels in the ecstatic hodgepodge of modern life, flirting with disaster, confounding expectations, and embracing the comedy of daily existence.\n\nNW: A Novel\nOne of the New York Times Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2012\n\nSet in northwest London, Zadie SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant tragicomic novel follows four localsÃ¢â‚¬â€Leah, Natalie, Felix, and NathanÃ¢â‚¬â€as they try to make adult lives outside of Caldwell, the council estate of their childhood. In private houses and public parks, at work and at play, these Londoners inhabit a complicated place, as beautiful as it is brutal, where the thoroughfares hide the back alleys and taking the high road can sometimes lead you to a dead end. Depicting the modern urban zoneÃ¢â‚¬â€familiar to city-dwellers everywhereÃ¢â‚¬â€NW is a quietly devastating novel of encounters, mercurial and vital, like the city itself.\n\nOn Beauty\nWinner of the 2006 Orange Prize for fiction and from the celebrated author of White Teeth comes another bestselling masterwork\n\nHaving hit bestseller lists from the New York Times to the San Francisco Chronicle, this wise, hilarious novel reminds us why Zadie Smith has rocketed to literary stardom. On Beauty is the story of an interracial family living in the university town of Wellington, Massachusetts, whose misadventures in the culture wars-on both sides of the Atlantic-serve to skewer everything from family life to political correctness to the combustive collision between the personal and the political. Full of dead-on wit and relentlessly funny, this tour de force confirms Zadie Smith's reputation as a major literary talent.\n\nNamed one of the Ten Best Books of the Year by the New York Times Book Review, Entertainment Weekly, Time, and Publishers Weekly A New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Denver Post, and Publishers Weekly bestseller A Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, Atlantic Monthly, Newsday, Christian Science Monitor, and Minneapolis Star Tribune Best Book of the Year Short-listed for the Man Booker Prize.\n\nChanging My Mind: Occasional Essays\n&quot;[These essays] reflect a lively, unselfconscious, rigorous, erudite, and earnestly open mind that's busy refining its view of life, literature, and a great deal in between.&quot;\n-Los Angeles Times \n\nSplit into five sections-Reading, Being, Seeing, Feeling, and Remembering--Changing My Mind finds Zadie Smith casting an acute eye over material both personal and cultural. This engaging collection of essays-some published here for the first time-reveals Smith as a passionate and precise essayist, equally at home in the world of great books and bad movies, family and philosophy, British comedians and Italian divas. Whether writing on Katherine Hepburn, Kafka, Anna Magnani, or Zora Neale Hurston, she brings deft care to the art of criticism with a style both sympathetic and insightful. Changing My Mind is journalism at its most expansive, intelligent, and funny-a gift to readers and writers both.\n\nThe Autograph Man\nAlex-Li Tandem sells autographs. His business is to hunt for names on paper, collect them, sell them, and occasionally fake themÃ¢â‚¬â€all to give the people what they want: a little piece of Fame. But what does Alex want? Only the return of his father, the end of religion, something for his headache, three different girls, infinite grace, and the rare autograph of forties movie actress Kitty Alexander. With fries.\n\nThe Autograph Man is a deeply funny existential tour around the hollow trappings of modernity: celebrity, cinema, and the ugly triumph of symbol over experience. It offers further proof that Zadie Smith is one of the most staggeringly talented writers of her generation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e21cd7c5f45485c3728da31567abefd9c5bd3356","amp;dn":"Zadie+Smith+Collection+%286+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e21cd7c5f45485c3728da31567abefd9c5bd3356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,28,215,197,244,84,133,195,114,141,163,21,103,171,239,217,197,189,51,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
