Within hours of the EU referendum result, the Prime Minister had resigned, the pound fell and Westminster was reeling. So how and why did this political revolution happen - and how does it stand to reshape Britain's politics?\r\n\r\nIn this film, the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg tells the inside story of how David Cameronâ€™s huge political gamble went wrong. Talking to the politicians and the people who ran the campaigns, she'll find out how a perfect storm brewed, which would end Cameronâ€™s premiership and throw the Labour Party into chaos, as well as reshaping Britain's place in the world for a generation.\r\n\r\nIn Sunderland - an area where the result sent Britain's political classes into shock - voters, politicians and activists will describe how the groundswell of protest grew. And Laura will explore how a gulf opened up between Westminster and large parts of modern Britain.\r\n\r\nJust weeks on from the referendum, British politics is already transformed: we have a new Prime Minister, Nigel Farage has bowed out, and Jeremy Corbyn's opponents within Labour have moved against him. But that is just the beginning: the effects of this result will be felt for decades.\r\n\r\nThis film tells the inside story of how it happened","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:319e9a6a41c6269ffbba9e77f57112fd13178962","amp;dn":"Brexit.The.Battle.For.Britain.EN.SUB.MPEG4.x264.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"319e9a6a41c6269ffbba9e77f57112fd13178962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,158,154,106,65,198,38,159,251,186,158,119,245,113,18,253,19,23,137,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
