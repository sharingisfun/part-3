Still flush from the mega-success of 1983Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœEliminator,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and its 1985 follow-up Ã¢â‚¬ËœAfterburner,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ someone decided to take the original recordings from the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s and remix them with added Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s-style percussion. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t long before every ZZ Top CD for sale came with the newly recorded mechanized drums that helped make Ã¢â‚¬ËœEliminatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ a hit. One thing Ã¢â‚¬ËœTres HombresÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need was robotic percussion.\n\nThe 10-disc Ã¢â‚¬ËœZZ Top: The Complete Studio Albums (1970-1990)Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ rights these quarter-century wrongs by reissuing the LPs in their original mixes. And if that means some of them Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like 1971Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœZZ TopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s First AlbumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sound a bit sludgy, and others Ã¢â‚¬â€ like 1975Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s part-live Ã¢â‚¬ËœFandango!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as crisp or as clear as you once thought, at least the heavily processed mixes that have plagued the records for years are no longer around.\n\nThat leaves you with the music itself. And, as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll quickly figure out as you plow through this hefty box, ZZ Top were a spotty band during their first 20 years. The first two albums especially (Ã¢â‚¬ËœZZ TopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s First AlbumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and 1972Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœRio Grande MudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) are loose, hazy and scattered. The trio didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really find focus until their terrific third outing, 1973Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœTres Hombres,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which sounds big, full and powerful in the remastered version here. So do most of the immediate follow-ups to that breakthrough album.\n\nBy the time ZZ Top entered the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s, they were ready for a change. You can hear the seeds of it taking root on 1981Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœEl Loco,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ but 1983Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœEliminatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the record that turned the dust-covered boogie band from Texas into global pop stars. It still sounds like a monster today, charging forward with some of the eraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most inventive blend of synth-pop hooks and old-school rock. Ã¢â‚¬ËœAfterburnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœRecyclerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are more of the same, but without the initial knockout punch.\n\nThe set is aimed at collectors, with all 10 albums packaged in reproductions of their original sleeves (i.e. the ones that came in gatefolds include gatefolds). Several of the records received aural upgrades over the years restoring their original mixes, so the most devoted fans probably already own them. But this is the first time a handful of them have been available like this and the first time theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve all been gathered in one place. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Complete Studio AlbumsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the most definitive collection of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first 20 years. You just have to decide if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth purchasing again.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e61d0d437ba967e54fb76129924c06054642e305","amp;dn":"ZZ+Top+-+The+Complete+Studio+Albums+1970-1990+%282013%29+MP3%40320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e61d0d437ba967e54fb76129924c06054642e305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,29,13,67,123,169,103,229,79,183,97,41,146,76,6,5,70,66,227,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
