Craig's stunning artwork is matched by the haunting strories of his characters' lives. Set in a mythical Middle East, at once contemporary and timeless, Habibi is a parable about our relationship to the natural world, about the cultural divide between the First World and the Third World, and about the common heritage of Christianity and Islam. The magic of storytelling allows us to see the fragility embedded in cruelty, to understand how beauty can preserve us from destruction and how love can save us from loss of hope.\n\nNOTE: This is the official fixed release by Minutemen-DTs of his previous release of this book that had a few mixed pages, so if you have the previous version, you should grab this one over it.\n\n\nFor anyone who cares, here's my release thread, I'll be posting all of my torrents there:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcecff5ff88957afc1d9484b9b8ae961f3f17a5d","amp;dn":"Habibi+%282011%29+%28c2c%29+%28fixed%29+%28Minutemen-DTs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcecff5ff88957afc1d9484b9b8ae961f3f17a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,236,255,95,248,137,87,175,193,217,72,75,155,138,233,97,243,241,122,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
