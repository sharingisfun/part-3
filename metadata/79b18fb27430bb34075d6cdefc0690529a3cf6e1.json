Cubase SX3 supports Windows XP and Mac OSX  \n    and  works  with a  multitude  of audio  interfaces.  Add to  that  the  \n    seamless integration of  external audio and  MIDI hardware, and  Cubase  \n    SX3 redefines music production technology.  \n              \n              \n    Top-10 new features of Cubase SX3  \n              \n              \n    Audio Warp: Realtime Time Stretching and Pitch Shifting offer extensive  \n    new audio  editing and  processing capabilities,  including ACID&amp;laquo;  File  \n    support: loops automatically adopt  a project's tempo; audio  files can  \n    follow tempo changes in realtime.  \n              \n              \n    Intuitive Play Order Track for pattern-based arranging adds a new level  \n    of creative music editing. Divide your song into sections, and then  re  \n    -arrange it on the fly.  Compare alternative versions of your  song and  \n    then convert them back into a linear form for mixdown and mastering.  \n              \n              \n    New Inplace Editor supports  ultra-fast direct MIDI event  editing from  \n    within the  project page.  Edit MIDI  events in  context with  audio or  \n    video.    \n              \n              \n    New MIDI Device  Maps / Panels  support direct access  to external MIDI  \n    hardware with user-definable graphic  editing panels. Import VST  Mixer  \n    Maps or create your own editing panels, even for the Track Inspector or  \n    the mixer's channel strip.  \n              \n              \n    User-definable  Workspaces  (window   layouts)  help  organizing   your  \n    desktop. Create  and save  a separate  workspace for  each step  of the  \n    production process.  Switch Workspaces  on the  fly, as  if working  on  \n    multiple computers or monitors.  \n              \n              \n    Studio  Connections  &quot;Total Recall&quot;  support  (optional integration  of  \n    Yamaha's Studio  Manager 2).  The first  step into  a new  dimension of  \n    software/hardware  integration. This  modular editing  system builds  a  \n    powerful  bridge between  the virtual  and physical  studio. Opening  a  \n    project can recall an entire studio setup within seconds.  \n              \n              \n    External FX Plugins allow  for direct integration of  external hardware  \n    effects processors into the VST audio mixer. Use your favorite outboard  \n    gear just like plugins - including automatic delay compensation.  \n              \n              \n    Extended Freeze function for virtual instruments and audio tracks  with  \n    added flexibility and improved performance. Freeze virtual  instruments  \n    with  or  without  insert   effects.  Then  automatically  unload   the  \n    instrument to free up RAM.  Freeze audio tracks with insert  effects to  \n    free up even more CPU performance.  \n              \n              \n    New part-based  Volume Envelopes  for direct  control of  dynamics. Fix  \n    level problems on the fly without wasting automation tracks. Then  move  \n    events with their volume envelopes.  \n              \n              \n    User-definable Color Coding for tracks and VST mixer channels  provides  \n    more clarity and better orientation - especially in complex projects.  \n              \n              \n    more info available at:  \n              \n    http://www.steinberg.de/Steinberg/defaultb0e4.htm \n\n      \n   \n                 ??                                   ?     ?\n                 ?? ???????? ??????????????????????? ??    ??    \n                 ?? ??    ?? ???????   ??   ???????? ??    ??    \n     ? ???????????????    ?????????    ??   ??    ??????????????????????? ?\n                                       ?\n\n    1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe  \n    2) Enjoy!!                  \n  \n   \n                   ???????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????\n                   ??    ?? ??    ??    ??   ??????  ???????\n     ? ??????????????    ??????????     ??   ???????????????????????????? ?\n                                        ?\n   \n                                  Special Note :  \n             \n                        H2O/DELiRiUM on Rampage.........!!!  \n             \n             \n     We couldn't let this one pass us by. It gave us the opportunity to  \n     improve on the Emu by  adding lots of new applications.  This time  \n     it  was  alot quicker.  Although the  prior release  took a lot of  \n     man-hours (1500), this wasn't  due to the copy  protection itself,  \n     but merely writing the emu on driver level (try to figure out  the  \n     driver model from microcrap...dooh).....  \n             \n     We hope u enjoy this release and the motto &quot; TRY BEFORE BUY (tm) &quot;   \n     still counts!!  \n             \n     PS1:  \n             \n     Note to Steinberg/End-Users:  \n             \n     It seems  that our  prior Release  Note stirred  something in  the  \n     Audio  Community (Yes,  we can  read). To  get some  of the  facts  \n     straight  we're  going  to  reveal  some  secrets  about  the copy  \n     protection itself,  and why  we  stated  that it  severely impacts  \n     performance.   \n             \n     Info from Syncrosoft website:  \n             \n     [QUOTE]  &quot;Syncrosoft's  protection  solution  is  different   from  \n     mainstream  software copy  protection methods.  It is  based on  a  \n     secure   executer,  the   eLicenser,  and   the  patented   MCFACT  \n     technology&quot; &quot;At  runtime, the  transformed program  code does  not  \n     reveal its semantics.  The eLicenser's crypto-services  are called  \n     from  time  to  time   by  the  transformed  program   code.&quot;  The  \n     transformed program code is represented as tables in the computers  \n     memory. An adversary can not reverse-engineer or debug the tables,  \n     because  a  reverse  transformation from  the  tables  to original  \n     program code is not feasible.  If the tables are manipulated,  the  \n     transformed program code will  crash or produce invalid  results.&quot;  \n     [ENDQUOTE]  \n             \n     So its not crackable?...  \n             \n     Now here is the explanation for what really goes on:  \n             \n     Transformation is  based on  replacing ordinary  machine code into  \n     tables representing results from calculations  \n             \n     Example:   \n             \n     Adding 2 numbers Normal machine-code would look something like :  \n             \n     Add eax, ebx  \n             \n     This will take 1 CPU cycle to execute.   \n             \n             \n     Now comes MCFACT :  \n             \n     1) Transform the first number into a table  \n             \n     2) Transform the second number into a table  \n             \n     3) Do allot of manipulation of these tables  \n             \n     4) More manipulation  \n             \n     5) Transform the Tables back to the numbers   \n             \n     6) Add the 2 numbers  \n             \n     This entire piece  takes up hundreds  of machine code  lines and a  \n     lot  of  loops  inside  this  code...estimated  CPU-cycles &lt;insert  \n     number greater than 1 here&gt;    \n             \n     No performance loss? We don't think so..........  \n             \n     And this code runs all the time!!......The dongle in fact is  only  \n     called 1 out of 10 times inside these scripts.........  \n             \n     A good example is the  protection build in the midi-part.  This is  \n     entirely wrapped in the script-crap.  Try moving a note and  swirl  \n     it around.....you should notice a sluggishness in the movement.  \n             \n     In fact u will notice an  improvement in version 3.1 prior to  the  \n     3.0 release.  This is  not due  to improvements  made by Steinberg  \n     (the  midi-engine  is still  the  same) but  improvements  made by  \n     Syncrosoft! (They optimized the script engine)!!!!!!!  \n             \n     To give the end user some peace of mind: the scripts aren't  built  \n     into the real-time audio-engine.....this is impossible because  of  \n     the performance loss u would have from the MCFACT.  \n             \n     PS2:  \n             \n     For those  of you  who where  observant, you  should have seen the  \n     blinking red light  on the tray  icon dongle when  dongle activity  \n     was present. We now added a nice new feature to the tray icon: The  \n     ToolTip will show how often the dongle is called during a session.  \n             \n     PS3:  \n             \n     Currently  the  emu  doesn't support  Cubase SX 1,  the effort  to  \n     support  this  one  is  too  high.  Besides  the  older  emus from  \n     ARCTIC/ZONE work perfect.For more info check the Readme on the Emu  \n             \n     PS4:  \n             \n     For all  the lame  crackers out  there who  try to  remove the H2O  \n     splash  or the dongle tray icon  : give respect to the effort  and  \n     don't do that,perhaps u could be in for a surprise who knows ...:)  \n              \n     End-users: If you don't have the H2O-splash and trayicon...do  not  \n     complain that  the application  in time  will crash  and you  will  \n     never know why it does.   \n   \n             \n     ? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?\n                                                      [NFO_BY_TH4IB0YZ_2005]\n                           \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79b18fb27430bb34075d6cdefc0690529a3cf6e1","amp;dn":"Steinberg.Cubase.SX.v3.1.1.944-H2O+%2B+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79b18fb27430bb34075d6cdefc0690529a3cf6e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,177,143,178,116,48,187,52,7,93,108,222,252,6,144,82,154,60,246,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
