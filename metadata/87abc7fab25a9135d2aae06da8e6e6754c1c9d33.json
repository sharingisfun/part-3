Presented in Disney Digital 3DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, \nWalt Disney PicturesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTRON: LegacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ hits U.S. theaters on December 17, 2010, \nin Disney Digital 3DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ and IMAXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 3D.\n\nHaving grown up with admiration of DisneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s groundbreaking original 1982 film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTRON,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Daft Punk \ntook on the scoring of the next chapter of the story with extraordinary thought and precision. \nThe duo assembled a symphony of one hundred world class musicians in London and recorded the \norchestra at AIR Lyndhurst Studios, BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s premier scoring facility.\n\nFrom Daft PunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first single release in 1993, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter were \nhailed as a new breed of electronic music innovators. Following their seminal debut in 1997 (Homework), \nthe band went on to release two more studio albums (Discovery-2001, Human After All-2005) and two live \nalbums (Alive 1997, Alive 2007), winning them both critical and popular acclaim throughout the world. \nDaft Punk are known as much for their music and technical innovation as their groundbreaking and elaborate \nvisual universe, which centers around their irrepressible and mysterious Robot personas. In 2006, their \ndirectorial art house film debut, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDaft PunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Electroma,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and in 2007 \nthey toured internationally with a jaw-dropping live show that was an awe-inspiring combination of their musical \nand visual prowess. Their collaboration with Kanye West on his #1 hit single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStrongerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was hailed as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Song \nof the YearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by SPIN Magazine (January 2008 issue), which also saw Daft sharing the cover with Kanye, having been \nawarded ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTour of the YearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by the magazine. Daft Punk performed with West on the Grammy Awards in 2008, marking \nthe mercurial duoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first and only television appearance anywhere in the world. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTRON: LegacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will mark Daft PunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nfirst film score.\n\nFrom the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s liner notes, director Joseph Kosinski commented on his first meeting with Daft Punk in November of \n2007: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI sat down not knowing what to expect, and I was immediately struck by their deep knowledge and love of film \nand particularly the sanctity in which they held Steven LisbergerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s TRON. It quickly became clear to me that this had \nthe potential to be an exciting collaboration. With topics that ranged from Bernard Hermann to Wendy Carlos, the \ndiscussion revealed a shared desire to create a score that blended classic orchestral themes with an electronic \nminimalism in a way that had never been done before. The result has truly exceeded my high expectations. Because the \nscore was developed in parallel with the production of the film, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had the opportunity to live with it for over a \nyear now and it never fails to thrill and inspire me as we near the finish line.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTRON: LegacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a 3D high-tech adventure set in a digital world thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unlike anything ever captured on the big screen. \nSam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), a rebellious 27-year-old, is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his father Kevin Flynn \n(OscarÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®- and Golden GlobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-winner Jeff Bridges), a man once known as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading video-game developer. When Sam \ninvestigates a strange signal sent from the old FlynnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ArcadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a signal that could only come from his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he finds himself \npulled into a digital world where Kevin has been trapped for 20 years. With the help of the fearless warrior Quorra \n(Olivia Wilde), father and son embark on a life-and-death journey across a visually-stunning cyber universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a universe \ncreated by Kevin himself that has become far more advanced with never-before-imagined vehicles, weapons, landscapes and a \nruthless villain who will stop at nothing to prevent their escape.
