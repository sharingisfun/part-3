The book serves as a beginner rendering manual and reference guide to further develop rendering skills. With an emphasis on step-by-step process, SketchUp users learn a universal approach to rendering varied SketchUp projects, including architecture, interiors, and site design models.\n\nThe book focuses on tasks and principles at the core of photorealistic rendering, including:\n============================================================================================\n\nRendering process: \n==================\n\nLearn a step-by-step process focused on workflow within SketchUp's familiar workspace.\n\nUniversal method: \n=================\n\nUnderstand how the process can be used to work with a variety of different integrated rendering programs, including Shaderlight, SU Podium and Twilight Render. These programs are easy to learn and function in SketchUp.\n\nTextures and materials: \n=======================\n\nDiscover how to obtain, apply and edit texture images representing surfaces.\n\nComponent details: \n==================\n\nLearn how to acquire and organize model details to allow for rich, expressive settings while maintaining computer and SketchUp performance.\n\nExterior and simulated lighting: \n================================\n\nLearn to set exterior lighting with the SketchUp's Shadow menu or illuminate a scene with simulated lights, lamps, and bulbs.\n\nRender settings: \n================\n\nUse specific settings for various rendering programs to quickly set texture character, image quality, and graphic output.\n\nComputer specifications: \n========================\n\nFind out how computers produce renders and the type of computer hardware required to streamline the process.\n\nPhotoshop post-processing: \n==========================\n\nLearn how to further refine rendered images in Photoshop.\n\n\nAuthor: Daniel Tal\nTitle: Rendering in Sketchup: From Modeling to Presentation for Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Interior Design\nPublisher: Wiley\nYear: 2013\nPages: 640\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\n-nelly- home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!\n\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor re-seed requests, help, support or anything else relating to The Pirate Bay.
