With both screaming banshee and traditional vocals set against a backdrop of controlled chaos, what ANAAL NATHRAKH manifests is plainly frightening. Their winding history includes not only the release of seven albums and an EP to rapturous acclaim, but collaborations with such iconic figures as Attila Csihar (Mayhem), Shane Embury and Danny Herrera (Napalm Death), Nick Barker (Testament, Dimmu Borgir), Joe Horvath (Circle Of Dead Children), Sethlans Teitan (Watain) and more.\n\nThis, alongside appearing on BBC Radio 1 at the personal behest of sadly missed legend John Peel, headlining a stage at the renowned cult Inferno Festival in Norway as their debut international live appearance, countless rankings among Ã¢â‚¬Å“best album of the yearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ polls and Ã¢â‚¬Å“album of the monthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the press and cover appearances on leading magazines such as Terrorizer, ANAAL NATHRAKH's status as one of the leading lights in extreme metal is undeniable.\n\nUniquely hallmarked by breathtaking musical ferocity, inventiveness and breadth, married with mercurial, intensely misanthropic and sharp intelligence, ANAAL NATHRAKH's sound is imbued with a palpable sense of menace that is virtually unmatched in metal. This year ANAAL NATHRAKH are set to reach ever higher on their mission to send the Earth crashing into the Sun.\n\nAnaal Nathrakh, which signed to Metal Blade earlier this Summer, has issued the following announcement about an upcoming album release:\n\n&quot;Finally, we are reaching the stage where things are coming together for the impending release of our new cacophony.\n\n&quot;For now, we can divulge that the title will be Desideratum. Everything is in Metal Blade's hands ready for pressing, artwork is finalized, and the release date is penciled [Oct 24th 2014].\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nIrrumator - Bass, Guitars, Programming\nV.I.T.R.I.O.L. - Vocals\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nThe Codex Necro (2001)\nDomine Non Es Dignus (2004)\nEschaton (2006)\nHell Is Empty, And All The Devils Are Here (2007)\nIn The Constellation Of The Black Widow (2009)\nPassion (2011)\nVanitas (2012)\nDesideratum (2014)\n\n\n\nDesideratum (2014)\n\n\n\n01.
