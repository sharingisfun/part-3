Increased coverage of agile methods and software reuse, along with coverage of 'traditional' plan-driven software engineering, gives readers the most up-to-date view of the field currently available. Practical case studies, a full set of easy-to-access supplements, and extensive web resources make teaching the course easier than ever.\n\nThe book is now structured into four parts:\n\n1: Introduction to Software Engineering\n2: Dependability and Security\n3: Advanced Software Engineering\n4: Software Engineering Management","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7058694560e18aa6910bee805094eb438d989c78","amp;dn":"Software_Engineering+9th-+Ed+By+Ian+Sommerville","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7058694560e18aa6910bee805094eb438d989c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,88,105,69,96,225,138,166,145,11,238,128,80,148,235,67,141,152,156,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
