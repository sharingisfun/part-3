Pioneered by Gary Becker, this approach asserts that all actions, whether working, playing, dating, or mating, have economic motivations and consequences, and can be analyzed using economic reasoning. Intended as an introduction to the current state of the field, the essays are informal and nontechnical, while still using up-to-date economic reasoning to illuminate such topics as crime, marriage, discrimination, immigration, fads and fashions.\n\n\nProduct Details:\nPaperback: 260 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (August 25, 1995)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521479495\nISBN-13: 978-0521479493\n\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b39320d61482589a1e92eedce88e635b0267dcc","amp;dn":"The+New+Economics+of+Human+Behaviour+by+Mariano+Tommasi+and+Kath","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b39320d61482589a1e92eedce88e635b0267dcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,57,50,13,97,72,37,137,161,233,46,237,206,136,230,53,176,38,125,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
