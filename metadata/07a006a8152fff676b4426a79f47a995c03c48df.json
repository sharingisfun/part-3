Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\nGuests: Brian Regan\n\nEpisode 232: TACS is back with the Hollywood ReporterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“best shows of all-timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ list, Ant gives a recap of last nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stupid and dull EmmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, talks about the PopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upcoming visit to NY, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“no drone zone,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and some mayhem that went down in three boroughs. Brian Regan joins the show to talk about his live comedy show, staying out of trouble, the appeal of troublemakers, smooth peanut butter, family issues, and comics in casinos. The guys then discuss being offensive, trying out new material, separating family from the stage, the joys of divorce, relationship drama, we learn all about the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“podia,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and they have some political and corn (WTF?) chat. They also talk about hecklers, getting in trouble on Twitter, we get some behind the scenes info from Brian, and hear about what is coming up next for him. We then see a pizza jacking rat, Ant breaks down de Blasio as a mayor, the homeless, the muzzy kid with the clock, shitting on culture, a raping militia commander, toothache issues in the Middle East, phony feminists, and burkas. Anthony takes a few calls and further discusses Muslim culture, we see a video of Madonna spanking Anderson Cooper, Ant admits heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clueless about 2015, he talks about Andy Samberg's ass eating joke, women loving animal love, retarded John Lennon, being offended on purpose, and Howard Stern being sensitive.\n\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07a006a8152fff676b4426a79f47a995c03c48df","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-09-21+Brian+Regan+MP4MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07a006a8152fff676b4426a79f47a995c03c48df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,160,6,168,21,47,255,103,107,68,38,167,159,71,169,149,192,60,72,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
