It provides\nfocused and detailed code examples that demonstrate the most\nimportant concepts, with commentary on how the\ncode examples work. This course also provides a\nsubstantial mathematical and theoretical\nbackground on the underlying cryptographic concepts\nAfter experimenting with the provided example\nprograms, the student should have a good\nunderstanding of the major cryptographic\nalgorithms and standard cryptographic programming\ntechniques. Readers should also gain a solid understanding of\nhow .NET security works and how to implement user-based and code\naccess security in their own .NET programs. Walk through the\nblack art of cryptography, including public/private and symmetric\nencryption, hashing, digital signatures, and a dash of salt\nReview the basics of cryptography and what techniques are\nappropriate for various\nsituations.
