This unique collaboration attempts to address this problem by bringing together a host of prominent scholars from across the sciences to offer new insights into predicting the future. They demonstrate that long-term trends and short-term incentives need to be understood in order to adopt effective policies, or even to comprehend where we currently stand and the sort of future that awaits us. Developing novel techniques to forecast global conditions, the authors tackle important questions such as: What does the future hold? How can we sustain prosperity? Are we likely to have less war and genocide? Are nuclear weapons destined to spread to unstable countries? What environmental scarcities and conflicts are we likely to face? Each chapter is built around cause and effect relationships based on empirical evidence that creates a unified predictive model of global economic and political conditions. The limits and possibilities of scientific prediction are also explored, as are the physical, biological and social properties of the global system. This book will have a wide appeal among physical and social scientists interested in the linkages between scientific method and the prediction of future human behavior and global conditions.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 524 pages\nPublisher: Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd (29 Aug 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1783471867\nISBN-13: 978-1783471867\nAmazon Link: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Predicting-Future-Science-Economics-Politics/dp/1783471867\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40c2fe926db696c59f7a763e6697654db2708e19","amp;dn":"Predicting+the+Future+in+Science%2C+Economics+and+Politics+%282014%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40c2fe926db696c59f7a763e6697654db2708e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,194,254,146,109,182,150,197,159,122,118,62,102,151,101,77,178,112,142,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
