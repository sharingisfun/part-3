Lavishly illustrated with over sixty original artworks, All Yesterdays aims to challenge our notions of how prehistoric animals looked and behaved. As a critical exploration of palaeontological art, All Yesterdays asks questions about what is probable, what is possible, and what is commonly ignored. Written by palaeozoologist Darren Naish, and palaeontological artists John Conway and C.M. Kosemen, All Yesterdays is scientifically rigorous and artistically imaginative in its approach to fossils of the past - and those of the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc37bec13e899307376f8a8d5fc1ab4dd0539e55","amp;dn":"All+Yesterdays%3A+Unique+and+Speculative+Views+of+Dinosaurs+and+Ot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc37bec13e899307376f8a8d5fc1ab4dd0539e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,55,190,193,62,137,147,7,55,111,138,141,95,193,171,77,208,83,158,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
