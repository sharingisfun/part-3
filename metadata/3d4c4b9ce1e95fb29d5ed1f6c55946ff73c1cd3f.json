Calculus 10th and Calculus ETF 6th both have the same problem set as they both cover the exact same topics, only a little differently as the book titles suggest (problem numbering in each version is different for this reason). In the regular version of calculus, transcendental functions (LOG, EXP, ARC) are covered in a separate chapter *after* the derivative and integration concepts have been introduced. In the early transcendental functions (ETF) version, transcendental functions are treated along with regular functions as the derivative and integration concepts are being developed. Students in an engineering or physics program need the calculus handling of these special functions concurrently in some other courses of their semester curriculum, so they study them earlier than students in health or administrative sciences.\n\ncalculus = single-variable calculus + multi-variable calculus\n\n[on my soapbox]\n\nFull solutions manuals act like a poison: Too much of it, you die. In small doses, you get stronger.\n\nAlways attempt the solution to a problem by yourself (after appropriate study of the topics) while following the procedure recommended by your teach or TA (problem reading and comprehension, problem data, requested parameter(s), problem type identification, solution strategy, execution, validation, blah, blah, blah). Only once you have solved it to the best of your ability should you resort to &quot;the poison&quot;. Even when you get the correct answer to the problem you should take a look at the ISM... Sometimes you may get the correct answer, by chance, from a faulty application of a principle or from two self-cancelling algebra mistakes. Also you could learn (and master?) another (often shorter) path of solution to the correct answer, a sure way to enhance your performance in these beat the clock quizzes/exams. Most of the time ISMs are written in a cryptic manner (read: with several key steps missing) for instructors who (should) know their stuff, so if you don't know yours well enough at this point, ISM solutions will just look like a big load of gibberish and will get you more confused than without them. Always write down your own solutions with all the steps included (textbook solved examples reworked your way, practice problems, assignments, practice exams, etc). If you copy directly from the ISM for an assignment, your teach or TA will see you did as learners don't solve the way the experienced do. Acing assignments and flunking quizzes/exams is usually a sign of accute poisoning. ISMs are great learning tools but use them very wisely or they will make you fail. BIG time. (I write from experience... Casual reading of the ISM in the beer lounge of the frat house on the eve of an exam is taking the poison at maximum strength.)\n\n[off my soapbox]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d4c4b9ce1e95fb29d5ed1f6c55946ff73c1cd3f","amp;dn":"Calculus+Early+Transcendental+Functions+6th+Larson+solutions+ISM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d4c4b9ce1e95fb29d5ed1f6c55946ff73c1cd3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,76,75,156,225,233,95,178,157,94,209,246,197,89,70,255,115,193,205,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
