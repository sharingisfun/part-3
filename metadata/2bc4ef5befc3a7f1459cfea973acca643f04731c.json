Its place in synth folklore is assured and very well-deserved, but due to the small numbers produced and the desirability of the instrument the chances of finding one in good working order nowadays for less than a kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ransom is slim.\n\nThe Odyssey was seen as ARPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rival to the Minimoog but in truth there were sufficient differences between the two to negate this argument in these more enlightened times. Put simply, the Minimoog had three oscillators and the Odyssey had two Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Minimoog was monophonic and the Odyssesy was duophonic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Minimoog had no dedicated ring modulator while the Odyssey did. More immediately striking was that the Minimoog had knobs and the Odyssey had sliders. It also had a distinct operational architecture and because of this weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen some people spend up to an hour trying to get it to make a sound. For this reason we decided on the name Ã¢â‚¬ËœOddityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for our labour of love.\n\nThe Oddity takes all that was unique and great about this instrument and thanks to a painstaking emulative process brings these qualities into the modern age. Now you can finally have those famously aggressive, funky and searing Odyssey tones and exclusive ARP operational method combined with reliable tuning, non-breakable sliders and, something only dreamed about in the 1970Ã¢â‚¬Â²sÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.patch memories.\n\nKey Features\nAnalog modeling of the legendary ARP Odyssey.\nTwo Syncable oscillators.\nFully tuneable across a six octave range.\nMonophonic &amp; Duophonic modes.\nSawtooth, Square, Sine &amp; Variable pulse width waveforms.\nRing modulator.\nResonant 24dB/octave lowpass filter.\nHighpass filter.\nDynamic control over filter cutoff and amplitude.\nTimed Morphing between presets.\nFlying Slider feature.\nA=440Hz Reference tone.\nFull automation support.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/oddity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/oddity&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===========================================================================\n\n\nGForce Ã‚Â· Minimonsta v1.2.2 Ã‚Â· OS X Ã‚Â· AiR | 34 MB\n\n\nThe original Minimoog was manufactured between 1971 and 1982 and was an instant classic thanks to its musician friendly logical layout, tactile front panel, warm oscillators and powerful 24dB lowpass filter. In its time 13,000 were sold but if you want one now be prepared to pay handsomely.\n\nThe Minimonsta is an award winning, highly detailed and accurate emulation of this original instrument with heaps of attitude. We think of it as a Minimoog emulation on steroids because whereas, until the Minimonsta, numerous Minimoog clones simply attempted to copy the original instrument and then add one or two features such as polyphony and another LFO, the Minimonsta takes a radically different look at this vintage masterpiece and operates on two levels.\n\nMini\nFirstly, on the Mini level you have all the features and sounds of the Minimoog including accurate waveforms, a painstakingly accurate resonant filter, snappy ADS envelope generators and the wonderful Mini loop-feedback function. Using just these parameters, the Minimonsta has a huge tonal range from fat to fierce and from searing to sharp sizzles.\n\nHowever, there is also another dark side to the beast, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s here where you can unleash a full-on Monsta.\n\nMonsta\nIn short, think of the Minimonsta as a modular Minimoog but without all the clutter of patch cords.\n\nInstead of being shackled to a single LFO as per the original instrument, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to assign an LFO to almost any original Mini parameter including filter cutoff, resonance, individual oscillator volumes, even each envelope parameter. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, each LFO has several waveforms, sync, and delay options from which to choose.\n\nAdditionally, for every parameter to which you can apply an LFO, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also possible to apply an extra ADSR.\n\nFinally, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the ability to assign MIDI modulation to any original Mini parameter and create effects such as dynamic glide times or velocity response to filter (both positive and negative). Put simply, the scope for sound design and sonic creativity is limitless.\n\nKey Features\nAnalog modeling of the legendary Minimoog.\nAll original features including 3 oscillators and the famous Moog 4-pole, 24dB/octave filter\nAdditional LFO &amp; ADSR for modulation of almost every parameter.\nVast MIDI control possibilities.\nMonophonic, polyphonic, legato and unison trigger modes.\nFully programmable with over 6000 factory patches (including many from Rick Wakeman).\nReal-time morphing between up to twelve patches via keyboard control.\nExternal input allows filter to be used as plug-in effect.\nDelay effect.\nFull automation support.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/minimonsta&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/minimonsta&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nfuture-dada.com  MMXIII.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc4ef5befc3a7f1459cfea973acca643f04731c","amp;dn":"GForce+-+Oddity+%2B+Minimonsta+-+64bit+-+OS+X+-packet-dada","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bc4ef5befc3a7f1459cfea973acca643f04731c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,196,239,91,239,195,167,241,69,156,254,169,115,172,202,100,63,4,115,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
