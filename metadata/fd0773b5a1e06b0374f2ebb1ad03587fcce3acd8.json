Success came immediately; this sparkling half-hour, cut live in the\nstudio in April 1956, iced the cake.\nJazz hounds often dismiss Prima as just an Italanate Louis Armstrong\nimpersonator, perhaps because of the three Satchmo hits here: &quot;You Rascal\nYou&quot;, and a medley joining a restrained &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot;, to a non-\nsoporific &quot;When It's Sleepy Time Down Youth&quot;. But that is to miss the point:\nthis is simply irrepressible music that more than matches its glorious cover\nshot. Prima is joyous, rumbustious, and irresistible, making even the band\nchuckle on &quot;Oh Marie&quot;, with Smith in contrast, a delightfully straight-laced foil.\nButera and pals, meanwhile, set them up with some of the fizziest jump-jive\never recorded. The sound has been imitated often, not least when Brian\nSetzer's cover of &quot;Jump, Jive, An' Wail&quot; helmed a GAP commercial. Butera,\nwhose arrangement it appropriated, grumbled that he was paid three pairs of\npants for the privilege.\nPrima dies in 1978, but his legacy lives on through daughter Lena, herself\nseen recently performing at the Sahara, and trough his later turn as a regal,\njive-talking orangutan in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. Truly, the man was the king of\nswingers.
