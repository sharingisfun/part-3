Along the way, world events familiar to readers, such as September 11th and Russiaâ€™s war in Georgia in 2008, as well as the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, are presented from never-before-seen perspectives.  \r\n\r\nThis book is a grand, staggering achievement and a breathtaking look at one manâ€™s rule. On one hand, Putinâ€™s many reformsâ€”from tax cuts to an expansion of property rightsâ€”have helped reshape the potential of millions of Russians whose only experience of democracy had been crime, poverty, and instability after the fall of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, Putin has ushered in a new authoritarianism, unyielding in his brutal repression of revolts and squashing of dissent. Still, he retains widespread support from the Russian public. \r\n\r\nThe New Tsar is a narrative tour de force, deeply researched, and utterly necessary for anyone fascinated by the formidable and ambitious Vladimir Putin, but also for those interested in the world and what a newly assertive Russia might mean for the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08cc108a71fad16c3ee163d80e864516749f19b","amp;dn":"Steven+Myers+-+The+New+Tsar%3AThe+Rise+and+Reign+of+Vladimir+Putin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08cc108a71fad16c3ee163d80e864516749f19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,140,193,8,167,31,173,22,195,238,22,61,128,232,100,81,103,73,241,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
