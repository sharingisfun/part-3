With a name easily applicable to either gender, young teenager Alex's (Ines Efron) hermaphroditic physiology causes a massive identity crisis and severe emotional withdrawal. The problems create social problems in the family's home of Argentina and virtually force Alex and his/her sympathetic parents, Kraken (Ricardo DarÃƒÂ­n) and Suli (Valeria Bertuchelli) to move to nearby Uruguay, at a point when Alex wrestles with the throes of puberty. The situation grows increasingly complex when several friends of the family arrive: marrieds Erika (Carolina Pelereti) and Ramiro (German Palacios), a plastic surgeon, and their adolescent son, Alvaro (Martin Piroyanski), whom Alex instantly propositions for sex. As Alex battles some local punks who try unsuccessfully to rape him/her (saved at the last minute by Kraken), Alvaro finally accepts Alex's promptings for intercourse and comes to a gradual realization of his own gayness. Meanwhile, the rift between the adults and the youth widens with increasing rapidity.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : XXY.2007.720p.BluRay.x264-KG.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 5 424 Kbps\nLength            : 3.44 GiB for 1h 30mn 46s 24ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 4 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 692 (1.850) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 576 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995829/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995829/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Spanish\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f190fea2f94eddda7aeea45f9350e8e444180b","amp;dn":"XXY.2007.720p.BluRay.x264-KG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f190fea2f94eddda7aeea45f9350e8e444180b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,241,144,254,162,249,78,221,218,122,238,164,95,147,80,232,228,68,24,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
