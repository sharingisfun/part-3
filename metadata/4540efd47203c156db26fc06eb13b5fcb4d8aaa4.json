They start from a single assertion: Leaders do whatever keeps them in power. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care about the Ã¢â‚¬Å“national interestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€or even their subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â€unless they have to.\nThis clever and accessible book shows that the difference between tyrants and democrats is just a convenient fiction. Governments do not differ in kind but only in the number of essential supporters, or backs that need scratching. The size of this group determines almost everything about politics: what leaders can get away with, and the quality of life or misery under them. The picture the authors paint is not pretty. But it just may be the truth, which is a good starting point for anyone seeking to improve human governance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4540efd47203c156db26fc06eb13b5fcb4d8aaa4","amp;dn":"The+Dictator%27s+Handbook+-+Why+Bad+Behavior+Is+Almost+Always+Good","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4540efd47203c156db26fc06eb13b5fcb4d8aaa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,64,239,212,114,3,193,86,219,38,252,6,235,19,181,252,180,216,170,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
