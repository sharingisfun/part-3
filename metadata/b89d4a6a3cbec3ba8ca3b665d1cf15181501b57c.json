The Duchy is a land of mountains and lakes, with a castle town and a still-functioning Roman aqueduct. The Royal Guard are the police of this nation but seem to behave more like an army than a police force. This country is the smallest member of the United Nations with the population of 3,500. It was the origin of the legendary counterfeit called the Goat Bills which caused convulsions in Europe for 400 years, including the Great Depression in 1929 in the United States. A group of assassins called the &quot;Shadows&quot; also works for the duke of the island.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b89d4a6a3cbec3ba8ca3b665d1cf15181501b57c","amp;dn":"Lupin+the+third++Movie+castle+of+cagliostro+english+dub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b89d4a6a3cbec3ba8ca3b665d1cf15181501b57c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,157,74,106,60,190,195,186,140,163,182,101,209,207,21,24,21,1,181,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
