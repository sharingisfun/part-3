In 2004, he recruited five Irish female musicians who had not previously performed together: vocalists ChloÃƒÂ« Agnew, Ãƒâ€œrla Fallon, Lisa Kelly and MÃƒÂ©av NÃƒÂ­ Mhaolchatha, and fiddler MÃƒÂ¡irÃƒÂ©ad Nesbitt, and shaped them into the first lineup of the group that he named Celtic Woman. Downes chose a repertoire that would range from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs.\n \nThe group's lineup has changed over the years; in 2009, the group consisted of ChloÃƒÂ« Agnew, Lynn Hilary, Lisa Kelly, Alex Sharpe and fiddler MÃƒÂ¡irÃƒÂ©ad Nesbitt; Alex Sharpe left the group in May 2010.Five albums have been released under the name &quot;Celtic Woman&quot;: Celtic Woman, Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration, Celtic Woman: A New Journey, Celtic Woman: The Greatest Journey, Celtic Woman: Songs from the Heartand Celtic Woman: Believe. The group has undertaken a number of world tours. Cumulatively, albums by Celtic Woman have sold over 6 million records worldwide\n \nThe foundation for Celtic music's popularity outside Ireland and Europe was built by tapping into the success of artists such as Enya and Clannad, along with stage shows Riverdance and Lord of the Dance. Celtic Woman has been described as being &quot;Riverdance for the voice.[IMG]http://i573.photobucket.com/albums/ss172/amandaCWlvr/Celtic%20Woman/3.jpg[/IMG][IMG]http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd398/trtk/CelticWomen.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0876ba226d87a1bc0a2647432acb723e84c4988","amp;dn":"Celtic+Woman+Discography+Plus+Solo+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0876ba226d87a1bc0a2647432acb723e84c4988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,135,107,162,38,216,122,27,192,162,100,116,50,172,183,35,232,76,73,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
