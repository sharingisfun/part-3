ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about the happenings between a young woman mayor and an elite bureaucrat. Jo Gook is an exceedingly smart government official. He passed the Higher Civil Service quickly, and basically is the perfect guy. But being a deputy mayor is not enough for him. He lives with the dream of becoming South KoreaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s President. He should have easily gone straight to the top, but due to an unexpected incident, he gets dispatched as a deputy mayor for a provincial small town, Inju City, where Shin Mi Rae was working. Shin Mi Rae is a low-ranking secretary in Inju, but she works her way up in becoming the youngest City Mayor. As their paths met, they have to deal with each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal and social differences.
