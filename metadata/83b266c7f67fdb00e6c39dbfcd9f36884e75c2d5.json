The great masters are well represented here, and the themes by Bach, Pachelbel, Vivaldi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Brahms, DvorÃƒÂ¡k, Tchaikovsky, and many others are among the most beloved melodies of all time. This program is certainly helpful to anyone trying to get acquainted with classical music, and quite easy to use for identifying names, though it really is just an introduction and the excerpts should encourage listeners to seek out the complete works. The performances are by soloists and orchestras from around the world, including a few with international reputations. While some listeners will use this album as a starting point for pursuing classical studies, others will enjoy it simply as pleasant background music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83b266c7f67fdb00e6c39dbfcd9f36884e75c2d5","amp;dn":"The+50+Most+Essential+Pieces+of+Classical+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83b266c7f67fdb00e6c39dbfcd9f36884e75c2d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,178,102,199,246,127,219,0,230,195,157,191,205,159,54,136,78,117,194,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
