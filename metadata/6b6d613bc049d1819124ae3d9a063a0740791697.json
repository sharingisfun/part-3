Experience a new omnibus simulator with OMSI 2 and start discovering Spandau while driving the omnibus. OMSI 2 is the successor of the well-known and awarded omnibus simulator &quot;OMSI - The Bus Simulator&quot;. OMSI 2 not only offers the routes and buses you already know from OMSI, but adds lots of exciting new features. In OMSI 2 you can drive the first ever articulated bus in the OMSI history, the MAN NG272. Explore the new omnibus line 5 covering a total distance of 12 km from the subway station Ruhleben to the psychiatric clinic Spandau. Thanks to the newly added chronology function youÂ´ll not only be able to drive through Spandau in 1986, but also to relive the changes taking place in Spandau between 1986 and 1994","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b6d613bc049d1819124ae3d9a063a0740791697","amp;dn":"OMSI+2+Incl+ALL+DLC+Update+03.10.2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b6d613bc049d1819124ae3d9a063a0740791697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,109,97,59,192,73,209,129,145,36,174,61,154,6,58,7,64,121,22,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
