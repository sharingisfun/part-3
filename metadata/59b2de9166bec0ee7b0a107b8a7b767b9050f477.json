Now Eragon must travel to Ellesmera, land of the elves, for further training in the skills of the Dragon Rider: magic and swordsmanship. Soon he is on the journey of a lifetime, his eyes open to awe-inspring new places and people, his days filled with fresh adventure. But chaos and betrayal plague him at every turn, and nothing is what it seems.

Since then, he's not only learned to create magic with words-he's been challenged to his very core. Following the colossal battle against the Empire's warriors on the Burning Plains, Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, have narrowly escaped with their lives. Still, there is more adventure at hand for the Rider and his dragon, as Eragon finds himself bound by a tangle of promises he may not be able to keep.\nFirst is Eragon's oath to his cousin, Roran: to help rescue Roran's beloved from King Galbatorix's clutches. But Eragon owes his loyalty to others, too. The Varden are in desperate need of his talents and strength-as are the elves and dwarves. When unrest claims the rebels and danger strikes from every corner, Eragon must make choices-choices that will take him across the Empire and beyond, choices that may lead to unimagined sacrifice.\nEragon is the greatest hope to rid the land of tyranny. Can this once simple farm boy unite the rebel forces and defeat the king?\n\nBook 4 - Inheritance (Inheritance Cycle) by Christopher Paolini (Oct 23, 2012)\nNot so very long ago, EragonÃ¢â‚¬â€Shadeslayer, Dragon RiderÃ¢â‚¬â€was nothing more than a poor farm boy, and his dragon, Saphira, only a blue stone in the forest. Now the fate of an entire civilization rests on their shoulders.\nLong months of training and battle have brought victories and hope, but they have also brought heartbreaking loss. And still, the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances. \nThe Rider and his dragon have come further than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to AlagaÃƒÂ«sia? And if so, at what cost?\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59b2de9166bec0ee7b0a107b8a7b767b9050f477","amp;dn":"Eragon+Quadrilogy+by+Christopher+Paolini+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59b2de9166bec0ee7b0a107b8a7b767b9050f477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,178,222,145,102,190,192,238,123,10,16,123,138,123,118,123,144,80,244,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
