The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn't published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.\nMorris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he's released from prison after 35 years.\nNot since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life - for good, for bad, forever.\n\nRead by Will Patton\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nLength: 13 hrs and 5 mins\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:06-02-15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a2ca754a11cbe9e109b2574cf8b0de88f385d28","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+Finders+Keepers+%28Bill+Hodges+Trilogy+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a2ca754a11cbe9e109b2574cf8b0de88f385d28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,44,167,84,161,28,190,158,16,155,37,116,207,139,13,232,143,56,93,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
