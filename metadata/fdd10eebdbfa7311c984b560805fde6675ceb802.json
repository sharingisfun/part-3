While children are inherently beautiful, they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t naturals at sitting still. This creates a hurdle for photographers attempting to capture the personalities of younger, restless subjects. However, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not impossible to get a child to pose for the camera Ã¢â‚¬â€ you just have to speak their language.\n\nAfter more than ten years of shooting, celebrated children's photographer Tamara Lackey has developed a language for effectively communicating with her younger clients. In this 3-day course, you will learn TamaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 10-point system designed to secure gorgeous, expressive images Ã¢â‚¬â€ including her formula for building to Ã¢â‚¬Å“the final shot.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBy the end of this workshop, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be armed with a toolkit of tried-and-true methods easily adaptable to your own style of shooting, transforming your childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s photography practice into a seamless workflow.\n\nSession 1 July 10, 2013\n  Day 1 Pre-Show\n  9:00 am - Introduction\n  9:15 am - Posing Rules\n  11:00 am - Clothing Review - Step 2\n  11:15 am - Location - Step 3\n  11:30 am - Mood Management - Step 4\n  11:45 am - 3 Point Lighting - Step 5\n  1:00 pm - Technical Settings - Step 6\n  1:10 pm - Composition &amp; Framing - Step 7 &amp; 8\n  1:15 pm - Details and Expression/Spirit - Step 9 &amp; 10\n  1:45 pm - Urban Shoot Challenges\n  2:00 pm - Photograph Critiques from Students and Audience\n  3:00 pm - Shoot: Bedroom with Baby Desmond\n  3:15 pm - Shoot: Bedroom with Alexis\n  3:30 pm - Shoot: Bedroom with Joseph\n  3:45 pm - Shoot: Bedroom with Alexis and Mom\n  Day 1 - Wrap-Up\n\nSession 2 July 11, 2013\n  Day 2 Pre-Show\n  9:00 am - Introduction\n  9:30 am - Composition and Framing\n  10:15 am - Relationship Dynamics\n  11:00 am - Park Shoot Challenges\n  1:00 pm - Critiques of Students and Photo Contest Submissions\n  1:45 pm - Editing Urban Shoot Photographs in Photoshop\n  2:45 pm - Shoot: Rooftop with Madeline\n  3:15 pm - Shoot: Rooftop with Aiden and Angelina\n  Day 2 Wrap-Up\n\nSession 3 July 12, 2013\n  Day 3 Pre-Show\n  9:00 am - Introduction\n  9:15 am - Shoot: Rooftop with Destyn and Ursula\n  9:45 am - Shoot: Rooftop with Rowan\n  Watch\n  10:00 am - Shoot: Rooftop with Mom and Baby\n  10:15 am - Shoot: Working with Motion with Destyn\n  11:00 am - Business Scorecard - Part 1\n  11:30 am - Business Scorecard - Part 2\n  1:00 pm - Shoot: Living Room with Ari, Eli, Zoe - Part 1\n  1:30 pm - Shoot: Living Room - Ari, Eli, Zoe - Part 2\n  2:00 pm - Shoot: Living Room with Baby Maria and Mom\n  Thanks + Credits\n  3:00 pm - Photo Contest Top 20\n  3:15 pm - Contest Winners\n  3:30 pm - Workshop Overview &amp; Photographs from Shoots\n  3:45 pm - Q&amp;A with Tamara and Final Thoughts\n  Day 3 Wrap-Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdd10eebdbfa7311c984b560805fde6675ceb802","amp;dn":"creativeLIVE+-+Children%27s+Posing+Guide+with+Tamara+Lackey+Descri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdd10eebdbfa7311c984b560805fde6675ceb802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,209,14,235,219,250,115,17,201,132,181,96,128,95,222,102,117,206,184,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
