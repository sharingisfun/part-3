Writing Dissertation and Grant Proposals: Epidemiology, Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics targets effective grant proposal writing in this highly competitive and evolving environment. Covering all aspects of the proposal writing process, the text:\n\nProvides summary checklists and step-by-step guidelines for grant structure and style alongside broader strategies for developing a research funding portfolio\nExplains how to avoid common errors and pitfalls, supplying critical do's and don'ts that aid in writing solid grant proposals\nDemonstrates proven tactics and illustrates key concepts with extensive examples from successfully funded proposalsWritten by an established NIH reviewer with inside knowledge and an impressive track record of funding, Writing Dissertation and Grant Proposals: Epidemiology, Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics is a virtual cookbook of the appropriate ingredients needed to construct a winning grant proposal. Therefore, the text is not only relevant for early-stage investigators including graduate students, medical students/residents, and postdoctoral fellows, but also valuable for experienced faculty, clinicians, epidemiologists, and health professionals who cannot seem to break the barrier to obtain NIH-funded research.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a123d2a548d5a6bfb62bb66e37031466edcef1b","amp;dn":"Writing+Dissertation+and+Grant+Proposals%3A+Epidemiology%2C+Preventi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a123d2a548d5a6bfb62bb66e37031466edcef1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,18,61,42,84,141,90,107,251,98,187,102,227,112,49,70,110,220,239,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
