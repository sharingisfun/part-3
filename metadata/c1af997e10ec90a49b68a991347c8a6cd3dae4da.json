After his time with Waters, Winter recorded several Grammy-nominated blues albums. In 1988, he was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame and in 2003, he was ranked 63rd in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.\n\nJohnny Winter was born in Beaumont, Texas, on February 23, 1944. Winter, along with his musician brother Edgar (born 1946), were nurtured at an early age by their parents in musical pursuits. Johnny and his brother, both of whom were born with albinism, began performing at an early age. When he was ten years old, Winter appeared on a local children's show, playing ukulele and singing Everly Brothers songs with his brother.\n\nHis recording career began at the age of fifteen, when his band Johnny and the Jammers released &quot;School Day Blues&quot; on a Houston record label. During this same period, he was able to see performances by classic blues artists such as Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and Bobby Bland.\n\nIn the early days Winter would sometimes sit in with Roy Head and the Traits when they performed in the Beaumont area, and in 1967, Winter recorded a single with the Traits: &quot;Tramp&quot; backed with &quot;Parchman Farm&quot; (Universal Records 30496). In 1968, he released his first album The Progressive Blues Experiment, on Austin's Sonobeat Records.\n\n\n\n\n\n1968 The Progressive Blues Experiment\n\n1969 Johnny Winter\n\n1969 Second Winter\n\n1970 Johnny Winter And\n\n1973 Still Alive and Well\n\n1974 Saints &amp; Sinners\n\n1974 John Dawson Winter III\n\n1977 Nothin' But The Blues\n\n1978 White, Hot And Blue\n\n1980 Raisin' Cain\n\n1984 Guitar Slinger\n\n1985 Serious Business\n\n1986 Third Degree\n\n1988 The Winter Of '88\n\n1991 Let Me In\n\n1992 Hey, Where's Your Brother?\n\n2004 I'm A Bluesman\n\n2011 Roots\n\n2014 Step Back\n\n\nBased on its selection of elemental blues and rock material, Johnny WinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Step Back is a logical extension of his previous record, the more literally conceived and executed Roots. The late TexanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final studio album lives up to the broad perspective at which its title hints with diverse arrangements that illustrate his versatility.\n\nStep Back also offers a litany of guests, not the least of whom is AerosmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Joe Perry, which serves as ample marketing fodder, but more importantly reaffirms the high level of inspiration Winter himself generates as he pays further homage to seminal influences that shaped his career. The bakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dozen tracks begins in rousing fashion with the horn-laden Ã¢â‚¬Å“Unchain My Heart,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ during which Winter and his regular accompanistsÃ¢â‚¬â€Scott Spray on bass, Tommy Curiale on drums, and Paul Nelson on guitarÃ¢â‚¬â€ mix with Hammond B3 organ, trumpet, trombone and sax plus background singers. A similar arrangement in which Dr. John appears on vocals and piano, bookends the album, investing as much logic in the track sequencing as the home stretch placement of the Winter solo track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death Letter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHere the Texan-born albino not only reminds his skill on acoustic instruments (here a National steel) equaled that on electric, but also that, while he was not gifted with a great voice, his has deepened with age so that his singing on this record sounds naturally emotive, especially on this Son House tune where his phrasing is so insinuating. Sounding every bit as comfortable (but not too much so) as he did with blues harp master Charlie Musselwhite, Ben Harper appears to sing and play slide on Ã¢â‚¬Å“CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Hold Out (Talk to Me Baby),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his role purely complementary with WinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, as is Eric ClaptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own on guitar on Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want No Woman.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The slightly more melodious tone Slowhand proffers makes for effective contrast to the edge emanating from WinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instrument.\n\nAs cleverly designed as it is handsome, the packaging of Step Back includes all the necessary credits of the musiciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ contributions on each track, and this attention to detail extends to the Paul Nelson production where the sound, as clear as it is, nevertheless maintains an earthy sheen. And as familiar as are some of the song choices, such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Killing FloorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Long Tall Sally,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no denying the lively interaction among the players: Frank Ã¢â‚¬Å“KingBeeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Latorre sounds as inspired on his harp on the former as Leslie West does with his electric guitar on the latter.\n\nAlong those same lines, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Do You LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ never descends into rote recitation, but rather takes a noticeably self-referential turn as the lyrics unfold prior to the smoldering rideout Winter offers as the track fades. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Okie Dokie StompÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ turns absolutely uproarious with the entry of the Blues Brothers Horns again, their appearance set up largely through the guitar work of Stray Cat Brian Setzer that imbues the instrumental cut with a lively spontaneity for its duration.\n\nThe molten sounds ZZ TopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Billy Gibbons adds to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where Can You BeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ illustrates the care with which such high profile collaborators, like Joe Bonamassa on the slow twelve-bar Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet Sixteen,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were chosen to match the material. Just as Johnny WinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live performances in recent years reaffirmed the legitimacy of his influence on generations of musicians, so does Step Back add final punctuation to a life-long statement of musical purpose.\n\n\nSeed This its great and those that listen are who your sharing it with so help em out....\n\n\nGenre: Rock\nSubgenre: Electric Blues Rock\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 1.93 GB\nseed this if you keep\n215 files ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1af997e10ec90a49b68a991347c8a6cd3dae4da","amp;dn":"+Johnny+Winter+-+Full-length+Discography+320k++%281968-2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1af997e10ec90a49b68a991347c8a6cd3dae4da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,175,153,126,16,236,144,164,155,104,169,145,52,124,138,108,211,218,228,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
