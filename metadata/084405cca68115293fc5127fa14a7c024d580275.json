On the street they call it Soy Sauce, and users can drift across time and dimensions. But some who come back are no longer human.\n\nSuddenly a silent, otherworldly invasion is underway, and mankind needs a hero. What it gets instead is John and David, a pair of college dropouts who can barely hold down jobs.\n\nCan these two stop the oncoming horror in time to save humanity?\n\nNo. No, they cant.\n\n\n\nComments appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084405cca68115293fc5127fa14a7c024d580275","amp;dn":"John+Dies+at+the+End+E-book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084405cca68115293fc5127fa14a7c024d580275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,68,5,204,166,129,21,41,63,197,18,127,161,74,124,2,77,88,2,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
