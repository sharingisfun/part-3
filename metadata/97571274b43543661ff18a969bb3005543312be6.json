I wrote this comprehensive guide for regular guys who want practical, logical, no bull advice on how to dress better. \n\nThis illustrated book is written for men who are beginning their style journey or for those who have been reading about fashion for a decade. It's jam packed with information, almost 300 pages (3000+ on kindle) on men's suits, sport jacket, shoes, trousers, boots, gloves, coats, hats, dressing for situations, and even why you should care about style in the first place. \n\nFrom dressing for black tie affairs to creating an interchangeable wardrobe to saving money on your clothes shopping to casual wear, it's all in here. I also included dozens of unique illustrations that we created to give you everything you need to start dressing like a man. \n\nAnd the best part? I am updating this book at least once a year so it is always getting better. I also support the book with a FREE series of poster size images so you can tie a necktie 18 different ways, see in detail how a suit should fit, or learn 11 ways to tie a scarf. All of this is at www.RealMenRealStyle.com, my main website that hosts over 1000 free articles and videos to support this book. \n\nLastly - I want to be clear my focus is on the man wearing the clothing. \n\nMy goal is for you to learn how to use clothing to get what you want out of life. I invite anyone who purchases this book to reach out to me via my contact form at Real Men Real Style. We get back to everyone and often create content based off your questions. \n\nSemper Fi, \n\nAntonio\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97571274b43543661ff18a969bb3005543312be6","amp;dn":"Dress+Like+a+Man-+A+Style+Guide+for+Practical+Men+-+Anthony+Cent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97571274b43543661ff18a969bb3005543312be6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,87,18,116,180,53,67,102,31,241,138,150,155,179,0,85,67,49,43,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
