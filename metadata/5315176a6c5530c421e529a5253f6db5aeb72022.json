The RPG game where you don't have to destroy anyone finally arrives to Android! (unofficially), this is possible because of an &quot;oversight&quot; by YoYo Games (the one who created GameMaker: Studio), because almost all YoYo Runners (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Android, iOS) use the same data files for every platform, so, you can &quot;port&quot; any Windows Game made with GameMaker: Studio to any of the platforms I mentioned.\n\nWelcome to UNDERTALE. In this RPG, you control a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever.\n\n((Healthy Dog's Warning: Game contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition.))\n\nFeatures:\n\nKilling is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system.\nTime your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters.\nOriginal art and soundtrack brimming with personality.\nSoulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor.\nCreated mostly by one person.\nBecome friends with all of the bosses!\nAt least 5 dogs.\nYou can date a skeleton.\nHmmm... now there are 6 dogs...?\nMaybe you won't want to date the skeleton.\nI thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog.\nIf you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it.\n\nMore Info: \nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/391540","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5315176a6c5530c421e529a5253f6db5aeb72022","amp;dn":"Undertale+v1.00","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5315176a6c5530c421e529a5253f6db5aeb72022","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,21,23,106,108,85,48,196,33,229,41,165,37,63,109,181,174,183,32,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
