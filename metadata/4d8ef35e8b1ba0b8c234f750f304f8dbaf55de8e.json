The Annual 2015 marks the 200th Ministry of Sound compilation released in Australia, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a must for any Ministry fanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collection! The Annual is THE guide to the best new and future hits of dance music, and this year features a very special third VIP disc.\n\nEmber has had a riotous year hitting the top spot on the ARIA Club Chart with his debut single, Blur and delivering jaw dropping sets as resident at AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s #1 club, Pacha Sydney. Ember mixes Disc One with the biggest summer hits blasting off with Armand Van HeldenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deep house remix of Sam SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Not The Only One and kicking on with the double platinum selling Timmy Trumpet &amp; Savage banger blowing up on radio, Freaks. Also featuring the biggest up and coming artists in the club world, including UK chart topper Oliver Heldens, the ARIA nominated Peking Duk and their new track featuring SAFIA, plus the latest from Porter Robinson, Duke Dumont and Alex Metric.\n\nKronic is one of AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production prodigies, operating as a reckless party starter with an alarming disregard for personal safety, all whilst killing the 2014 Beatport charts next to heavy competition. Disc Two features the Aussie guys bouncing off the walls here and internationally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Will Sparks, UberjakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d, SCNDL, The Only and Tigerlily, as well as an onslaught of international talent including Martin Garrix, Sander Van Doorn, Dillon Francis &amp; DJ Snake, DVBBS and Sigma.\n\nThe VIP disc is mixed in-house as a treat from the Ministry of Sound Studios in Sydney. The third disc of The Annual features Golden Features and Nicole Millar, SBTRKT, Route94, Kilter, Luke Million and Flight Facilities among more big names ahead of the game in house and electronica in 2015.\n\nThe Annual 2015 sees Ministry of Sound Australia popping the champagne on delivering 200 compilations of the best dance music from Australia and overseas. Unveil over 60 hits of fresh faced talent and get schooled with whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming up next with a 3 disc dance music experience curated and mixed by the best in the biz.\n\n\nThe Annual 2015 - Disc 1 mixed by Ember\n\n1.
