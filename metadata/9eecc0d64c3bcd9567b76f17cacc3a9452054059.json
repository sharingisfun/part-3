A graduate of Stanford University, Tess went on to medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, where she was awarded her M.D.\n\nWhile on maternity leave from her work as a physician, she began to write fiction. In 1987, her first novel was published. Call After Midnight, a romantic thriller, was followed by eight more romantic suspense novels. She also wrote a screenplay, &quot;Adrift&quot;, which aired as a 1993 CBS Movie of the Week starring Kate Jackson.\n\nTess's first medical thriller, Harvest, was released in hardcover in 1996, and it marked her debut on the New York Times bestseller list. Her suspense novels since then have been: Life Support (1997), Bloodstream (1998), Gravity (1999), The Surgeon (2001), The Apprentice (2002), The Sinner (2003), Body Double (2004), Vanish (2005), The Mephisto Club (2006), and The Bone Garden (2007).
