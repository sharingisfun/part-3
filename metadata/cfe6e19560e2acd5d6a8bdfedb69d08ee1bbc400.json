These official CD reissue are the first official ones. Their sound is phenomenal and the strange dropouts and fades are intentional. They are worthy packages. Oddly enough, after a millennial change and a constant stream of samples being taken from it, and its influence saturating both the rock and electronica scenes, it still sounds ahead of its time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe6e19560e2acd5d6a8bdfedb69d08ee1bbc400","amp;dn":"NEU+%21+-+NEU+%21+-+1972+%281st+Album%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe6e19560e2acd5d6a8bdfedb69d08ee1bbc400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,230,225,149,96,226,172,213,214,168,189,254,219,105,208,142,225,187,196,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
