The dialogue also discusses the role of the philosopher, Plato's Theory of Forms, the place of poetry, and the immortality of the soul.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a14a28aa225cd806fa7a4967f80685eea53efa6","amp;dn":"Plato+-+The+Republic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a14a28aa225cd806fa7a4967f80685eea53efa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,20,162,138,162,37,205,128,111,167,164,150,127,128,104,94,234,83,239,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
