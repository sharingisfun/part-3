His philosophical theories addressed the nature of power and the manner in which it functions, the means by which it controls knowledge and vice versa, and how it is used as a form of social control.  Foucault is best known for his critical studies of social institutions, most notably psychiatry, the social anthropology of medicine, the human sciences, the prison system, and the history of human sexuality.  His writings on power, knowledge, and discourse have been widely influential in academic circles.\n\n\nThis is a significantly revised and expanded version of an earlier torrent.
