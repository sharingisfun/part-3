Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotryÃ¢â‚¬â€a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.\n\nBalancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious Ã¢â‚¬Å“King of the JewsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.\n\nZealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of NazarethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea9eb3ffd403d19c0d8b744580f032ef55d2af5","amp;dn":"Zealot%3A+The+Life+and+Times+of+Jesus+-+Reza+Aslan+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea9eb3ffd403d19c0d8b744580f032ef55d2af5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,169,235,63,253,64,61,25,192,216,183,68,88,15,3,46,245,93,42,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
