These personas are called player characters (PCs) or just characters. In most games, each player creates just one character and uses that character to interact with the imagined setting in structured or unstructured scenarios called stories. The PCs, then, are the principal charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€the protagonistsÃ¢â‚¬â€of the story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3fc6d9a33058902590a2db7238fd820abd383d6","amp;dn":"A+Song+of+Ice+and+Fire+Roleplaying","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3fc6d9a33058902590a2db7238fd820abd383d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,252,109,154,51,5,137,2,89,10,45,183,35,143,216,32,171,211,131,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
