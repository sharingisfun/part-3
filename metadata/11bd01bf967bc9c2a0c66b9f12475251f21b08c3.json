In addition to touring the country, he has appeared as a regular on the stand-up/improv-based television shows Comic View, Def Comedy Jam, Last Comic Standing, and Nick Cannon Presents Wild 'n Out. He has appeared in two comedy specials of his own, Corey Holcomb: The Problem Is You and Comedy Central Presents: Corey Holcomb.\n\n\nAs an actor, Holcomb has appeared as guest star on several sitcoms such as Half &amp; Half and Everybody Hates Chris, as well as minor roles in films such as Like Mike and Dance Flick. Holcomb is a recurring voice actor for the Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, for which he provides the voice of Roberta's ex-husband, and Cleveland's rival, Robert. Holcomb has been a regular personality on Jamie Foxx's satellite radio channel The Foxxhole since 2007. He currently hosts his own program, The Corey Holcomb 5150 Show, on Monday nights on the Foxxhole, live from the Conga Room.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11bd01bf967bc9c2a0c66b9f12475251f21b08c3","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Corey+Holcomb+-+The+Problem+Is+You+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11bd01bf967bc9c2a0c66b9f12475251f21b08c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,189,1,191,150,123,201,194,160,198,107,159,18,71,82,81,242,27,8,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
