The band built a considerable following, especially within the British counterculture, before splitting up in 1974. The group's members are musical pioneers in psychedelic folk and, by integrating a wide variety of traditional music forms and instruments, in the development of world music. The group reformed in 1999 and continued to perform until 2006.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Incredible String Band is the debut album by the band of the same name. Released in 1966, it is the only one of the band's albums to feature the original trio line-up with Clive Palmer as well as Robin Williamson and Mike Heron.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion is the second LP by The Incredible String Band, released in July 1967.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Hangman's Beautiful Daughter was the third album by The Incredible String Band, released in March 1968. It is regarded by many as a quintessential example of hippie culture, with its promotion of ideas such as communal living, eastern mysticism and rationalistic pantheism.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWee Tam and the Big Huge is the fourth album by the Incredible String Band, released in Europe as both a double LP and separate single LPs in November 1968. In the US, however, the two discs were released separately as Wee Tam and The Big Huge.\n\nThe album is considered by many to be, along with its predecessor The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, the best work the band ever produced. Consisting of a very varied selection of songs by Robin Williamson and Mike Heron, with intriguing and poetic lyrics, the album is rich with eclectic and adept instrumentation and arrangements. Around 15 instruments are featured, played mainly by the two band members Williamson and Heron but also, in supporting roles, on a few tracks by Rose Simpson and Licorice McKechnie.\n\nWilliamson explained the title as follows:- &quot;I saw a man with a huge big dog, [and] we knew somebody called Wee Tam, in Edinburgh. It seemed like it was a good idea in terms of one person looking up at the stars - Wee Tam and the Big Huge, just like the vastness of the universe.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8516fcb0ea3cdbab2f0c4011225a37d8f7338bc7","amp;dn":"The+Incredible+String+Band-Original+Album+Series+%5B5CD%5D%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8516fcb0ea3cdbab2f0c4011225a37d8f7338bc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,22,252,176,234,60,219,171,47,12,64,17,34,90,55,216,247,51,139,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
