In the completely original storyline, the super-spy finds himself on the trail of a corrupt businessman who's hatched a plan to use a secret weapon to destroy the world. Bond's quest to stop the terrorist before he can do any harm takes him across the world through a variety of first-person shooter and driving levels, deep into the ocean, and soaring into space. Much of the game (including the four-player multiplayer mode) is played in the first-person perspective, but there are also racing action stages that utilize the Need for Speed game engine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6926f20ed873b42328f68c3609a7eebd1e77c0f","amp;dn":"James+Bond+007%3A+Nightfire+%5BPS2%5D+%5BNTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6926f20ed873b42328f68c3609a7eebd1e77c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,146,111,32,237,135,59,66,50,143,104,195,96,154,126,235,209,231,124,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
