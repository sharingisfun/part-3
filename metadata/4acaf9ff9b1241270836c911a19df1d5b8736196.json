It encourages you to move beyond your comfort zones in search of stories. We all write what we know - how could we not? Writing what you don't know and doing it in an informed and imaginative way is what makes the process worthwhile. Hoxter draws on his wealth of experience teaching young film students to offer help with every aspect of the writing process, including how we come up with ideas in the first place. Light hearted and full of insight into the roundabout way film students approach their scripts, it also discusses the important issues like the difference between stories and plots and what your characters should be doing in the middle of act two. &quot;Write What You Don't Know&quot; contains examples and case studies from a wide range of movies, both mainstream and alternative such as &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot;, &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, &quot;For The Birds&quot;, &quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot;, &quot;Juno&quot;, &quot;Up In The Air&quot;, &quot;Knocked Up&quot; and &quot;Brick&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4acaf9ff9b1241270836c911a19df1d5b8736196","amp;dn":"Write+What+You+Don%27t+Know%3A+An+Accessible+Manual+for+Screenwriter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4acaf9ff9b1241270836c911a19df1d5b8736196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,202,249,255,155,18,65,39,8,54,201,17,161,157,241,213,184,115,97,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
