Robert Barron - Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith (EPUB, MOBI)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“What I propose to do in this book is to take you on a guided exploration of the Catholic world, but not in the manner of a docent, for I am not interested in showing you the artifacts of Catholicism as though they were dusty objets dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢art in a museum of culture. I want to function rather as a mystagogue, conducting you ever deeper into the mystery of the incarnation in the hopes that you might be transformed by its power.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œFather Robert Barron\n\nWhat is Catholicism? A 2,000-year-old living tradition? A worldview? A way of life? A relationship? A mystery? In Catholicism Father Robert Barron examines all these questions and more, seeking to capture the body, heart and mind of the Catholic faith.\n\nStarting from the essential foundation of Jesus ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incarnation, life, and teaching, Father Barron moves through the defining elements of Catholicism Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from sacraments, worship, and prayer, to Mary, the Apostles, and Saints, to grace, salvation, heaven, and hell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ using his distinct and dynamic grasp of art, literature, architecture, personal stories, Scripture, theology, philosophy, and history to present the Church to the world.\n\nPaired with his documentary film series of the same title, Catholicism is an intimate journey, capturing Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Catholic ThingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in all its depth and beauty. Eclectic, unique, and inspiring, Father Barron brings the faith to life for a new generation, in a style that is both faithful to timeless truths, while simultaneously speaking in the language of contemporary life.\n\nIncludes over 100 black and white and color photos.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Clarity, intelligence, passion and elegance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ these are the marks of a writer in top form, and Father Barron brings all these gifts to bear in this extraordinary reflection on the Catholic faith. If you read one book this year on what Catholics believe and why, this is the book to read Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and to share with others.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œCharles J. Chaput, O.F.M. Cap, Archbishop of Philadelphia\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Father Robert BarronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith takes a path less traveled in leading us to explore the faith through stories, biographies, and images. In these pages, we meet the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Word made FleshÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ not only in theological formulations, but also in saints and poets, cathedrals and chants, priests and prophets. What makes Catholicism so compelling are the ways in which Father Barron shows how the Incarnation goes on in the true, the good, and the beautiful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Timothy M. Dolan, Archbishop of New York\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Catholicism is one of the most significant efforts ever to advance what Pope John Paul II called Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe New Evangelization.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œGeorge Weigel, author of Witness to Hope and The End and the Beginning\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Prepare yourself for an entrancing tour of the many facets of Catholicism. From Her art to Her architecture, Her theological riches, to the inspired personalities that have filled Her pews, the Catholic Church is laid bare by a priest who is more than up to the task. Like the Faith it seeks to capture, it is a journey that will leave you full Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and then hungering for more.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œRaymond Arroyo, New York Times Bestselling Author of Mother Angelica and host of EWTN's The World Over Live\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Father Robert Barron is a brilliant academic, a popular writer, a seeker and a seer. In Catholicism he illuminates truths that have the power to set us free. It will be a benchmark book for years to come.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œMichael Leach, author of Why Stay Catholic?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When Father Barron is talking, I can't stop listening. Whatever he writes, I can't put down unfinished. He loves the people he addresses. He writes about what matters to us. To read him is to be loved in word after word. In these pages, heart speaks to heart.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œMike Aquilina, co-author of The Mass: The Glory, the Mystery, the Tradition\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Father Robert BarronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great gift is to wed intellectual depth with clarity and vividness of expression. His Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith is a superb exploration of the Catholic vision that seamlessly unites theological reflection and masterpieces of architecture and art. The story he tells comes truly alive in his portraits of concrete men and women who, in every age, have lived the journey of faith to the full. Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Rev. Robert Imbelli is Associate Professor of Theology at Boston College\n\nFather Robert Barron is the founder of Word on Fire Catholic Ministries, the Rector of Mundelein Seminary, and the host of CATHOLICISM, a groundbreaking, award winning documentary about the Catholic Faith. He received a Master's Degree in Philosophy from the Catholic University of America (1982) and a doctorate in Sacred Theology from the Institut Catholique de Paris (1992).\n\nHe has published numerous books, essays, and articles on theology and the spiritual life. He has also appeared on several media outlets including NBC, PBS, FOX News, CNN, and EWTN. His website, WordOnFire.org, has reached over 3.8 million people and his weekly YouTube videos have been viewed over nine million times. His pioneering work in evangelizing through the new media led Cardinal Francis George, Archbishop of Chicago, to describe him as Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the Church's best messengers.&quot;\n\n--\n\nPlease seed!\n\nMore:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/ancapcatholic/&quot;
