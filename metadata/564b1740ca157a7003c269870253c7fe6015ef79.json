Doc is a \nlonely marine biologist (and former baseball star) who supplies specimens\nfor science labs and classrooms. Suzy is a scrappy drifter who can't even\nsucceed as a prostitute because of her abrasive manner. When the two get \ntogether, it's fireworks, though not the romantic kind. Not to worry, \neverything is in the hands of Cannery Row's resident guardian angels, Mack\nand the boys, a band of drunken derelicts whose hearts are in the right \nplace, even though their brains are not.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:564b1740ca157a7003c269870253c7fe6015ef79","amp;dn":"Cannery.Row.1982.DVBRip.XviD-Movieboys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"564b1740ca157a7003c269870253c7fe6015ef79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,75,23,64,202,21,122,112,3,194,105,135,2,83,199,254,96,21,239,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
