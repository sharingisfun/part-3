Drafted into the newly-formed Machine Gun Corps, he is sent to fight in places whose names will forever be associated with mud, blood, and sacrifice: Ypres, the Somme, and Passchendaele. He is one of the &quot;lucky&quot; ones, surviving more than two-and-a-half years of the terrible slaughter that left nearly a million British soldiers dead by 1918 and wiped out all but six of his original company. He wrote these memoirs 50 years later, but found his memories of life in the trenches had not diminished at all. The sights and sounds of battle, the excitement, the terror, and the extraordinary comradeship are all vividly described as if they had happened to him only yesterday","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7084a72a73e385a61694d7c4f9746117aca95eb7","amp;dn":"Mud%2C+Blood+and+Bullets%2C+Memoirs+of+a+Machine+Gunner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7084a72a73e385a61694d7c4f9746117aca95eb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,132,167,42,115,227,133,166,22,148,215,196,249,116,97,23,172,169,94,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
