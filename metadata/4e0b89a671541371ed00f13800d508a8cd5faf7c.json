Here we have the whole &quot;3000&quot; crew cutting up to Andre, a.k.a. Sunny Bridges&amp;#039;, whip-smart concoctions--Li&amp;#039;l D, Kim and Kam, Tamika, Madison, Philly Phil, and Edward trade the spotlight on weird but wickedly fun tracks like &quot;Banana Zoo,&quot; &quot;Oh Peanut,&quot; and &quot;We Want Your Soul.&quot; The messages seep through, but in the end the grooves matter most. Future funkers of America, take note. And tune in immediately.\n\n1. Class of 3000 Theme \t(4:11)\n2. Life Without Music (2:09)\n3. Throwdown (2:53)\n4. Oh Peanut (2:55)\n5.
