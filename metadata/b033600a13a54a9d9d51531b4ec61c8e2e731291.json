We have kept this offering to 4GB so as to\nfit on a single layer disc as they are most reasonable to purchase and share with.\nWe have watched all the files from beginning to end as a final step before this\nlaunch.\n\nPlease note: \nWe are on minimal speed at early evenings due to throttling however we are \nlaunching at several times our usual speed to get you on your way. Please share\nand consider seeding this great series too with us - we are trying to improve our\nworld using these means too.\n\nPride and Prejudice is a wake-up call for those that choose to display\na tendency to hatefulness which they need not do, and which they can instead\ncontrol using their better instincts and judgment. This is true of the character\nof Mr. Darcy who nonethleless has his redeeming qualities, guided by\nthe alluring Ms. Elizabeth. I find myself personally quite taken by Ms. Charlotte\nwho it appears is resigned to her lot in life absent of romantic fulfillment\nin what is an era concerned with security and comfort in the basics of life\nequally - or even more so perhaps.\n\nAs to the culture that saw many women as lower forms of beings in some respect\nif their families didn't match in attainment of wealth as similar levels to\nthe superior achievers, or who might be ostracized in all of their prospects for \nhappiness or fortune for the mishap of a single elopement in the family (and what\nhave you), thank goodness for progress in our world! It is an education indeed\nto hear British culture as practiced at the time described in the words used\nin plain fashion in this writing of Jane Austen most particularly I think -\namidst other such writers in any event.\n\nLets decide to equally render obsolete (anachronistic in respect of propriety)\nthe musings of Mr. Darcy who Miss Elizabeth describes as a man lacking true\nvirtue at the start in that he displays too much of a propensity to hate all\nthat he encounters rather than putting some more sense into his views as she\nthinks he might do instead.\n\nIn any event, her beauty and charm win the day as he is certainly won over in his\nefforts to improve himself morally in this respect.\n\nAll's well that ends well, so I will not dwell any further on what misgvings\none might have of the views of Mr. Darcy in his poor handling of  the feelings\nof others (such as Miss Elizabeth) at the outset - obviously he isn't\nincorrigible certainly and therefore this novel indicates hope for all of\nmindset i think. A great romantic story in perhaps the most celebrated\nof novels written in the English language.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b033600a13a54a9d9d51531b4ec61c8e2e731291","amp;dn":"Pride+and+Prejudice+%28BBC+1995%29+720p+DivX+AVI+4GB+moviesbyrizzo++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b033600a13a54a9d9d51531b4ec61c8e2e731291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,51,96,10,19,165,74,157,157,81,83,27,78,198,28,142,46,115,18,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
