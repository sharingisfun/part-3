Applying the current and best scientific evidence to treatment at both individual and population level is intrinsically linked to epidemiology and public health, and has been introduced in a brand new second section: Ã¢â‚¬ËœEvidence-based MedicineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (EBM), with advice on how to incorporate EBM principles into your own practice. The third section, 'Public Health', introduces students to public health practice, including strategies and tools used to prevent disease, prolong life, reduce inequalities, and includes global health.\n\nThoroughly updated throughout, including new studies and cases from around the globe, key learning features include:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Learning objectives and key points in every chapter\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extended coverage of critical appraisal and data interpretation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A brand new self-assessment section of SAQs and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢True/FalseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ questions for each topic\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A glossary to quickly identify the meaning of key terms, all of which are highlighted for study and exam preparation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Further reading suggestions on each topic\n\nWhether approaching these topics for the first time, starting a special study module or placement, or looking for a quick-reference summary, this book offers medical students, junior doctors, and public health students an invaluable collection of theoretical and practical information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a479a4e5b1504a4fc9c47a324d4afec483c05cb","amp;dn":"Lecture+Notes+Epidemiology%2C+6E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a479a4e5b1504a4fc9c47a324d4afec483c05cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,71,154,78,91,21,4,164,252,156,71,163,36,212,175,236,72,60,5,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
