It doesn't matter whether we're playing uno or any sort of game she has to win and I sort of have that now.&quot;\nThe couple met while they were working as competing journalists in Broome. And luckily four-year-younger Drasko won her over quickly because ambitious Bianca was all set to move to London for a career opportunity.\n&quot;And that all kind of went out the window,&quot; admits 31-year-old Bianca. &quot;I think paths change and people come into your life and yeah you just have to go with the flow.&quot;\nBorn in Serbia, Drasko, 27, moved to Australia when he was just three. But his earliest food memory is back in his homeland helping his dad with a pig on a spit.\n&quot;In Serbia they do it manually so they rotisserie the pig manually. And I just remember sitting on my dad's lap and helping him turn the pig around the coal fire and that was my first food memory I'd have to say.&quot;\nAnd that first memory has come full circle for Drasko recently, admitting he wants to become a chef.\n&quot;I've spent about five years chasing a career that's driven by money,&quot; he admits. &quot;And now I've realised it doesn't get me up in the morning. And I'm like I've got so much more to live I need something that's going to get me up in the morning and that's what food is.&quot;\nWhile he was a little hesitant at first to chase his dream, his supportive partner of five years gave him the push he needed.\n&quot;He didn't want to admit it to me because he said there's no money in being a chef. But to me that doesn't matter; I'd rather he be happy,&quot; says Bianca.\nDrasko has been indulging his love of food for some time and will drive halfway across Perth for one ingredient.\nHe is most confident at a BBQ or slow cooking using traditional Serbian recipes. But he has learnt so much about cooking, including Asian flavours and how to cook seafood from his fiancÃƒÂ©.\n&quot;I didn't like chilli before I met Bianca and now I have it on my eggs on toast for breakfast,&quot; he says. &quot;I can't really have a meal without chilli now. So Bianca has really influenced my cooking a lot as well.&quot;\nBianca's background includes Burmese and Portuguese heritage, as well as a stint living in Indonesia when she was younger.\n&quot;If I were to describe our cooking style it's 100 percent fusion,&quot; says Drasko.\n&quot;Cooking relaxes us, but also there's a lot of passion between us in the kitchen. Bianca always thinks she's right and I always think I'm right. And it's good, you can get playful with it. It brings out a lot of different emotions in us.&quot;\nThere's nothing this adventurous pair won't try once","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01e46a952b9ac2b9fcd1b4d5daf6ef991c905f34","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.s06e13.WS.PDTV.x264.BF1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01e46a952b9ac2b9fcd1b4d5daf6ef991c905f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,228,106,149,43,154,194,185,252,209,180,213,218,246,239,153,28,144,95,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
