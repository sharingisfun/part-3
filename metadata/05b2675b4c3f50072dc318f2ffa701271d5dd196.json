Dan Snow boards a yacht on the English Channel to get a sense of the naval battle, revealing how tensions between England and Spain were fuelled by religion, piracy and Elizabeth I's rejection of King Philip II of Spain as a suitor 30 years earlier, and how a missed opportunity could have resulted in disaster.\n\n2)  The Battle for England \nDan Snow relives the events of the naval battle in 1588, drawing on recently rediscovered documents to get a sense of the key events in the conflict and exposing the tensions among the Spanish commanders. Dramatic reconstructions go behind the scenes in Elizabeth I's royal court, revealing the impact the prospect of invasion had on the queen and her advisors as she tried to maintain a strong public image while under the threat of an assassination attempt.\n\n3)  Endgame \nDan Snow concludes the three-part drama-documentary exploring the battle against the Spanish Armada. The final episode reveals the circumstances that led to the defeat of the invasion force, drawing on recently rediscovered documents, and also explores how victory enhanced Elizabeth I's reputation as a world leader - while many of the sailors who fought in the battle died of starvation and disease.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b3fbdad4dbf3ff879d82&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (2741 Kbps)\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.19 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05b2675b4c3f50072dc318f2ffa701271d5dd196","amp;dn":"BBC.Armada.12.Days.to.Save.England.2of3.The.Battle.for.England.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05b2675b4c3f50072dc318f2ffa701271d5dd196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,178,103,91,76,63,80,7,45,195,24,242,255,167,1,39,29,93,209,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
