CBR 32 kbps\nPublishing House: Blackstone Audio Books Inc. \nUnabridged\nReader: Barrett Whitener \nRuntime: 13:39\nSize: 189 MG\n\nSynopsis taken from From Library Journal \nNarrator Barrett Whitener renders Toole's cast of caricatures with verve enough to satisfy admirers. Toole wrote this novel in Puerto Rico during a hitch in the U.S. Army. In 1966 it was rejected by Simon &amp; Schuster. In 1969 Toole committed suicide. Toole's mother then tried to get it published. After seven years of rejection she showed it to novelist Walker Percy, under whose encouragement it was published by Louisiana State University Press. Many critics praised it as a comic masterpiece that memorably evokes the city of New Orleans and whose robust protagonist is a modern-day Falstaff, Don Quixote, or Gargantua. Toole's prose is energetic, and his talent, had it matured, may have produced a masterpiece.\n\n\nAmazon:\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Confederacy-Dunces-John-Kennedy-Toole/dp/0786182466/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217532118&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Confederacy-Dunces-John-Kennedy-Toole/dp/0786182466/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217532118&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n============================================================\n\nMore NFO here on the forum: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;pid=140610#pid140610&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;pid=140610#pid140610&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(Scroll down a bit)\n\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\nReport bad torrents here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy uploads: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f21532da17a75464daf6c95fdb6c2ab3e97e18a9","amp;dn":"John+Kennedy+Toole%3A+A+Confederacy+Of+Dunces+%5BUnabridged%5D+%5B101%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f21532da17a75464daf6c95fdb6c2ab3e97e18a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,21,50,218,23,167,84,100,218,246,201,95,219,108,42,179,233,126,24,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
