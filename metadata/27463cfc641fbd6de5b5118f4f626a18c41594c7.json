Its easy and simple.\n\nOur technology is based on the art of sewing and patternmaking (making the blueprint for a garment), which we believe is the only way to truly express the garment realistically. You dont need a fashion design background to create clothing using Marvelous designer. It is surprisingly easy and simple with our intuitive tools. Build your skills by mastering our online curriculum.\n\nEasy to use software that just makes sense.\n\nDesigning Ã¢â‚¬Å“true to lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ virtual garments is easy and straightforward with our intuitive user interface and tools such as arrangement points and pins. Marvelous Designer saves you from guessing how clothes should fit in real life.\nTextural coordinates are packaged along with your patterns for simple data translation and use. Edit textures, fabrics and physical properties via our preset library to accurately simulate onto your characters without costing countless hours.\n\nAugmented capability with your existing software tools.\n\nAcross modeling and animation, Marvelous Designer can easily import and export data between software including Maya, 3DS Max, Softimage, Modo and ZBrush. Major game studios like EA and Ubisoft as well as the animated film studios behind Avatar (Weta Digital) and Total Recall (Double Negative) have taken advantage of our softwares compatibility.\n\nIntricate Details.\n\nYou can add rich details onto garments ranging from shoulder pads to stitches.\n\nAuthentic simulation for amazing animation.\n\nBringing your characters to life doesnt have to take a lifetime. Traditional modeling and sculpting techniques require hours of work for each wrinkle, band, and fold and cant guarantee convincing results. Marvelous Designers animation cache functionality with high-polygon modeling makes it possible to capture the realistic movement of clothing when draped onto moving characters whether they are running, jumping, or twirling in midair.\n\nRevolutionizing 3D virtual clothing.\n\nMarvelous Designers novel pattern-based approach allows not only for beautiful graphics, but also compiles your garments\ndata to be reused, revamped, and refreshed again and again.\n\n-Pattern Creation and Editing: Our expansive pattern design feature lets you easily create and edit rectangular, circular, or any other polygon shaped patterns. In addition, we provide intuitive interfaces such as moving point/segment in parallel/perpendicular fashion, moving point/segment via input value, or dividing a segment proportionally.\n\n-Segment and Free Sewing: Our simple and smart sewing tool makes life easier for users.You can easily create and edit seam lines with more freedom in sewing directions and range, accurate sewing has been extremely difficult to articulate in other 3D CAD software due to the limitations in its narrow directions and range.\n\nWhat's new in version [1.4.0.0]\n\n- [Added] Avatar motion 'mtn' save with selected range.\n- [Added] Coloring the thick layer of a pattern\n- [Added] Double-side coloring on each side of fabrics.\n- [Added] Inner shape lock/hide\n- [Added] OBJ export with print overlay\n- [Added] OBJ export with thickness option\n- [Added] Obj to cloth (rigid body simulation) part 1\n- [Added] Save OBJ with texture as zip format\n\n- [Improved] Seam line activation after 'Deactivate' and 'Freeze'\n- [Improved] [mac] Exception handling in installer regarding registry\n- [Improved] A new list is always created when zfab file is dropped\n- [Improved] Animation is not automatically played when in animation mode\n- [Improved] Can delete AP and BV in the avatar window directly.\n- [Improved] Changed the menu name of pattern lock\n- [Improved] Clothes rendering style kept with user preset\n- [Improved] Diffuse color is shown in the top in the material property window when selecting avatar\n- [Improved] Fitting Display improved\n- [Improved] Manual .anm file playing after open.\n- [Improved] Measure property highlight color changed\n- [Improved] Mesh is not moved if clicked even if simulation is on\n- [Improved] Pattern texture scale synchronization\n- [Improved] Print texture copy and paste by 'Ctrl+C' and 'Ctrl+V'.\n- [Improved] Simulation automatically stopped with new pattern created\n\n- [Fixed] [Linux] Crash in when saving zfab file, load zfab file, when drag&amp;drop png file in 3D window\n- [Fixed] [Linux] Translation of pattern is larger than gizmo's movement\n- [Fixed] [Linux] When zfab file made in windows is modified in linux, it shows as being created in a higher version when opened in windows\n- [Fixed] [Linux] zprj file not opening in MD\n- [Fixed] [mac, linux] Certain zprj does not open properly\n- [Fixed] [mac] Freezes when saving\n- [Fixed] [mac] path error when path included japanese or korean\n- [Fixed] 2D window does not update properly when reloading garment file during pattern lock\n- [Fixed] After deactivate and freeze, mesh does not undo properly\n- [Fixed] Animation recording bug when inserting print texture and not synchronizing + simulation\n- [Fixed] Back of pattern rendered with front fabric color in 3D window\n- [Fixed] Bump map does not work\n- [Fixed] Can edit inner shape/line that was locked using the transform pattern tool\n- [Fixed] Cant change fps when importing point cache\n- [Fixed] Certain obj texture disappeared\n- [Fixed] Clothes pattern selected with hidden on the texture edit tool mode\n- [Fixed] Crash after import obj after making another obj transparent\n- [Fixed] Crash after loading default garment when there is hole in pattern, and pin was created\n- [Fixed] Crash after using texture scale edit\n- [Fixed] Crash when changing from Multi Pinning Mode to Move Pattern Mode\n- [Fixed] Crash when controlling the viewport after moving pattern with gizmo\n- [Fixed] Crash when deactivate-simulate\n- [Fixed] Crash when deleting point in arrangement point list when there is no avatar\n- [Fixed] Crash when deleting texture when a pattern with that texture is right clicked\n- [Fixed] Crash when undo-ing change in elastic property in pattern\n- [Fixed] Crashes after recording animation, then loading animation in simulation mode\n- [Fixed] Crashes in simulation\n- [Fixed] Crashes when deleting obj map\n- [Fixed] Crashes when moving inner shape/line in 3D avatar window after locking\n- [Fixed] Crashes when pattern was freezed and simulation was turned on and off\n- [Fixed] Crashes when using ctrl-a during box selection\n- [Fixed] Crashes when using drag and drop place fabric file to the fabric list\n- [Fixed] Edge part of garment is not smooth\n- [Fixed] Entire cloth is hidden when using strain map, stress map, then turning the simulation off and clicking pattern in 3d window\n- [Fixed] Esc does not work when clicking pattern, then using ctrl-c -&gt;
