It grew partly out of the new freedom of expression in post-Napoleonic France, and partly out of the new importance given to landscape and open-air painting through the work of artists such as Constable and Corot. The name came by chance when a group of young painters, including Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Sisley and Cezanne, tired of being rejected by the official Salon, decided to hold their own exhibition. One of Monet's paintings was called Impression: Sunrise - this was derided by a hostile critic and so the term 'Impressionists' was born - originally a term of abuse. This beautifully illustrated volume shows 50 masterpieces by these Impressionists, who initially had received such a hostile reception","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:339ef1ab5ae6945cebb323cdf50b3882c38ca525","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+the+Impressionists+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"339ef1ab5ae6945cebb323cdf50b3882c38ca525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,158,241,171,90,230,148,92,235,179,35,205,245,11,56,130,195,140,165,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
