Software Quality Engineering studies the tenets of both of these notions, which focus on the efficiency and value of a design, respectively. The text addresses engineering quality on both the application and system levels with attention to Information Systems and Embedded Systems as well as recent developments. Targeted at graduate engineering students and software quality specialists, the book analyzes the relationship between functionality and quality with practical applications to related ISO/IEC JTCI SC7 standards.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e99caeb4d1c9a352d77c97e5987e642bb2776c","amp;dn":"Software+Quality+Engineering+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e99caeb4d1c9a352d77c97e5987e642bb2776c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,233,156,174,180,209,201,163,82,215,124,151,229,152,126,100,43,178,119,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
