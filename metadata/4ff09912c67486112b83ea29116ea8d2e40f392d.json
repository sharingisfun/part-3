In addition to remembering the Sabbath, Eyehategod set out to set the concept of ugliness to music.\n\nThe first slab of feedback and volume-based mental obliteration, &quot;In the Name of Suffering&quot; was recorded and released in 1991/92, originally on a small French label called Intellectual Convulsions, but later on Century Media, which allowed the band much wider exposure. The negativity condensed again on the next releaseEyehategod, titled (appropriately enough) &quot;Take As Needed For Pain&quot;, featuring a slightly different, but like-minded, line-up.\n\nSteve Dale was replaced on bass by Marc Schultz, and Brian Patton of swampgrind maniacs Soilent Green stepped in on second guitar. The music was loud, ugly and undeniably a reflection of the Big Easy. The notoriety gained from the loud-as-fuck sound and punk ethos of the releases garnered the band some touring slots with such notables as Godlfesh, Napalm Death and Corrosion of Conformity.\n\nAs the band progressed down the road to infamy, the tone of the music became more unsettling, more abrasive and just generally un-fucking-friendly Eyehategod, culminating in the aptly titled (and perhaps band mantra) &quot;Dopesick&quot;. Songs about the bleakness of existence, the pointlessness of life, and an assload of negativity all oozed off this album like black rain. Tours followed with Pantera, White Zombie, Crowbar and Soilent Green, but in 1998 years of hard living finally took a toll on Mike Williams and the band fell apart. In 2000, Century Media released a compilation of rare material and splits called &quot;Southern Discomfort&quot;.\n\nOne thing that anyone forgot to consider is that the band was left for dead, but wasn&quot;t... After getting sobered up and getting their problems behind them, Eyehategod was brought back to life, kicking and screaming. In 2001, the band put together the next chapter in the saga: &quot;The Confederacy Of Ruined Lives&quot;. The intention was clear, the direction solidified and this time the so-called &quot;underground&quot; bands that had done no more than copy Eyehategod&quot;s sound and venomous attitude were kicked in the teeth and left to bleed.\n\nIn 2002, Eyehategod released a split 7&quot; with swampgrinders Soilent Green. The all-new track &quot;The Age Of Bootcamp&quot; shows what direction the band takes next: a driving attack, vicious, relentless and aimed for the jugular.\n\nThis is the new voice of nihilism. Pain does not matter. Pleasure does not matter. Lead, follow, or get the fuck out of the way.\n\n\nEyehategod At MySpace\n\n\n1992 In The Name Of Suffering\n\n1993 Take As Needed For Pain\n\n1996 Dopesick\n\n2000 Confederacy Of Ruined Lives\n\n2014 Eyehategod\n\n\nEyehategodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new self-titled record is one born out of tribulation. Pulling it together to pen a new record 14 years after the release of its predecessor Confederacy of Ruined Lives, the incumbent kings of drug-addled sludge metal miserablism have gone through a litany of troubles, including poverty, drug withdrawal, prison time and an apocalyptic natural disaster. After listening to the punkified scorcher of an opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Agitation! Propaganda!,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you would never have guessed.\n\nYou might find it strange to see a word like Ã¢â‚¬Å“funÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ anywhere near the vicinity of this New Orleans quintet, but EyehategodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-awaited self-titled record is certainly enlivened and rejuvenated. They are no less dour than on previous outings, but now they spew their piss-and-vinegar nihilism with health, vigor and confidence, and it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just due to Billy AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thick, beefy production. The boys are back in town, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got some rock-solid songs and a rollicking, airtight performance to show for it.\n\nEyehategod has traditionally opted to open their records with some of their sloggiest material Ã¢â‚¬â€œ take Ã¢â‚¬Å“BlankÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Name is God (I Hate You),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for example Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but Ã¢â‚¬Å“Agitation! Propaganda!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ earns its exclamation points by cutting right through the hazy murk with a furious dose of sludgy hardcore punk. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perhaps the most immediate moment of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not a note is wasted and neither a moment hesitated in its two and a half minutes.\n\nThis newfound immediacy even characterizes slower cuts like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Parish Motel SicknessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Robitussin and Rejection.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They trudge to be sure, but lost is the sloppy sickliness of their classic material, supplanting it with a tight, rehearsed performance. Ã¢â‚¬Å“RobitussinÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ flaunts their trademark knotted chromatic riffs, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly a messy stupor. Tighter still are cuts such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Worthless RescueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nobody Told Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with the latter coming so close to straight-up blues rock at about 2:24 that one might momentarily forget that this is, in fact, the same five guys who penned some of the most harrowing expressions of real-life pain ever to come out of the extreme metal underground.\n\nAs if making up for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unusual exuberancy, frontman Mike Williams waxes vitriolic with his inimitable snarl, sounding far less haggard and breathless than on previous records. The lyrics are predictably swallowed up in the chaos, but on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flags and Cities Bound,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we are treated to perhaps EyehategodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only moment of lyrical intelligibility in the form of a disorienting spoken-word piece. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In this place of probation,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Williams seethes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“reading the label of a lead-based paint remover is considered highbrow literature.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ His blunt gutter poetry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ evidently culled from experience Ã¢â‚¬â€œ careens into the obtuse later on, but the imagery is concrete, evocative and disturbing when draped against the backdrop of EyehategodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic wailing amp feedback, and certainly a breath of fresh air when paired against the cookie-cutter throwaways that metal lyrics often are.\n\nAll of this praise serves greatly to underline the tragedy of Joey LaCazeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passing late last year. LaCazeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s was always EyehategodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beating heart, and at no point in their career is this more apparent than on this record. His tight, arhythmic swing absolutely dominates the groovier tracks like the aforementioned Ã¢â‚¬Å“QuitterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½s OffensiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and particularly the rock-solid Ã¢â‚¬Å“Worthless Rescue,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ wrangling in the rest of the band without resorting to obnoxious flashiness. LaCaze left behind his proudest moment on this record, and his clear enthusiasm behind the kit makes the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comeback bittersweet.\n\nNonetheless, Eyehategod is hardly the gamechanger that Take As Needed For Pain or Dopesick were, and there certainly arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t songs quite on par with the likes of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dixie WhiskeyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Southern Discomfort.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Instead, Eyehategod is an earnest record by a band evidently comfortable in its own skin. The band was not without its scars even without the passing of LaCaze, but this record is proof enough that tribulation only makes Eyehategod stronger.\n\n\nIf you like this torrent show some gratitude to site and please make a donation.
