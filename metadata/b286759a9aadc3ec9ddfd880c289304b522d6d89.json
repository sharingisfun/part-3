Please seed.\n\nEnjoy, \n\n\nTSV.\n\n\nBlackadder is the name that encompassed four series of a BBC1 historical sitcom, along with several one-off instalments. All television programme episodes starred Rowan Atkinson as anti-hero Edmund Blackadder and Tony Robinson as Blackadder's dogsbody, Baldrick. Each series was set in a different historical period with the two protagonists accompanied by different characters, though several reappear in one series or another, for example Melchett and Lord Flashheart.\n\nThe first series was written by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, while subsequent episodes were written by Curtis and Ben Elton. The shows were produced by John Lloyd. In 2000 the fourth series, Blackadder Goes Forth, ranked at 16 in the &quot;100 Greatest British Television Programmes&quot;, a list created by the British Film Institute. Also in the 2004 TV poll to find &quot;Britain's Best Sitcom&quot;, Blackadder was voted the second-best British sitcom of all time, topped by Only Fools and Horses. It was also ranked as the 20th-best TV show of all time by Empire magazine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b286759a9aadc3ec9ddfd880c289304b522d6d89","amp;dn":"Blackadder+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4+%2B+Extras+DVDRip+TSV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b286759a9aadc3ec9ddfd880c289304b522d6d89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,134,117,154,154,173,195,236,157,223,216,128,194,137,48,75,82,45,109,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
