In Macedonia, during war in Bosnia, Christians hunt an ethnic Albanian girl who may have murdered one of their own. A young monk who's taken a vow of silence offers her protection. In London, a photographic editor who's pregnant needs to talk it out with her estranged husband and chooses a toney restaurant. She wants permanence with her lover, a prize-winning Macedonian photographer just back from Bosnia, changed by the violence. He leaves abruptly for his village; he's not visited it in 16 years. There he tries to ignore bitter divisions between his Orthodox brethren and local Albanians, then tries to transcend them.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72635822f9908fcd3a9980f32b27b6120f81f244","amp;dn":"Before.The.Rain.%5B1994%5D.DVDRip.XviD-BLiTZKRiEG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72635822f9908fcd3a9980f32b27b6120f81f244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,99,88,34,249,144,143,205,58,153,128,243,43,39,182,18,15,129,242,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
