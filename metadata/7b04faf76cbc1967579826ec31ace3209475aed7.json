A devastating virus has ravaged the population, killing over 7 billion people. Those who have survived are either hiding underground or fighting each other for the few resources that can still be found.\r\n\r\nRealizing that humanity's only chance to survive is to stop the epidemic before it begins, a small group of scientists attempts to pinpoint the plague's origin through fragments of old media. Then, making use of a somewhat imprecise time-travel technology that was being developed before the outbreak, they send convict James Cole more than 25 years into the past to stop the infection from being unleashed upon the world.\r\n\r\n[Media]: video/H264\r\n[Format]: x264\r\n[Resolution]: 720x404 px\r\n[AspectRatio]: 16:9\r\n[FrameRate]: 23.976 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b04faf76cbc1967579826ec31ace3209475aed7","amp;dn":"12+Monkeys+Season+1+-+2+Complete+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b04faf76cbc1967579826ec31ace3209475aed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,4,250,247,108,188,25,103,87,152,38,236,49,172,227,32,148,117,174,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
