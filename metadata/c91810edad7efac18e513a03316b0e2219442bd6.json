In fact, cutting-edge science supports a radically different approach to weight loss and health, proving that by focusing on food and exercise qualityÃ¢â‚¬â€rather than calorie quantityÃ¢â‚¬â€you can burn fat and boost health more easily and enjoyably that you ever thought possible.\n\nThe human body does not recognize all calories as equal. Some foods are used to repair tissue, boost brain power, and fuel our metabolismÃ¢â‚¬â€while others are stored as fat. In The Calorie Myth, Bailor shows us how eating more of the right kinds of foods and exercising less, but at a higher intensity, is the true formula for burning fat.\n\nWhy? Because eating high-quality foodsÃ¢â‚¬â€like whole plants and nutritious proteinsÃ¢â‚¬â€balances the hormones that regulate our metabolism. When we eat these foods, our bodies naturally maintain a healthy weight. But when we eat sugar, starches, processed fats, and other poor quality foods, the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regulatory system becomes &quot;clogged&quot; and prevents us from burning extra calories. Translation: Those extra 10 pounds aren't the result of eating too much . . . they're the result from eating the wrong foods.\n\nIn The Calorie Myth, Bailor offers clear, comprehensive guidance on what to eat and why, providing an eating plan, recipes, and a simple yet effective exercise regimen based on the principles of high intensity interval training. Losing weight doesn't have to mean going hungry or spending hours at the gym. The Calorie Myth offers a radical new model for weight loss and long-term health.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c91810edad7efac18e513a03316b0e2219442bd6","amp;dn":"The+Calorie+Myth-+How+to+Eat+More%2C+Exercise+Less%2C+Lose+Weight+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c91810edad7efac18e513a03316b0e2219442bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,24,16,237,173,126,250,193,142,81,58,3,49,107,14,34,25,68,43,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
