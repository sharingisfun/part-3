Keith Melton offer an unprecedented look at the CIA's most secretive operations and the devices that made them possible. Against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions- including the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the current War on Terror-the authors show how the CIA carries out its missions employing amazingly inventive tools. Illustrated with images never before seen by the public-and featuring everything from micro cameras to wired kitties to exploding pancakes-Spycraft is both a fantastic encyclopedia of gadgetry and a revealing primer on the fundamentals of high-tech espionage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b881032b0136cf62f7368aad03b69f6a107fbb","amp;dn":"Spycraft+The+Secret+History+of+the+CIA%27s++by+Robert+Wallace%2C+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b881032b0136cf62f7368aad03b69f6a107fbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,184,129,3,43,1,54,207,98,247,54,138,173,3,182,159,106,16,127,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
