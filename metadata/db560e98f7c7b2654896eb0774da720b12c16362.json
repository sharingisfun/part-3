This is their problem and their loss alike. &quot;The Crystal Method: Vegas&quot; is one of the best CD's relaesed by any artist, of any kind of music in a long time. usually you get 2, maybe 3 songs worth listening to on a CD.I like every song from track (1) &quot;Trip Like I Do to (10) &quot;Bad Stone&quot;. It's good, addictive music. You can listen to it, no matter what mood you're in. Busy Child is the only song I no longer listen to anymore. MTV's exploitation on the original &quot;AMP&quot; and the use of it in a GAP commercial ruined it for me. It's still a good song regardless. If you don't like techno, but you haven't heard much, this is the CD to listen to if you want to give it a chance. I recommend it to everyone. \n\n\n\n320 bit rate MP3\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n 1    &quot;Trip Like I Do&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:34\n 2    &quot;Busy Child&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:25\n 3    &quot;Cherry Twist&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25\n 4    &quot;High Roller&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:29\n          Includes a short hidden track that continues into the 10-second pregap.\n 5    &quot;Comin' Back&quot; (Ken Jordan, Scott Kirkland and Trixie Reiss) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:39\n 6    &quot;Keep Hope Alive&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:12\n 7    &quot;Vapor Trail&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:31\n 8    &quot;She's My Pusher&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:41\n 9    &quot;Jaded&quot; (Jordan, Kirkland and Reiss) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:05\n10    &quot;Bad Stone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:09\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db560e98f7c7b2654896eb0774da720b12c16362","amp;dn":"The+Crystal+Method+-+Vegas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db560e98f7c7b2654896eb0774da720b12c16362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,86,14,152,247,199,178,101,72,150,235,7,116,218,114,11,18,193,99,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
