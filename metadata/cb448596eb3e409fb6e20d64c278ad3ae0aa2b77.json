Rooted in a gospel tradition that was to inform her soul-charged sound, her impact on pop music, and in particular American pop music was profound. It was the run of late-60s Atlantic hits featured here (&quot;Respect&quot;, &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;, &quot;I Say A Little Prayer&quot;) that made her a star but as this &quot;best of&quot; shows, there was plenty more to come. Aretha was discovered all over again by a new generation in the 80s thanks to her role and performance (&quot;Think&quot;) in hit musical The Blues Brothers. Riding high on a wave of success, duets with latter day icons followed like the epic &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting&quot; with stubble-faced George Michael and the anthemic &quot;Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves&quot; with self-proclaimed diva Annie Lennox. Respect is certainly due to the remarkable talent of Aretha Franklin and this double disc anthology thoroughly represents the diva in her full majesty. 'Respect: The Very Best Of Aretha Franklin' is a 2CD set featuring a collection of her hits and most well known songs which span over forty years in the music industry.&quot; \n\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nRespect: The Very Best Of Aretha Franklin\n=========================================\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
