From the covert PR used to start the first Gulf War to the neuromarketing of products to appeal to our unconscious minds, he reveals the dark arts practised by professional persuaders.\r\n\r\nHow did we end up with a world where beliefs are mass-produced by lobbyists and PR firms? Could Google orswing elections? Are new kinds of persuasion making us less likely to live happy, decent lives in an open, peaceful world? Is it too late, or can we learn to listen to reason again? The Persuaders is a call to think again about how we think now","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:160e55dc5d70e8837539faf9ceab98853bde9afd","amp;dn":"The+Persuaders%3A+The+hidden+industry+%282016%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"160e55dc5d70e8837539faf9ceab98853bde9afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,14,85,220,93,112,232,131,117,57,250,249,206,171,152,133,59,222,154,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
