The authors aim to present corporate finance as the working of a small number of integrated and powerful intuitions, rather than a collection of unrelated topics. They develop the central concepts of modern finance: arbitrage, net present value, efficient markets, agency theory, options, and the trade-off between risk and return, and use them to explain corporate finance with a balance of theory and application.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPART I: Overview\n1 Introduction to Corporate Finance\n2 Financial Statements and Cash Flow\n3 Financial Statements Analysis and Financial Models\n\nPART II: Valuation and Capital Budgeting\n4 Discounted Cash Flow Valuation\n5 Net Present Value and Other Investment Rules\n6 Making Capital Investment Decisions\n7 Risk Analysis, Real Options, and Capital Budgeting\n8 Interest Rates and Bond Valuation\n9 Stock Valuation\n\nPART III: Risk\n10 Risk and Return: Lessons from Market History\n11 Return and Risk: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n12 An Alternative View of Risk and Return: The Arbitrage Pricing Theory\n13 Risk, Cost of Capital, and Valuation\n\nPART IV: Capital Structure and Dividend Policy\n14 Efficient Capital Markets and Behavioral Challenges\n15 Long-Term Financing: An Introduction\n16 Capital Structure: Basic Concepts\n17 Capital Structure: Limits to the Use of Debt\n18 Valuation and Capital Budgeting for the Levered Firm\n19 Dividends and Other Payouts\n\nPART V: Long Term Financing\n20 Raising Capital\n21 Leasing\n\nPART VI: Options, Futures, and Corporate Finance\n22 Options and Corporate Finance\n23 Options and Corporate Finance: Extension and Applications\n24 Warrants and Convertibles\n25 Derivatives and Hedging Risk\n\nPART VII: Short-Term Finance\n26 Short-Term Finance and Planning\n27 Cash Management\n28 Credit and Inventory Management\n\nPART VIII: Special Topics\n29 Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures\n30 Financial Distress\n31 International Corporate Finance\nAppendix A: Mathematical Tables \nAppendix B: Solutions to Selected End-of-Chapter Problems\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\nSTEPHEN A.
