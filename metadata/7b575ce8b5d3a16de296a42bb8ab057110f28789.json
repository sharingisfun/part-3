Starting with the changes that restructured Europe and her colonies following the First World War, Gerhard Weinberg sheds new light on every aspect of World War II. Actions of the Axis, the Allies, and the Neutrals are covered in every theater of the war. More importantly, the global nature of the war is examined, with new insights into how events in one corner of the world helped affect events in other distant parts. In a new edition, with a new preface, A World at Arms remains a classic of global history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b575ce8b5d3a16de296a42bb8ab057110f28789","amp;dn":"A+World+at+Arms%3A+A+Global+History+of+World+War+II+%282005%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b575ce8b5d3a16de296a42bb8ab057110f28789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,87,92,232,181,211,161,109,226,150,164,43,184,171,5,113,16,242,135,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
