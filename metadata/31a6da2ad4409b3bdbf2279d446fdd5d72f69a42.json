ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect potluck fare, such as the simple, warming, and intensely flavored Collard Greens and Cabbage with Lots of Garlic, and the Caribbean-inspired Cocoa Spice  Cake with Crystallized Ginger and Coconut-Chocolate Ganache, plus a refreshing Roselle-Rooibos Drink that will satisfy any sweet tooth. \nWith more than 100 modern and delicious dishes that draw on TerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal memories as well as the history of food that has traveled from the African continent, Afro-Vegan takes you on an international food journey.
