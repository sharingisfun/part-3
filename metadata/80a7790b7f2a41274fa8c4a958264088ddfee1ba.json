Personally, I still believe that the 1998 version is the better in that it has much warmth and the chemistry between Tess and Angel is something to behold. However, this version does have the benefit of an extra hour (4 hours as opposed to 3) and this means than more of Hardy's text can be explored.\n\nIn short watch this and also the Justine Waddell version. They both deserve a viewing.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80a7790b7f2a41274fa8c4a958264088ddfee1ba","amp;dn":"Thomas+Hardy+-+Tess+of+the+D%5C%27urbervilles++%28BBC+2008+-+Part+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80a7790b7f2a41274fa8c4a958264088ddfee1ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,167,121,11,127,42,65,39,79,168,196,169,88,38,64,136,221,254,225,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
