It is the ocean of faults. But there is a very nice thing, asti hy eko mahan gunah, a very great quality. What is that? Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet [SB 12.3.51]. If you simply chant Hare Krishna mantra, then you become perfect. Is it very difficult? Chant Hare Krishna and you become perfect. But we are so unfortunate, we are not even prepared to chant. This is our position. So you have to make little determination that Ã¢â‚¬ËœI shall chant henceforward Hare Krishna mantra.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Then everything is all right.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Srila Prabhupada from Lecture)\n\n&quot;In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting of the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.&quot; Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one advances perfectly in spiritual life. This is the best process for success in life. In other ages, the chanting of the holy name is equally powerful, but especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is most powerful. Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet: simply by chanting the holy name of Krsna, one is liberated and returns home, back to Godhead. Therefore, even if one is able to perform other processes of devotional service, one must adopt the chanting of the holy name as the principal method of advancing in spiritual life. Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who are very sharp in their intelligence should adopt this process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. One should not, however, manufacture different types of chanting. One should adhere seriously to the chanting of the holy name as recommended in the scriptures: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.\n\nEach yuga is an age with specific characteristics in which incarnations of Krsna appear. The four yugas make up a cycle called divya-yuga, which lasts 4,320,000 years. One thousand of these yugas equal one day of Brahma, which is called a kalpa. Brahma's lifespan is 100 years of his time. In each yuga there is a specific process of self-realization (yuga dharma).\n\nSATYA YUGA - (sometimes also called krta-yuga): the golden age lasts 1,728,000 years. The process of self-realization in this yuga is meditation on Visnu. During this yuga the majority of the population is situated in the mode of goodness and the average life span at the beginning of the yuga is 100,000 years.\n\nTRETA YUGA - also called the silver age, lasts 1,296,000 years and the process of self realization is the performance of opulent yajnas(sacrifices). The average life span is 10,000 years and the godly qualities decrease one fourth compared to the Satya yuga.\nIt is during this age that Varna-asrama-dharma is introduced.\n\nDVAPARA YUGA - or the bronze age, lasts 864,000 years and the process of self realization is the worship of the deities within temples. Godly qualities are reduced to 50% by now and the average life expectancy is only 1000 years.\n\nKALI YUGA - the iron age of hypocrisy and quarrel lasts 432,000 years. Lord Krsna appeared in His original, trancendental form right before the beginning of Kali Yuga. The process of self realization is sankirtana, the chanting of the Holy Names of the Lord. God consciousness is reduced to 25% of the population and life expectancy is only 100 years. By now already 5000 years of Kali yuga have passed and it is predicted that by the end of the yuga people will hardly be older than 20 years and their only food will be meat.\n\nThe yuga cycles are constantly changing and the phases between them are called yuga sandhyas.\n\n\nThus Mohammed counseled, &quot;Glorify the name of your Lord, the most high&quot;[Koran: 87.2]\n\nSaint Paul said, &quot;Everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved&quot; [Romans: 10.13]\n\nLord Buddha declared,&quot;All who sincerely call upon My name will come to me after death, and I will take them to Paradise&quot;[Vows of Amida Buddha]\n\nKing David preached, &quot;From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the Lord is to be praised&quot; [Psalms:113.3].\n\nAnd the world's oldest scriptures, the Vedas of India, emphatically state,&quot;Chant the holy name, chant the holy name of the Lord. In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy there is no other way, there is no other way, no other way to attain spiritual enlightenement.&quot; [Brhadnaradiya Purana].\n\n&quot;After searching through all the Vedic literature one cannot find a method of religion more sublime for this age than the chanting of Hare KÃ¡Â¹â€ºÃ¡Â¹Â£Ã¡Â¹â€¡a.&quot;\n\nSource - http://www.vedaveda.com/prabhupadaroom/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=75%3Athe-prime-religion-practice-for-the-kali-yuga-is-the-chanting-of-the-holy-name&amp;catid=50%3Ale-nectar-du-saint-nom&amp;lang=fr\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.harekrsna.com/practice/process/kirtanam/kirtanam.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.harekrsna.com/practice/process/kirtanam/kirtanam.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:958f4da9dccff6ba42ce0a5337061481ccdf305c","amp;dn":"Best+of+Hare+Krishna+Mantra+%26amp%3B+Kirtans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"958f4da9dccff6ba42ce0a5337061481ccdf305c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,143,77,169,220,207,246,186,66,206,10,83,55,6,20,129,204,223,48,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
