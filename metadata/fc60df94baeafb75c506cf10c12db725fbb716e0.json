When Sheriff Walt Longmire and his good friend Henry Standing Bear are called to Hulett, Wyomingâ€”the nearest town to Americaâ€™s first national monument, Devils Towerâ€”to investigate, things start getting complicated. As competing biker gangs; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; a military-grade vehicle donated to the tiny local police force by a\r\nwealthy entrepreneur; and Lola, the real-life femme fatale and namesake for Henryâ€™s â€™59 Thunderbird (and, by extension, Waltâ€™s granddaughter) come into play, it rapidly becomes clear that there is more to get to the bottom of at this yearâ€™s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally than a bike accident. After all, in the words of Arthur Conan Doyle, whose Adventures of Sherlock Holmes the Bear wonâ€™t stop quoting, â€œThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.â€\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc60df94baeafb75c506cf10c12db725fbb716e0","amp;dn":"An+Obvious+Fact+-+Craig+Johnson+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc60df94baeafb75c506cf10c12db725fbb716e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,96,223,148,186,234,251,117,197,6,207,16,193,45,183,37,251,183,22,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
