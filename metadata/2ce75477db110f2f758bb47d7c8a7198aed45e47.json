Every major hit by the trio is represented here in its full-length glory. The order of songs is perfect for a party; for example, the first cut (&quot;Early in the Morning&quot; with its trademark &quot;rooster call&quot;) starts the disc off and is followed by the mid-tempo &quot;Shake&quot; and the slower paced &quot;Outstanding&quot;. \nThe fire starts again as &quot;Burn Rubber On Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)&quot; ignites the set and leads into the soothing &quot;Yearning for Your Love&quot;. The chart-topping &quot;You Dropped A Bomb on Me&quot; and &quot;I Don&amp;#039;t Believe You Want to Get Up and Dance (Oops!)&quot; are two other classics that remind the listener of why these guys ruled the dance floors during the decade.\nAlong with Cameo, Parliament/Funkadelic, The Gap Band was the best at what they did: got folks and on the dance floor and kept them there! \n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦This is a Must.\n\n\n\n\n01.
