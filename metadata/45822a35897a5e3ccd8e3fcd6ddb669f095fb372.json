Gleason Music Book Award&quot;, Standing in The Shadows of Motown  was shot in 35mm film, on location in Detroit and elsewhere. This one hour and forty-eight minute documentary and performance film tells the Funk Brothers' saga through archival footage and still photos, narration, interviews, re-creation scenes, 20 Motown master tracks, and twelve new live performances of Motown classics with the Funk Brothers backing up Chaka Khan, Ben Harper, Bootsy Collins, Montell Jordan, Meshell Ndegeocello, Joan Osborne, and Gerald Levert.\n\n\nIn 1959, Berry Gordy gathered the best musicians from Detroit's thriving jazz and blues scene to begin cutting songs for his new record company. Over a fourteen year period they were the heartbeat on &quot;My Girl,&quot; &quot;Bernadette,&quot; I Was Made to Love Her,&quot; and every other hit from Motown's Detroit era.\n\nBy the end of their phenomenal run, this unheralded group of musicians had played on more number ones hits than the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, Elvis and the Beatles combined - which makes them the greatest hit machine in the history of popular music. They called themselves the Funk Brothers.\n\nForty-one years after they played their first note an a Motown record and three decades since they were all together, the Funk Brothers reunited back in Detroit to play their music and tell their unforgettable story \n\nWith the tumultuous sixties as a backdrop, Motown's unsung heroes take the viewer on a compelling journey in time as they trace the evolution of The Motown Sound&quot; from its origins in Detroit to its demise in Los Angeles during the seventies. Through the eyes of the riveting characters who ruled Hitsville's studio by day and the club scene of Detroit by night, we enter a world of unparalleled soul and emotion as the Funk Brothers revisit the sites of their musical roots, triumphs, and eventual heartbreak.\n\nFor more than four decades, from the dance floors of the world, to the Detroit riots of 1967, to the war in Vietnam, the music the Funk Brothers created has played a major role in the cultural fabric of all of our lives. STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN finally puts some faces on that music and introduces these heroic musical figures to the world. \n\n\nTrack Listing: Starring The Funk Brothers \n1 (Love Is Like A) Heat Wave - Joan Osborne\n2 YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Really Got A Hold On Me - Meshell Ndegeocello \n3 Do You Love Me - Bootsy Collins\n4 Bernadette (instrumental) - The Funk Brothers\n5 Reach Out IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Be There - Gerald Levert\n6 AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Too Proud To Beg - Ben Harper\n7 Shotgun - Gerald Levert featuring Tom Scott\n8 What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted - Joan Osborne\n9 I Heard It Through The Grapevine - Ben Harper\n10 You Keep Me Hanging On (instrumental) - The Funk Brothers \n11 Cool Jerk - Bootsy Collins\n12 Cloud Nine - Meshell Ndegeocello\n13 WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Going On - Chaka Khan\n14 Band Introduction / AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t No Mountain High Enough - Chaka Khan &amp; Montell Jordan\n15  The Flick - Earl Van Dyke\n\n\n\nArtists featured on the soundtrack\nJoan Osborne\nMeshell Ndegeocello\nBootsy Collins\nGerald Levert\nBen Harper\nGerald Levert\nChaka Khan\nMontell Jordan\nOriginal Funk Brothers:\nJoe Messina ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\nEddie Willis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\nJoe Hunter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keyboards\nJohnny Griffith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keyboards\nBob Babbitt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass\nRichard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPistolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Allen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums\nUriel Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums\nJack Ashford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vibes and Percussion \n\nDeparted Funk Brothers There In Spirit:\nRobert White ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\nEarl Van Dyke ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keyboards\nJames Jamerson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass\nBenny ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPapa ZitaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Benjamin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums\nEddie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBongoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Brown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Congas\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : F:\\MUSIC UP\\Standing In The Shadows of Motown(musicin The Shadows.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 701 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 43mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 949 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n[b]Video[/b]\nID                               : 0\nFormat                               : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP    : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel       : No\nFormat settings, GMC      : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix    : Custom\nCodec ID                     : XVID\nDuration                      : 1h 43mn\nBit rate                         : 828 Kbps\nWidth  x  Height          : 496 x 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio     : 16:9\nFrame rate                    : 25.000 fps\nColor space                   : YUV\nChroma subsampling    : 4:2:0\nBit depth                       : 8 bits\nScan type                      : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)        : 0.232\nStream size                    : 612 MiB (87%)\nWriting library               : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\nAudio\nID                : 1\nFormat        : MPEG Audio Version 1 Layer 3\nMode          : Joint stereo\nMode extension             : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                       : Mp3 55\nDuration                         : 1h 43mn\nBit rate                           : 108 Kbps Variable\nChannel(s)                      : 2 channels\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 79.5 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration          : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 545 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45822a35897a5e3ccd8e3fcd6ddb669f095fb372","amp;dn":"Standing+In+The+Shadows+of+Motown%28music+doc%29%28avi%29%5Brogercc%5D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45822a35897a5e3ccd8e3fcd6ddb669f095fb372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,130,42,53,137,122,94,60,205,142,63,205,109,219,102,159,9,95,179,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
