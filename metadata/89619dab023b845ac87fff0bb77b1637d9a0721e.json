The members of the group were Scott Engel on lead vocals and bass guitar, John Maus on guitar and vocals, and drummer Gary Leeds. They came together in Los Angeles in 1964 and formed the group. While their biggest hits were covers of songs by American pop songwriting teams like Bacharach-David and Mann-Weil, Scott (and occasionally John Walker) could write brooding originals in a more personal, less overblown style when given the chance. Their most successful period was in the mid to late '60s, although these '70s albums are equally impressive.
