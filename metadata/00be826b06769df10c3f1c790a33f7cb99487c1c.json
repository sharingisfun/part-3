The band achieved its greatest success in the 1980s with its arena rock sound, which garnered many charting singles, especially in the United States. The band is best known for its double platinum-certified 1982 hit &quot;Eye of the Tiger,&quot; the theme song for the motion picture Rocky III (US #1 for 6 weeks). Singles like &quot;Burning Heart&quot; (US #2), &quot;The Search Is Over&quot; (US #4), &quot;High on You&quot; (US #8), &quot;Is This Love&quot; (US #9) and &quot;I Can't Hold Back&quot; (US #13) continued to chart in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe band tweaked its musical direction in 1988 with the release of the slightly heavier &quot;Too Hot to Sleep&quot;, but the album barely reached the Billboard 200 in the United States. Because of this, the band split. Singer Jimi Jamison later toured as 'Survivor' in the mid-1990s, to the chagrin of the rest of the band. Jamison reunited with the band's other members in 2000 and the band released Reach in 2006, but Jamison left the band after its release and was replaced by Robin McAuley. The band continued to tour with McAuley into 2011.\n\nAn announcement on November 13, 2011 by Robin McAuley on his Facebook page revealed that he had left Survivor. A subsequent announcement on November 18, 2011 confirmed that Jimi Jamison had rejoined the band, and a tour was to take place in 2012.\n\nIn April of 2013, it was announced on the band's official media sources that guitarist Frankie Sullivan has reunited the current Survivor line-up with singer Dave Bickler, with the band now having their two vocalists together for the next tour, Dave Bickler and Jimi Jamison. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00be826b06769df10c3f1c790a33f7cb99487c1c","amp;dn":"Survivor+-+Ultimate+Survivor+%5B2004%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00be826b06769df10c3f1c790a33f7cb99487c1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,190,130,107,6,118,157,241,12,63,28,121,10,51,247,203,153,72,124,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
