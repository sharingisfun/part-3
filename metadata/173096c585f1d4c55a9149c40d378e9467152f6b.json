Shattering decades of dogma, scientists began publishing studies in 2008 showing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“fluid intelligenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€the ability to learn, solve novel problems, and get to the heart of thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€can be increased through training.\n\nBut is it all just hype? With vivid stories of lives transformed, science journalist Dan Hurley delivers practical findings for people of every age and ability. Along the way, he narrates with acidtongued wit his experiences as a human guinea pig, road-testing commercial brain-training programs, learning to play the Renaissance lute, getting physically fit, even undergoing transcranial directcurrent stimulation.\n\nSmarter speaks to the audience that made bestsellers out of Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain and Moonwalking with Einstein.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:173096c585f1d4c55a9149c40d378e9467152f6b","amp;dn":"Smarter+-+The+New+Science+of+Building+Brain+Power+-+Dan+Hurley+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"173096c585f1d4c55a9149c40d378e9467152f6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,48,150,197,133,241,212,197,90,145,73,196,13,55,142,148,103,21,47,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
