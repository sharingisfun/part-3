We assume the reader has some familiarity with\ngroups, rings, and Ã‚Â¯elds, and for Chapter 7 some programming experience.\nThis book grew out of an undergraduate course that the author taught at\nHarvard University in 2001 and 2002.\n\n\nNotation and Conventions. We let N = f1; 2; 3; : : :g denote the natural\nnumbers, and use the standard notation Z, Q, R, and C for the rings of\ninteger, rational, real, and complex numbers, respectively. In this book we\nwill use the words proposition, theorem, lemma, and corollary as follows.\nUsually a proposition is a less important or less fundamental assertion, a\ntheorem a deeper culmination of ideas, a lemma something that we will\nuse later in this book to prove a proposition or theorem, and a corollary\nan easy consequence of a proposition, theorem, or lemma.\nAcknowledgements. Brian Conrad and Ken Ribet made a large number\nof clarifying comments and suggestions throughout the book. Baurzhan\nBektemirov, Lawrence Cabusora, and Keith Conrad read drafts of this book\nand made many comments. Frank Calegari used the course when teaching\nMath 124 at Harvard, and he and his students provided much feedback.\nNoam Elkies made comments and suggested Exercise 4.5. Seth Kleinerman\nwrote a version of Section 5.3 as a class project. Samit Dasgupta, George\nStephanides, Kevin Stern, and Heidi Williams all suggested corrections.
