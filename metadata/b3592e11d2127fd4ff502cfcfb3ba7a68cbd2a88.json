Memoirs Of A Murderer arrives everywhere on August 19th.\n\nMemoirs Of A Murderer is available now for pre-order at the iTunes Store, with exclusive bundles on offer at the Flint, Michigan-based band's own store.king810.com. All pre-orders will receive three instant grat album tracks, &quot;Killem All,&quot; &quot;desperate lovers,&quot; and &quot;Fat Around The Heart&quot; with additional tracks to be revealed in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the official companion video for &quot;Fat Around The Heart&quot; is making its debut today, exclusively at AltPress.com.\n\nKing 810 will spend its summer heralding Memoirs Of A Murderer on the 2014 Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival. The annual trek hits the road July 5th at San Bernardino, California's San Manuel Amphitheater and then travels through the summer. From there, King 810 will cross the Atlantic for a tour of the UK, slated to get underway in late September.\n\nMemoirs Of A Murderer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which follows the recently released prelude to the album, &quot;proem&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is a striking and important body of work from the newest members of the Roadrunner Records roster (see attached tracklisting). Told in three movements, &quot;Memoirs Of A Murderer&quot; is the embodiment of David Gunn's life within the pressure cooker of Flint, MI, fired by Gunn's brutally honest narratives and starkly poetic lyricism. Memoirs... sees Gunn confronting the violence that plagues the streets of Flint, perfectly capturing the despair that infects the lives of those who reside in the belly of the beast. Memoirs Of A Murderer is a remarkable journey through the post-millennial American wasteland, terrifying, tragic, and ultimately transcendent.\n\n01. Killem All\n02. Best Nite Of My Life\n03.
