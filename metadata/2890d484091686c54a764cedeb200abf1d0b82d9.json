VU meters are most useful for showing overall signal level, and peak meters (akin to the channel meters in the Studio One Console) are most useful for keeping track of peak signal levels. By referencing both of these, you can see a more nuanced picture of your signalÃ¢â‚¬â€overall level and peak level.\n\nA stereo correlation meter rounds out the trio, giving you insight into the left/right phase relationship of your signal.\n\nThis free standalone VU Meter plug-in is made from the same components used in the Channel Strip Collection.\n\nOne nice feature is that it offers pre fader metering. We also love the micro mode on each channel.\n\n\nFOR WIN/MAC\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n\nOnly works under R2R patched StudiOne release.\n\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Thats it! Done.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Supp0rt th3 D3v3lop3r if you liK3 it.\n\n3Nj0Y!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2890d484091686c54a764cedeb200abf1d0b82d9","amp;dn":"PreSonus+VU+Meter+v1.0.0.34268+for+StudioOne-R2R+%5Bdeepstatus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2890d484091686c54a764cedeb200abf1d0b82d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,144,212,132,9,22,134,197,74,118,76,237,235,32,10,191,29,11,130,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
