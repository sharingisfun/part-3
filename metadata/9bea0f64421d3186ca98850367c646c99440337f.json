So he did.\nHe gathered other developers around him, and eMule Project was born.\nTheir aim was to put the client back on track where eDonkey had been famous before, adding tons of new features and a nice GUI.\nThey couldn't imagine what impact this decision would have... \n\nAs of today, eMule is one of the biggest and most reliable peer-to-peer file sharing clients around the world. Thanks to it's open source policy many developers are able to contribute to the project, making the network more efficient with each release. \n\nWhat does eMule mean?\nThe name &quot;eMule&quot; comes from an animal called &quot;Mule&quot; which is somehow similar to a donkey ;) \n\nHow often is eMule updated?\neMule is not updated regularly, but at the moment the frequencies are between 1 and 3 months.\nDon't take this for guaranteed. :) \n\n\nA list of a few features available.\n\nClients use several networks to create one reliable network.\n(ED2K, Source Exchange, Kad) \n\nKad is now in an open testphase, eMule v0.42 can be enabled to use Kad \n\neMule's Queue and Credit system helps to ensure that everyone will get the file he wants by promoting those that upload back to the network. \n\neMule is completely free. eMule is also completely free of any Adware, Spyware, and ect. We do this for fun and knowledge, not for money. \n\nEach file checked for corruptions while downloading to ensure an error free file. \n\nThe eMules Intelligent Corruption Control helps to speed up the correction of corrupted parts. \n\nAuto priorities and Source management allows you to start many downloads without having to monitor them. \n\nThe Preview function allows you to look at your Videos and Archives before they are completed. For video previewing, we recommend the Video Lan Client. \n\nThe eMule features webservices and a webserver that allows you to have quick access to and from the internet. \n\nYou can create categories for your download to organize them. \n\nTo find the file you want, eMule offers a wide range of search possibilities which include: Servers (Local, and Global), web based (Jigle, and Filedonkey), and Kad (Still in Alpha). \n\neMule also allows you to use very complex Boolean searches that make the searches much more flexible. \n\nWith the messaging and friend system, you can send messages to other Clients and add them as friends. In your friend list, you can always see if a friend is online. \n\nWith the build in IRC client, you can chat with other downloaders and chatters around the globe.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nDear eMule users, \n\nit has been a long ride, but now we are finally halfway there  \nWe are once again happy to present you a new shiny version: eMule 0.50a. \nMany small but nonetheless important fixes and changes were made, but the main features of this new version are:\n\nMaking eMules file verifying algorithm future proof by combining the ed2k hash with the AICH hash to identify and verify downloaded parts and files. \nThis guarantuees that existing and newly found MD4 weaknesses will not affect eMules ability to deliver uncorrupted files in the future. \nSeveral GUI improvements, like supporting new taskbar features of Windows7, easier access to download commands by adding a new toolbar, an improved shared files dialog and a brand new Kad graph to look and wonder at\nBetter usability in small LANs by adjusting Kad to such an environment and supporting highspeed uploads\nAnd as always fixing bugs and adding other small changes\n\n\nFor all the details, check out the complete changelog below!\n\n\neMule 0.50a\n-----------------------\n- Apr, 5. 2010 -\n-----------------------\n.: Added preferences.ini-only option &quot;ExtraPreviewWithMenu&quot; (eMule section) which makes eMule put the &quot;Preview with&quot; command into the root context menu rather than into the preview menu (only applies to extended controls with multiple preview programs set)\n.: Added &quot;Open preferences.ini&quot; button to the extended options. \nRemember that you have to close eMule _before_ saving any changes if you want to edit any not preferences.ini-only settings\n.: AICH hashs work properly in all collection types now\n\n-----------------------\n- Apr, 2. 2010 -\n-----------------------\n.: Added new ed2k link type: &quot;ed2k://|search|[searchterm]|/&quot; makes eMule start a search for the specified searchterm.
