Like many, I was drawn to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Gulag OrkestarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ by its forbidding title, that anonymous and curiously haunting cover photo (allegedly found in a library, photographer unknown) and the Balkan-indie tag.\n\nAnd sure, it was a decent enough record, but something about it didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite connect. Then ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Flying Cup ClubÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ came along and again I tried, but felt that same sense of dislocation. Like the films of Wes Anderson, Zach CondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music can feel cool and isolating if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fully buy into it. But also like Anderson, when he snares you, he snares you goodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Rip TideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ has snared me more than all of CondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s previous records combined. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not quite his pop album, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly the one where he most expertly fuses his global influences with his now considerable song writing skills.\n\nSo, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“A CandleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ opens with his familiar mariachi stylings (and, incidentally, sounds exactly like music from The Terminator), itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s immediately followed by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Santa FeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, which demonstrates Condon at his most breezily charming. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a chance that it might be overlooked compared to some of the heavier songs that follow it. That would be a shame, as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actually perfect. The rest of the album is more subdued, but also more rewarding over the long haul. The title track unravels beautifully over a couple of plays and the whole album is fraught with an introspective intensity. Nowhere is that more obvious than on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GoshenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - the obvious highlight here. The key lyric, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re on in fiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, feels like a gentle encouragement - appropriate for a song that takes to the floor as a shy piano ballad, before blossoming into a multi-instrumental epic.\n\nThat this is both BeirutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deepest and most instantly enjoyable album is obvious. Condon has left the bedroom where he handcrafted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GulagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behind. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no longer a promising indie auteur, but the leader of a very good band. Yet, remarkably, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Rip TideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ retains the distinctiveness of those earlier records. Its quiet magnificence is destined to win over a lot of doubters.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da9447a8de2335a3a4a99ba7ae67c6261e03bbf3","amp;dn":"Beirut...The+Rip+Tide+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da9447a8de2335a3a4a99ba7ae67c6261e03bbf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,148,71,168,222,35,53,163,164,169,155,167,174,103,198,38,30,3,187,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
