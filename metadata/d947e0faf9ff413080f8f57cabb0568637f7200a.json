Its style, in accordance with its contents and aim is stern, grand - ever and always, truly sublime -\nSo, this book will go on exercising through all ages a most potent influence.&quot;\n- Goethe \n\n&quot;A totally objective examination of it [the Quran] in the light of modern knowledge leads us to recognize the agreement between the two, as has been already noted on repeated occasions. It makes us deem it quite unthinkable for a man of Muhammad's time to have been the author of such statements, on account of the state of knowledge in his day. \nSuch considerations are part of what gives the Qur'anic Revelation its unique place, and forces the impartial scientist to admit his inability to provide and explanation which calls solely upon materialistic reasoning.&quot;\n- Dr. Maurice Bucaille\n\nThe Yusuf Ali translation of the Qur'an has long been considered among the most precise and eloquent renderings of the holy book of Muslims into English. \nFirst of all, despite the attempt to make the translation as accurate as possible, one must be aware of the PROFOUND differences between Arabic language and the English language. Arabic is much more complex and has an unequalled myriad of gramattical and linguistic tools, and it is that that makes the Quran so powerful and moving to anyone who knows Arabic well. When the Quran is translated into English, the beauty of the language is lost, hence the title 'Meanings of the Holy Quran in English' instead of 'The Holy Quran in English'.\n\nSecond, the translation allows for some misunderstandings that the anti-Muslims use to justify their prejudices against Islam. \nSo it must be pointed out that in the Arabic language, you must read all the verses for a sentence to make sense, and this does not necessarily come through in English, thus allowing for those misunderstandings. \nSuch misunderstandings can be overcome by reading all the verses in a sura in order to understand the meaning. If something is unclear, consult a Muslim.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, for the non-Muslims reading the text, a very important piece of advice: read the Quran OBJECTIVELY, or dont bother reading it. Some people read the Quran to try and justify and hatered/misconception that they may have. If you read the Quran with this mindset, you might as well save yourself the trouble, and continue to believe whatever it is that you desparately want to believe. Otherwise, I am sure that you will have a lot to gain from reading the meanings of the Quran.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d947e0faf9ff413080f8f57cabb0568637f7200a","amp;dn":"The+Koran+%28The+Quran%29+-+Authenticated+English+Translation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d947e0faf9ff413080f8f57cabb0568637f7200a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,71,224,250,249,255,65,48,128,248,245,124,171,176,86,134,55,247,32,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
