For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight.&quot; Flight is indeed the metaphor that makes the story soar.\n \n \n \n Ultimately this is a fable about the importance of seeking a higher purpose in life, even if your flock, tribe, or neighborhood finds your ambition threatening. (At one point our beloved gull is even banished from his flock.) By not compromising his higher vision, Jonathan gets the ultimate payoff: transcendence.\n \n \n \n \n \n Ultimately, he learns the meaning of love and kindness. The dreamy seagull photographs by Russell Munson provide just the right illustrations--although the overall packaging does seem a bit dated (keep in mind that it was first published in 1970). Nonetheless, this is a spirituality classic, and an especially engaging parable for adolescents. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07cb51f6750ed74e26c42e908f8b4636820224a6","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Livingston+Seagull+-+Richard+Bach+%28epub%29+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07cb51f6750ed74e26c42e908f8b4636820224a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,203,81,246,117,14,215,78,38,196,46,144,143,139,70,54,130,2,36,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
