Among his early admirers were artists such as Robert Musil, Hermann Hesse, Stefan Zweig, Walter Benjamin and Franz Kafka.  Despite marginal early success in his literary career, the popularity of his work gradually diminished over the second and third decades of the 20th century.  He remained financially unstable and eventually suffered a nervous breakdown, spending the remainder of his life in sanatoriums and taking frequent long walks.\n\nWalser's work was only rediscovered in the 1970s and are today regarded as being among the most important writings of literary modernism.  He has exerted a considerable influence on various contemporary German writers, including Ror Wolf, Peter Handke, W. G. Sebald, Max Goldt, and Enrique Vila-Matas.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* BERLIN STORIES (New York Review Books Classics, 2012).
