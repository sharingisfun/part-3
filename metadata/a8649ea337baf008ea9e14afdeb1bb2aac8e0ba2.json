Originally developed as a Graphical User Interface for Panorama Tools (hence the name), PTGui now is a full featured photo stitching application. \n\n Use PTGui to stitch any number of photos into a panoramic image. Some benefits of PTGui, when compared to other stitching software: \n - PTGui can stitch multiple rows of images\n - Create 360 degree cylindrical panoramas, 'flat' partial panoramas and even spherical 360x180 degree panoramas\n - No need to keep the camera level: PTGui can stitch rotated and tilted images\n - Virtually unlimited output size: create Gigapixel panoramas from hundreds of images!\n - Layered output allows full control over the final stitched result\n - PTGui stitches most panoramas fully automatically, but at the same time provides full manual control over every single parameter. This enables stitching of 'difficult' scenes, where other programs fail.\n - Full 16 bit workflow for best image quality\n\n Info:\n\n-Unzip and run\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/3649/cmov.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/3649/cmov.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8649ea337baf008ea9e14afdeb1bb2aac8e0ba2","amp;dn":"PTGui+Pro+9.1.8+%5BPortable%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8649ea337baf008ea9e14afdeb1bb2aac8e0ba2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,100,158,163,55,186,240,8,234,158,20,175,222,177,187,42,172,142,11,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
