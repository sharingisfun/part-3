On this release (1952), we hear the legendary &quot;President of the saxophone&quot; in great company. One can&amp;#039;t get much more polished and refined than the Oscar Peterson Quartet (the album&amp;#039;s title is incorrect; we do not hear a trio on this recording).\n\nIndeed, Young is superbly accompanied by Peterson on piano, Barney Kessel on guitar, Ray Brown on bass, and J.C. Heard on drums. Highlights on WITH THE OSCAR PETERSON TRIO include the somber ballad version of &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot; and the lively &quot;Tea for Two.&quot; Finally, on &quot;(It Takes) Two to Tango&quot; we hear Young singing: a very rare treat. His bawdy improvised lyrics and carefree delivery are quite charming, as are the number of very funny outtakes from the session itself.\n\nPersonnel: \nLester Young (vocals, tenor saxophone)\nOscar Peterson (piano)\nBarney Kessel (guitar)\nRay Brown (bass)\nJ.
