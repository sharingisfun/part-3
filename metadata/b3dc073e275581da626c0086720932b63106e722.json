With such an impressive body of work behind them, the band is now free to write and record as the inspiration takes them and able to draw on their very own musical lexicon honed over 12 years of active duty and an enviable collection of vintage synthesizers, guitars, and assorted gadgets that grace Atlas, their very own state-of-the-art recording studio nestled in the leafy backstreets of northern Paris. Love 2 is the group's fifth studio album and, whilst being instantly recognisable as an Air record, sees the band exploring some new territories with the help of of L.A.-based drummer/percussionist Joey Waronker.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3dc073e275581da626c0086720932b63106e722","amp;dn":"Air+-+Love+2+%5Bmp3-256-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3dc073e275581da626c0086720932b63106e722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,220,7,62,39,85,129,218,98,108,0,134,114,9,50,182,49,6,231,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
