Your last hope: a legendary alien facility dug deep into the Feldspar Mountains...a massive Pit, built by the ancient Suul'ka.\nSword of the Stars: The Pit is a fun, fast, light-hearted turn-based RPG, where the tradition of Rogue and other old school dungeon-diving games meets the sci-fi Sword of the Stars universe, where the question to ask isn't &quot;Did you make it to the end?&quot; so much as &quot;How far did you make it into The Pit before the monsters got you?&quot;\nAncient alien underground complex is just as good a setting for a roguelike game as any other dungeon, so find out just how deep you can get in this modern Sci-Fi turn-based RPG.
