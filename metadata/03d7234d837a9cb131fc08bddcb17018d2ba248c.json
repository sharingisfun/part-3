So during the course of these lessons, you'll have a chance to learn about different aspects of Maya from several of our instructors here at Digital-Tutors.\n\nDigital-Tutors is the worlds largest resource for Autodesk training, and over the years, we've had the honor and the privilege of teaching some of the top artists and studios all around the world. And for the next several hours, we'll be giving you the most structured, well-rounded and easiest to follow Maya training that you'll be able to find anywhere.\n\nIn the first portion of this tutorial, we'll be getting you familiar with some of the vocabulary and foundational skills that you'll need in order to begin moving around and working in Maya. From there, we'll move into exploring some of the modeling features found in Maya, and we'll begin building the mech that will be our central project for the remainder of this course.\n\nWe'll take you through the entire process of adding textures and materials to the mech, adding animated movement and animation controls, adding dynamics and finally we'll learn how to add lights, shadows and output our final animated sequence. \n\nThis training is designed for new Maya users, so our goal is not to weigh you down with a lot of technical information. Instead, we want you to form some really good habits and workflows Ã¢â‚¬â€œ getting to see the entire start-to-finish pipeline for this project Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and by the end of this tutorial, we want you to be at a point where you can feel very comfortable using Maya.\n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction to Maya 2015\n\n2.Navigating the viewport\n\n3.Working with the Maya interface\n\n4.Creating Maya projects\n\n5.Working with scene files in Maya\n\n6.Viewport shading and selection modes\n\n7.Transforming objects in Maya\n\n8.Using component mode\n\n9.Using the Attribute Editor\n\n10.Grouping and parenting\n\n11.Using the Maya hotbox\n\n12.Writing a MEL script\n\n13.Creating custom shelves\n\n14.Modeling overview\n\n15.Adding image planes\n\n16.Creating a blank for the body\n\n17.Using Quad Draw to create the body\n\n18.Finishing the main body topology\n\n19.Cleaning up the main body\n\n20.Modeling the thrusters\n\n21.Adding edges for smoothing\n\n22.Adding tubes using curves\n\n23.Adding ribs to the tubes\n\n24.Modeling the shoulder guards\n\n25.Building the upper arm\n\n26.Beginning the lower arm\n\n27.Adding the extending gun\n\n28.Adding the claws\n\n29.Modeling the front detail on the body\n\n30.Modeling the underside of the body\n\n31.Building the upper leg\n\n32.Modeling the lower leg\n\n33.Adding the shield\n\n34.Hierarchy and model prep\n\n35.Materials and texturing overview\n\n36.Applying simple materials\n\n37.Using ramps to drive material channels\n\n38.Adding multiple materials to objects\n\n39.Working with procedural textures\n\n40.UV Basics\n\n41.Using Substance to add metal detail\n\n42.Using the Ramp Shader\n\n43.Adding file textures\n\n44.Adding a bump map\n\n45.Rigging overview\n\n46.Cleaning up our scene\n\n47.Building a control object for the mech's center-of-mass \n\n48.Finishing the mech's center-of-gravity control\n\n49.Rigging with Driven Keys\n\n50.Building your first joint chain\n\n51.Completing the setup of our initial joint chain\n\n52.Mirroring joints in Maya\n\n53.Connecting our leg joints to follow the mech's root\n\n54.Binding geometry\n\n55.Creating joint chains for the mech's arms\n\n56.Controlling the mech's arms\n\n57.Adding Inverse Kinematics to the limbs\n\n58.Limb controls\n\n59.Connecting attributes with the Connection Editor\n\n60.Controlling the mech's toes\n\n61.Wrapping up our foot controls\n\n62.Rigging the mech's weapon\n\n63.Finishing the initial setup process of the mech's weapons\n\n64.Controlling the guns\n\n65.Adding a global control\n\n66.Making our scene animator-friendly\n\n67.Animation overview\n\n68.How to create and edit keyframes in Maya\n\n69.Managing keyframes in the Graph Editor and cycling animation infinitely\n\n70.Working with Auto Key and creating simple expressions in the Graph Editor\n\n71.Working with expressions\n\n72.Path animation\n\n73.Starting on the mech's sequence\n\n74.Animating the mech's platform\n\n75.Blocking in the mech's performance\n\n76.Finalizing our blocking pass\n\n77.Working on the mech's polishing pass\n\n78.Finishing the mech's polishing pass\n\n79.Adding a shot camera\n\n80.Finalizing the shot and previewing animations in real-time with Playblasts\n\n81.Dynamics overview\n\n82.Key concepts of dynamics in Maya\n\n83.Emitting nParticles from a mesh\n\n84.Editing nParticle properties, using the correct space scale for particle simulations, and setting up collisions\n\n85.Finalizing our nParticle settings\n\n86.Shading nParticles\n\n87.Animating nParticle attributes\n\n88.Adding more particles to enhance our simulation\n\n89.Animating our new nParticle object\n\n90.Adding wind effects to nParticles and improving the quality of your simulation via the nucleus solver\n\n91.Finalizing our nParticle simulation and working with the nCache tools\n\n92.Rendering overview\n\n93.Understanding various light types\n\n94.Controlling light color and intensity\n\n95.Adjusting light decay and specular contribution\n\n96.Altering the Render Stats of Maya objects\n\n97.Using images to generate realistic lighting\n\n98.Adding secondary illumination sources to our scene\n\n99.Baking Substance textures for mental ray rendering\n\n100.Fine-tuning the rendered appearance of materials\n\n101.Fine-tuning the rendered appearance of particles\n\n102.Adding final quality adjustments to our render\n\n103.Preparing render settings for final output\n\n104.Rendering the final sequence from Maya","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d7234d837a9cb131fc08bddcb17018d2ba248c","amp;dn":"%5BDigital+Tutors%5D+Introduction+to+Maya+2015-KTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d7234d837a9cb131fc08bddcb17018d2ba248c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,215,35,77,131,122,156,177,49,252,8,189,220,177,112,24,210,186,36,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
