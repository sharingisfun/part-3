End-of-chapter  exercises help you practice what\nyouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned.\n\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll  gain  a strong  foundation  in  the language,  including  best\npractices for  testing, debugging,  code reuse, and  other development\ntips. This book  also shows you how to use  Python for applications in\nbusiness, science, and  the arts, using various Python  tools and open\nsource packages.\n\n- Learn simple data types, and basic math and text operations\n- Use data-wrangling techniques with PythonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built-in data structures\n- Explore Python code structure, including the use of functions\n- Write large programs in Python, with modules and packages\n- Dive into objects, classes, and other object-oriented features\n- Examine storage from flat files to relational databases and NoSQL\n- Use Python to build web clients, servers, APIs, and services\n- Manage system tasks such as programs, processes, and threads\n- Understand the basics of concurrency and network programming\n\n\nAuthor\n======\nBill Lubanovic has developed software with UNIX since 1977, GUIs since\n1981, databases since 1990, and the Web since 1993. At a startup named\nIntran in 1982,  he developed MetaForm -- one of  the first commercial\nGUIs  (before  the Mac  or  Windows),  on  one  of the  first  graphic\nworkstations. At  Northwest Airlines  in the early  1990s, he  wrote a\ngraphic yield management system that  generated millions of dollars in\nrevenue; got the company on the Internet; and wrote its first Internet\nmarketing  test. He  co-founded  an  ISP (Tela)  in  1994,  and a  web\ndevelopment  company  (Mad Scheme)  in  1999.  Recently, he  developed\ncore  services  and distributed  systems  with  a  remote team  for  a\nManhattan startup. Currently, he's  integrating OpenStack services for\na supercomputer  company. He  enjoys life in  the Sangre  de Sasquatch\nmountains of Minnesota with his  wonderful wife Mary, children Tom and\nKarin, and cats Inga, Chester, and Lucy.\n\nRef: http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/2909","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79759c05c0eb24db8f631841344cedc373c3f3b3","amp;dn":"Introducing+Python+-+Bill+Lubanovic+%282014%29+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79759c05c0eb24db8f631841344cedc373c3f3b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,117,156,5,192,235,36,219,143,99,24,65,52,76,237,195,115,195,243,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
