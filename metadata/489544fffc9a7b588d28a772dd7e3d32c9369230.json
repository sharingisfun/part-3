After leaving a local seminary at the age of 17, the young man started to get involved in popular music, dedicating his first composition, called &quot;Juliantla,&quot; to his native town. In 1977, JosÃƒÂ© Manuel Figueroa decided to call himself Joan Sebastian Ã¢â‚¬â€ paying tribute to San Sebastian, where he used to work. He embarked on a successful career, having the opportunity to play a role in the Latin series TÃƒÂº y Yo and receiving the title of King of Jaripeo. In 1999 the popular artist was diagnosed with cancer, but he didn't stop working. A year later, Secreto de Amor received awards for song and album of the year in the Regional/Mexican category.\n\n\n1. Hasta Que Amanezca\n2. Rumores (With Lisa Lopez)\n3. Sembrador De Amor\n4.
