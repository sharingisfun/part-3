In the late 1950s\nand early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford,\nand Sammy Davis, Jr. formed the Rat Pack, so-called after an earlier group of social\nfriends, the Holmby Hills Rat Pack centered on Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, of\nwhich Sinatra had been a member. (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group\nreferred to themselves as &quot;The Summit&quot; or &quot;The Clan&quot; and never as &quot;The Rat Pack&quot;,\nalthough this has remained their identity in popular imagination.) The men made films\ntogether, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential\n(through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President John F. Kennedy)\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\nDISC 1\n\n01 - Memories Are Made Of This [02:18]\n02 - That's Amore [03:07]\n03 - Sway [02:43]\n04 - I Don't Care If The Sun Don't Shine [01:56]\n05 - Once In Love With Amy [02:14]\n06 - You Belong To Me [03:03]\n07 - If [02:48]\n08 - In The Cool, Cool, Cool Of The Evening [03:01]\n09 - That Lucky Old Sun [03:01]\n10 - Kiss [02:23]\n11 - Vieni Su (Say You Love Me Too) [02:40]\n12 - My Own, My Only, My All [03:01]\n13 - I'll Always Love You (Day After Day) [02:34]\n14 - Night Train To Memphis [01:57]\n15 - Be Honest With Me [02:28]\n16 - Walkin' My Baby Back Home [02:55]\n17 - Bye, Bye Blackbird [03:05]\n18 - Just For Fun [02:47]\n19 - Dreamy Old England Moon [02:33]\n20 - Three Wishes [02:38]\n21 - I Still Get A Thrill (Thinking Of You) [02:37]\n22 - Absence Makes The Heart Grow (Fonder For Somebody Else)[02:59]\n23 - Baby, Obey Me [02:35]\n24 - Who's Sorry Now?
