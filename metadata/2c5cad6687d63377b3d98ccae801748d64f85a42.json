I had a mate once, many\nyears ago - little Cockney guy - and he&amp;#039;d been in the FFL.\nHe walked out the front door one morning, after telling his \nmissus that he was just nipping out for some cigarettes, and\nhe didn&amp;#039;t come back for another seven years.   Weird or what.\nHe&amp;#039;d been in - not sure - think it was Kolwezi, Zaire...\nsomething like that.   Anyway, enjoy the album.
