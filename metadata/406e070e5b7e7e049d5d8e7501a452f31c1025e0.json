Winrar file, no pass needed.\n\n=============================\n\nIf you like my work, show you care, fuck the man, you damn well better share.\n\n=============================\n\nA note to all publishers of books for college level classes:\n\nMyself and all other students are tired of getting raped by you sorry bastards, rearranging chapters every 2yrs while adding nothing meaningful, just so you can sell more of your shit.\n\nWe agree that you need to be paid fair money for your work, rather than rape us like a cut-rate bitch. Since you don't see it that way, we are going to put it into terms you can understand. No more money for you. Your shit is gonna be free now, to anyone who wants it in a digital format.\n\nYou are not being fair to students, so we are not going to be fair to you. How you like that dick up your ass? Feels nice, doesn't it...\n\n=============================\n\nRipped by: EducatedMF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406e070e5b7e7e049d5d8e7501a452f31c1025e0","amp;dn":"Understanding+Basic+Statistics+%284th+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406e070e5b7e7e049d5d8e7501a452f31c1025e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,110,7,14,91,126,126,4,157,93,142,117,1,164,82,243,28,16,37,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
