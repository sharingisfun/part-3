It is a chance for Annie to create something timeless from a yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of music, to celebrate the artists that she has played on the radio and in the clubs throughout the year. Artists such as Duke Dumont, Rudimental, and Disclosure were first supported by Annie Mac, both on her Radio 1 shows and by Annie inviting them to perform to huge audiences at AMP events all over the country, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve all gone on to major mainstream success. In fact, the dance music she has championed on her Radio 1 flagship show and at her AMP events in 2014, has begun to take over the world. \n\n AMP 2013Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s compilation epitomised this, artists featured are now charts fixtures Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most notably Route 94, whose number 1 single and global smash Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was discovered by Annie and exclusively debuted on her album. The last two installments of Annie Mac Presents have topped the iTunes albums chart and 2014Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s selection is set to be even more popular. It features 8 #1 singles and 14 top 10Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s all supported by Annie from the likes of Duke Dumont, Keisza, Sigma and Clean Bandit, alongside more underground tunes from the likes of Jamie XX, FKA Twigs, Caribou, Nautic and more. Crucially for Annie as a champion of new music, there are also four exclusive tracks personally selected by Annie. These exclusive tracks (three hyperlinked here) from Tiga, Alex Adair, Lapsley and Hannah Wants and Chris Lorenzo are already gaining support online and across dancefloors around the country proving to be essential tracks for this year and next","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27545b05cdc773295b09c7324db4375fd830d8d1","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+Annie+Mac+Presents+2014+%282015%29+2CD%27s+%40+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27545b05cdc773295b09c7324db4375fd830d8d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,84,91,5,205,199,115,41,91,9,199,50,77,180,55,95,216,48,216,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
