Boyer, Uta C. Merzbach, Isaac Asimov\n\nWiley; 2 ed | 1991 | ISBN: 0471543977 | 736 pages | PDF | 72,4 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews:\n\n\n&quot;Boyer &amp; Merzbach distill thousands of years of mathematics into this fascinating chronicle. From the Greeks to Godel, the mathematics is brilliant; the cast of characters is distinguished; the ebb and flow of ideas is everywhere evident. And, while tracing the development of European mathematics, the authors do not overlook the contributions of Chinese, Indian, and Arabic civilizations. Without doubt, this isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and will long remainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a classic one-volume history of mathematics and mathematicians who create it.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ William Dunham,Author of Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics \n\n\n&quot;When we read a book like A History of Mathematics, we get the picture of a mounting structure, ever taller and broader and more beautiful and magnificentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and with a foundation, moreover, that is as untainted and as functional now as it was when Thales worked out the first geometrical theorems nearly 26 centuries ago.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½From the Foreword by Isaac Asimov &quot;One of the most useful and comprehensive general introductions to the subject.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ J. W. Dauben, City University of New York \n\n\n&quot;Both readable and scholarly, this book can serve as a fine introduction to the topic and also a reference book.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ J. David Bolter, University of North Carolina, Author of TuringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Man \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised to make it more accessible to a general audience, A History of Mathematics paints a vivid picture of humankindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relationship with numbers. Updated and expanded, it now offers broadened coverage of twentieth century advances in probability and computers, and updated references to further reading. A feature that will be of interest to every reader is an appendix containing an extensive chronological table of mathematical and general historical developments.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f736bdc5ee2b9de6ecacd47380b9a5a5c635af6","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Mathematics+%281991%29+intro+by+Isaac+Asimov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f736bdc5ee2b9de6ecacd47380b9a5a5c635af6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,115,107,220,94,226,185,222,110,202,205,71,56,11,154,90,92,99,90,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
