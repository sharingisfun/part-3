Released on 24 January 2011 in the United Kingdom and most of Europe, and on 22 February 2011 in North America, the album was named after the age of the singer at the time of its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown influences of Adele\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s debut album 19, also named after the singer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s age, but was further shaped by the American country and southern blues music she encountered during her 2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“09 North American tour, An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s separation from an unnamed partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter, and explores themes of anger, revenge, heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n\nTrack listing\n\nThe track listing was released through the UK iTunes Store on 30 November 2010.[179]\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tProducer(s) \tLength\n1. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Rolling in the Deep\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \tAdele Adkins, Paul Epworth \tEpworth \t3:48\n2. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Rumour Has It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \tAdkins, Ryan Tedder \tTedder \t3:43\n3. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Turning Tables\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \tAdkins, Tedder \tJim Abbiss \t4:10\n4. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t You Remember\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \tAdkins, Dan Wilson \tRick Rubin \t4:03\n5. \t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Set Fire to the Rain\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;   \tAdkins, Fraser T.
