Step on up and take a gander at the sequel to the most popular BMX game ever to hit a home console. MAT HOFFMAN'S PRO BMX 2 allows you to play as Hoffman or any of 10 other red-hot pros, trying to outrun the competition on tracks of all sorts. The full tour will take you through eight major American cities, challenging you to perform thousands of tricks in order to win out. In addition to the awesome single races, you can try your hand at such incredible modes as HORSE, Wreak Havoc, Road Trip, and a handful of multiplayer-only modes. One of the game's most impressive features is its all-new Trick Morpher, a device that allows you to meld tricks together, resulting in the most amazing tire taps, grinds, wall-rides, and manuals imaginable. In addition to all of the standard gameplay, there's an amazing Course Editor to help you spice things up.\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
