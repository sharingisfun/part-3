He Doesn't Like It. He Didn't Like His New Electric Guitar At First Either)&quot; is a 1969 album by Howlin' Wolf which mixed blues with psychedelic rock arrangements on several of Howlin' Wolf's classic songs. Howlin' Wolf strongly disliked the album, and Chess Records referenced this fact on the album's cover. The album peaked at #69 on the Billboard Black Albums chart.\n\n&quot;It s not often that an album disavowed by its own author at the time of release goes on to become considered a modern classic. Yet that s exactly what happened with Chicago blues legend Howlin Wolf s 1969 LP The Howlin Wolf Album, a release that has since attained mythical status due to the controversy behind it. Released on Cadet Records, a subsidiary of legendary imprint Chess Records, The Howlin Wolf Album was a radical experiment for a wellestablished artist: attempt to integrate electric instruments and psychedelic arrangements into his revered signature blues sound. The result was an album that Wolf himself initially disregarded on the nowinfamous cover, but one that has won a special place amongst dedicated music aficionados thanks to its unique mix of traditional blues and electric rock elements. Get On Down s reputation for high quality reissues continues with The Howlin Wolf Album, which features audio remastered from the original analog tapes for optimum sound quality and comes packaged in a mini paste-on jacket with obi strip and inner dust sleeve.&quot;/Amazon\n\n\nPersonnel:\nHowlin' Wolf Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, harmonica, vocals\nGene Barge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ horn, electric sax\nPete Cosey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, bowed guitar\nHubert Sumlin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\nRoland Faulkner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\nMorris Jennings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nDon Myrick Ã¢â‚¬â€œ flute\nLouis Satterfield Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\nPhil Upchurch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, guitar\nRon Malo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ recording engineer\nJeff Leowenthal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ photography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1658919bd4142ce920bd25d12904be0214c78cbb","amp;dn":"Howlin%27+Wolf+-+The+Howlin%27+Wolf+Album+%281969%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1658919bd4142ce920bd25d12904be0214c78cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,88,145,155,212,20,44,233,32,189,37,209,41,4,190,2,20,199,140,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
