Many a time-wasting fool's been gazing over the 'Yeezus' list of guest spots this past week. But it's unlikely you're going to remix a whole album out of sheer appreciation.\n\n That's unless you're Nico Jaar and Dave Harrington, aka Darkside. They've renamed their project &quot;daftside&quot; for the occasion, putting together their own version of Daft Punk's 'Random Access Memories'. It's called 'Random Access Memories Memories', which is a pretty tragic title until you consider all of the songs they've put together sound like distant, fragmented version of the originals; memories you can barely put your finger on. Quite clever, really.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:368701e2286e3bbbcab485f90b4b323b62e75941","amp;dn":"Daftside+-+Random+Access+Memories+remixed+by+Darkside","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"368701e2286e3bbbcab485f90b4b323b62e75941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,135,1,226,40,110,59,187,202,180,133,249,11,75,50,59,98,231,89,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
