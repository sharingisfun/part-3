But he was everything that gripped me, both the good and the bad. Worst case scenario if things turned awkward between us, I could go somewhere else. IÃ‚â€™d gotten over epic heartbreak before, one more wouldnÃ‚â€™t kill me. \n\n After moving to Austin following six months of unemployment back home, Iris Taylor knows she should be glad to have landed a job so quickly... even if the business is owned by a member of the same motorcycle club her estranged father used to belong to. Except Dex Locke might just be the biggest jerk sheÃ‚â€™s ever met. HeÃ‚â€™s rude, impatient and doesnÃ‚â€™t know how to tell time. \n\n And the last thing they ever expected was each other. \n\n But it was either the strip club or the tattoo shop. \n\nÃ‚â€¦ she should have chosen the strip club. \n\nÃ‚â€œBabe, IÃ‚â€™ve handpicked everythinÃ‚â€™ and everyone in here. I know what I want and I get what I want,Ã‚â€ he breathed. Ã‚â€œAnd I keep whatÃ‚â€™s mine.Ã‚â€ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f72bafb34bdb0933a5ce61f49781452ad2aca6","amp;dn":"Under+Locke+by+Mariana+Zapata.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f72bafb34bdb0933a5ce61f49781452ad2aca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,247,43,175,179,75,219,9,51,165,206,97,244,151,129,69,42,210,172,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
