Advances in Elastomers discusses the various attempts reported on solving these problems from the point of view of the chemistry and the structure of elastomers, highlighting the drawbacks and advantages of each method. It summarize the importance of elastomers and their multiphase systems in human life and industry, and covers all the topics related to recent advances in elastomers, their blends, IPNs, composites and nanocomposites.\n\nThis first volume focuses on advances on the blends and interpenetrating networks (IPNs) of elastomers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d103acbf42439bd3fcc476d80bb5e37f5883eab","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Elastomers+I+-+Blends+and+Interpenetrating+Networks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d103acbf42439bd3fcc476d80bb5e37f5883eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,16,58,203,244,36,57,189,63,204,71,109,128,187,94,55,245,136,62,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
