Qi Gong is a Chinese health system that's been practiced for centuries to improve mental and physical awareness. Taught by Matthew Cohen, a martial-arts master with 30 yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experience, these two programs cultivate strength and tranquility in the mind and body.\n\nThe Tai Chi program contains three segments. First, you'll learn the essential poses of Tai Chi. Next, you'll move through the postures to create harmony and grace while increasing flexibility and endurance. Finally, you'll put it all together to build overall muscle tone and promote vigor and vitality.\n\nThe Qi Gong program conditions the body and expands the senses through slow, natural, repetitive movements. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll stimulate your immune system and gain a sense of balance and inner calm with this healing practice.\n\nVideo; x264; 720*576 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58181f6a5e903aa4876574bcc9f77af516606f9c","amp;dn":"Tai+Chi+%26amp%3B+Qi+Gong+Basics+with+Matthew+Cohen+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58181f6a5e903aa4876574bcc9f77af516606f9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,24,31,106,94,144,58,164,135,101,116,188,201,247,122,245,22,96,111,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
