It was released on the RCA label. A few verses from &quot;Manchester, England&quot; and a small portion of &quot;Walking in Space&quot; have been removed. The film omits the songs &quot;The Bed&quot;, &quot;Dead End&quot;, &quot;Oh Great God of Power&quot;, &quot;I Believe in Love&quot;, &quot;Going Down&quot;, &quot;Abie Baby&quot;, &quot;Frank Mills&quot;, and &quot;What a Piece of Work is Man&quot; from the musical. The latter five songs were originally recorded for the film, but were eventually cut. They can be found on this album, although they were omitted on the 1990 reissue. While the songs &quot;Don't Put It Down&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; are not sung by characters in the movie, they are both used as background or instrumental music for scenes at the army base. A new song written by MacDermot for the film is &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;. There are several other differences from songs in the movie and as they appear on the soundtrack, mainly in omitted verses and different orchestrations.\n\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Pop, R&amp;B\nQuality: FLAC/tracks (lossless)\n\nTracklist:\n01.
