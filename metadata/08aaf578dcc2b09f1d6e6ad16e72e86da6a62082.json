You will have to ensure that they have a constant supply of oxygen, food and water to stay alive.\r\n\r\nYou will get them to collect energy, extract water, mine metal, grow food, manufacture bots, and build a fully self-sufficient base.\r\n\r\nEven if the game is not intended to be a simulator, all the mechanics are plausible, and based on what the expected challenges of establishing a colony in an new planet would be.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Windows Vista/7/8/10\r\nProcessor: 2 GHz Dual Core\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: 512 MB VRAM (Shader Model 3)\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c\r\nHard Drive: 550 MB available space \r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\nThis is a quick fix for the duration of the night on the Desert and Frozen planets. \r\nIt will now last for 8 hours instead of 12.
