On that album, Plant blurred boundaries between several musical styles, playing covers with a group assembled by producer Buddy Miller, but here he shifts that omnivorous aesthetic to a collection of originals performed with his ever-changing band the Sensational Space Shifters.\nCertain flourishes sound familiar Ã¢â‚¬â€ he remains equally enamored of English and Moroccan folk while retaining an enduring obsession with American blues and psychedelia Ã¢â‚¬â€ but the feel is different, not as robust as Band of Joy or warmly joyous as Raising Sand. The Ceaseless Roar may not get loud Ã¢â‚¬â€ usually, when it rocks it sounds like a kissing cousin to a folk rave-up; sometimes, as on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Somebody There,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chiming, crystalline, and bright like the Byrds Ã¢â‚¬â€ but it is intensely meditative, finding sustenance within mystery. Plant is reflecting on where heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been Ã¢â‚¬â€ singing Ã¢â‚¬Å“And if the sun refuses to shineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pocketful of Golden,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he tips a hat to his Zeppelin past; elsewhere he speaks of getting lost in America Ã¢â‚¬â€ yet gingerly avoiding questions of mortality and resisting the allure of easy sentimentality. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to hear the weight of his years on lullaby andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The Ceaseless Roar Ã¢â‚¬â€ it is, in the best sense, mature music, dense in its rhythms and allusions, subtle in its melodies Ã¢â‚¬â€ but he never feels weary, nor does he traffic in false nostalgia. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s building upon the past, both his own and the larger traditions of his homeland, both spiritual and actual, and that gives lullaby andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The Ceaseless Roar a bewitching depth. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an album to get lost in.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:856a330017b498e0bbaebc8d777588f43387ad1e","amp;dn":"Robert+Plant+-+Lullaby+and...The+Ceaseless+Roar+%282014%29+MP3VBR+Be","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"856a330017b498e0bbaebc8d777588f43387ad1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,106,51,0,23,180,152,224,187,174,188,141,119,117,136,244,51,135,173,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
