The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar, synthesizers) and Phil Selway (drums, percussion).\n\nRadiohead released their first single, &quot;Creep&quot;, in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.\n\nKid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked an evolution in Radiohead's musical style, as the group incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by war, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. The band's first six albums, released via EMI, had sold more than twenty-five million copies by 2007.[1] Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), originally as a digital download for which customers could set their own price, and later in physical form to critical and chart success.\n\nRadiohead's work has appeared in a large number of listener polls and critics' lists.[2][3] For example, in 2005 Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's list of &quot;the greatest artists of all time&quot;.[4] While the band's earlier albums were particularly influential on British rock and pop music,[5] their later albums brought them a wide audience.[6] Their work has influenced other musicians in genres ranging from jazz and classical music to hip hop and R&amp;B. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best Of 2008\n\n\nRadiohead: The Best Of is a compilation album of English alternative rock band Radiohead. The album features singles, album tracks and one B-side the band released from 1993 to 2003 while with EMI.[1] The first disc, also available separately, comprises the majority of the band's charting hits, while the second disc concentrates on less commercially successful singles and other tracks. All of the material on both discs had been previously released. As a parallel release, a DVD compilation featured 21 music videos,[2] of which nine were released on DVD for the first time. The compilation debuted at number 4 in the UK album charts, and critical reception to the compilation was generally positive.\n\nThis is the first released compilation of Radiohead's songs, but it had not been sanctioned by the band;[3] it was prepared by EMI after the band's departure, and Radiohead band members did not participate in selecting the tracks. Nevertheless, according to interviews the band had major input through their career in the choice of most of their singles that were later included on the compilation. A few non-singles which remain regulars in the band's live sets were also included, such as &quot;Idioteque&quot; and &quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; from Kid A, their only album without singles.\n\nMembers of the band have expressed their disapproval of the compilation; they once stated in an interview in 2003 that they would never release a greatest hits collection. Radiohead: The Best Of was prepared soon after they decided not to re-sign with the label. In 2008 singer Thom Yorke said, &quot;We havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really had any hits so what exactly is the purpose? ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing we can do about it. The work is really public property now anyway... ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a wasted opportunity in that if weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been behind it, and we wanted to do it, then it might have been good&quot;.[4] The compilation contains only songs to which EMI holds the publishing rights; all of the tracks were recorded before Radiohead's seventh studio album, In Rainbows (2007), as the band ended their contract with EMI in 2004 and signed with other labels for future distribution.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Just&quot; (from The Bends) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n2.\t&quot;Paranoid Android&quot; (from OK Computer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:27\n3.\t&quot;Karma Police&quot; (from OK Computer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n4.\t&quot;Creep&quot; (from Pablo Honey) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n5.\t&quot;No Surprises&quot; (from OK Computer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n6.\t&quot;High and Dry&quot; (from The Bends) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n7.\t&quot;My Iron Lung&quot; (from The Bends) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n8.\t&quot;There There&quot; (from Hail to the Thief) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:23\n9.\t&quot;Lucky&quot; (from OK Computer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n10.\t&quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; (from The Bends) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n11.\t&quot;Idioteque&quot; (originally from Kid A) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n12.\t&quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot; (from Hail to the Thief) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n13.\t&quot;The Bends&quot; (from The Bends) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n14.\t&quot;Pyramid Song&quot; (from Amnesiac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n15.\t&quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot; (from The Bends) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n16.\t&quot;Everything in Its Right Place&quot; (from Kid A) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3b5a65ba44266b8cac917d21fd3f043d925a069","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+Best+of+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2008+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3b5a65ba44266b8cac917d21fd3f043d925a069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,181,166,91,164,66,102,184,202,201,23,210,31,211,240,67,217,37,160,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
