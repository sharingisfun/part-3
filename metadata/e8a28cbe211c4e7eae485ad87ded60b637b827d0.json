The\nactions involve Ã¢â‚¬Å“breaking downÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of an image into a number of elements such as the inner pages of a book, a bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover pages, individual photos, filmstrips, stripes. At the end the original image is presented as a combination of these elements. All layers are placed within a group and left intact for you to manipulate to taste.\n\n\nTHE FILM MACHINE\n\nThe FILM MACHINE Photoshop1 actions create 15 different filmstrip effects using your images. The package contains three action sets; the FILM MACHINE 2 PICS, the FILM MACHINE 3 PICS and the FILM MACHINE 4 PICS. The first set uses 2 images to produce the effect. The second set uses 3 images while the third set uses 4 images to produce the final filmstrip. The actions are designed for Photoshop v.7 and higher. Since there are a number of memory demanding steps (copy, insert path, etc), I recommend you free up computer memory in advance, by closing any other applications, if your system resources are limited.\n\n\nTHE PANOS CUBE ACTIONS\n\nContains 2 action sets:\nThe first set (Panos cube_1 IMAGE) lets you create 9 different cubes, using 1 image of your choice.\nThe second set (Panos cube_3 IMAGES) lets you create 9 different cubes, using 3 images of your choice. All the images must have the SAME size.\nIn total there are 18 different cube effects! Just follow the instructions given while the\nactions run.\n\nInfo:\n\n- Copy *atn files to Adobe Photoshop/Presets/Actions\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/494/screenkfm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/494/screenkfm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img688.imageshack.us/img688/3379/cubefn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img688.imageshack.us/img688/3379/cubefn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a28cbe211c4e7eae485ad87ded60b637b827d0","amp;dn":"PanosFX+Actions+for+Photoshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a28cbe211c4e7eae485ad87ded60b637b827d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,162,140,190,33,28,78,126,174,72,90,216,125,237,96,182,55,184,39,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
