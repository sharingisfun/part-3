From politicians to hedge-fund managers to middle-class IRA holders, everyone must pay attention to how and why the global economy works the way it does.\n\nEnter Financial Times columnist and best-selling author Tim Harford.

With the wit of a raconteur and the clear grasp of an expert, Harford explains whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really happening beyond todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headlines, why all of us should care, and what we can do about it to understand it better.
