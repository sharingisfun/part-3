This book summarizes in a fairly comprehensive manner the recent technical research accomplishments in the area of thermodynamics, characterizations, and applications of polymer blends.\n\nIn the first chapter, an overview of thermodynamic behaviors of non-equilibrium polymers is discussed. In the consecutive chapters, different properties of polymer blends are discussed, including surface tension, transition, crystallization, morphology, and flow behaviors. Miscibility and molecular characterizations of polymer blends are also covered in this book. Applications to various systems are reviewed, and both experimental concerns and references are supplied. In this time when science has such a strong tendency for diversification, this book demonstrates the relevance of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own activities with neighboring branches of activities.\n\nThis book is unique in that the mathematics of the physics of polymers are minimized in order not to discourage the interest of a junior or senior undergraduate or new graduate student by an unnecessarily rigorous approach. However, book aims to widen the readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ general knowledge with a better understanding of the physics of polymers. Applications to various systems are reviewed, and both experimental concerns and references are supplied.\n\nAbout the Authors\nChin Han Chan, PhD, is a registered chemist with research interests in physical properties of polymer blends as well as Associate Professor at the Universite Teknologi MARA (MARA University of Technology) in Malaysia. She is a council member of the Malaysian Institute of Chemistry and has been appointed Chair of the Polymer Committee of the Institute of Materials, Malaysia. She has published more than 40 papers in international and national refereed journals, more than 60 publications in conference proceedings, and more than 15 invited lectures for international conferences.\n\nChin Hua Chia, PhD, is a senior lecturer at the School of Applied Physics with the faculty of Science and Technology at Universiti Kebangassan in Selangor, Malaysia. A recipient of the Young Scientist Award from the National University of Malaysia in 2012, he is a member of several professional organizations and has published several book chapters and articles in professional journals as well as has presented a professional meetings.\n\nDr. Sabu Thomas is the Director of the School of Chemical Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam, India. He is also a full professor of polymer science and engineering and the Director of the Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology of the same university. Professor Thomas has authored or co-authored many papers in international peer-reviewed journals in the area of polymer processing. He has organized several international conferences and has more than 420 publications, 11 books and two patents to his credit. Professor Thomas is listed as the 5th position in the list of Most Productive Researchers in India, in 2008.\n\nCONTENTS\nList of Contributors....ix\nList of Abbreviations....xi\nPreface....xv\n\nPart 1 Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules\n1.
