The pilot was aired on television on May 13, 2007, with the actual season starting September 28, 2008. Superjail! is characterized by its psychedelic shifts in setting and plot, and its extreme graphic violence [3]ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½hence its TV-MA V rating. These elements are depicted through highly elaborate animated sequences, which have been described as &quot;...[b]aroque and complicated and hard to take in at a single viewing&quot;.[4]\n\nThe premise centers around events that take place in a rather unusual prison.\n\nSetting and premise\n\nThe majority of Superjail! is set inside the titular prison. Externally, Superjail is built inside a volcano which is itself located in a larger volcano. Internally, it seems to constitute its own reality, where the fabric of time and space is extremely fluid and changes at the whim of the Warden, but generally the episode begins with a linear story and builds up to a violent psychedelic splendor. Superjail's inmate population is stated by Jared to be in excess of 70,000, although the show's creators mention that the jail processes &quot;billions of inmates&quot;.[5]\n\nEach episode follows a similar pattern. The criminal Jacknife is brought to Superjail by Jailbot. During this time, or occasionally as a result of his arrival, one event or another will inspire the Warden to carry out some sort of crazy scheme, which the Twins almost always interfere with. The combination of these two factors inevitably leads to a spectacular psychedelic bloodbath when the prisoners are driven to violence. Many prisoners end up dying as a result, often in humorously horrific ways, while Jacknife escapes in the confusion to be caught again in the next episode.\n\n[edit] Characters\n\n    * The Warden (voiced by David Wain) is the proprietor of Superjail. Clad in a purple suit with gloves, and a purple top hat, the Warden has been described as a &quot;sadistic Willy Wonka&quot;.[6] He is portrayed in real life at the end of the episode &quot;Dream Machine&quot; by Tim Harrington, frontman of the Brooklyn-based indie group Les Savy Fav.[7]\n\n    * Jared (voiced by Teddy Cohn) is Superjail's large headed uptight accountant, and a recovering alcoholic. A constant nervous wreck, he is always worrying about what the Warden will do next to jeopardize the budget.\n\n    * Alice (voiced by Christy Karacas) is the extremely well-built guard in Superjail, and apparently the only guard aside from Jailbot. Alice has a very masculine manner, such as an extremely deep voice, facial hair, and a bulge in her skirt.\n\n    * Jailbot is a tombstone-shaped levitating robot that performs tasks in and around Superjail, such as piloting vehicles and transporting prisoners. He essentially acts as the Warden's gopher.[8] Jailbot is mute, with a screen that displays a simple expressive face. He has two compartments on his sides that hold a seemingly limitless number of objects used to perform his duties.\n\n    * The Doctor is the resident physician of Superjail. He regularly experiments on the inmates.\n\n    * The Twins (voiced by Richard Mathar) are two blond identical twins who inhabit a lab under Superjail and use unexplained powers to interfere with the Warden's plans.\n\n    * Jackknife (voiced by Christy Karacas) is a low-level criminal who gets captured by Jailbot and taken to Superjail at the beginning of every episode. He likewise escapes near the end, though there are a few exceptions.\n\n    * Couple Two inmates that appear in almost every episode, they share a cell and act like a stereotypical married couple.\n\n    * Pervert A fat and perverted member of Superjail who speaks in a high and feminine voice and whose actions often result in him being mutilated in a particularly gruesome manner(usually toward his genitals).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca933e618211d03189539949214ca2ab631e3461","amp;dn":"SuperJail%21+season+1+%2B+pilot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca933e618211d03189539949214ca2ab631e3461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,147,62,97,130,17,208,49,137,83,153,73,33,76,162,171,99,30,52,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
