This film is quite different from the other films made by Ingmar Bergman, it might be because it's produced by Dino De Laurentiis and that the film was supposed to appeal to a broader audience (I'm just speculating).\n\nEnglish subtitles in *.srt file.\n\nPlot summary (from IMDB): Ingmar Bergman's The Serpent's Egg follows a week in the life of Abel Rosenberg, an out-of-work American circus acrobat living in poverty-stricken Berlin following Germany's defeat in World War I. When his brother commits suicide, Abel seeks refuge in the apartment of an old acquaintance Professor Veregus. Desperate to make ends meet in the war-ravaged city, Abel takes a job in Veregus' clinic, where he discovers the horrific truth behind the work of the strangely beneficent professor and unlocks the chilling mystery that drove his brother to kill himself.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076686/\n\nTotal Streams:  2\nRunning Time:  1:59:22\nIndex Chunk:  Yes\nInterleaved:  Yes\nMax Bytes Per Sec:  0\nAUDIO: 0 - MP3 (0x55)\n     Average Bitrate Per Sec:  76 kb/s\n     Samples Rate:  48000 Hz\n     Channels:  1\n     Bits Per Sample:  0\n     Variable Bitrate:  Yes  (32, 56, 128)\nVIDEO:  XVID\n     B-VOP: No\n     S(GMC)-VOP: No\n     QuarterPixel: No\n     Frame Size:  544 x 320\n     Frames Rate:  23.976\n     Color Depth:  12\n     Total Frames:  171740","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f9a5df1e529abd7da87f5632a4ac3d6d62b398f","amp;dn":"The+Serpent%5C%27s+Egg+1977+Ingmar+Bergman+%5BCiN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f9a5df1e529abd7da87f5632a4ac3d6d62b398f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,154,93,241,229,41,171,215,218,135,245,99,42,74,195,214,214,43,57,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
