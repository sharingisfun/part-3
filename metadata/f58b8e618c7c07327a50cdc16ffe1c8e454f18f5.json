Warner was raised in Putnam, Connecticut, across the street from a railroad station, which later inspired her to write about children living in a boxcar. In 1918, she began what would become a thirty-two year career teaching first and third grade at the Israel Putnam School. She died in Putnam on August 30, 1979, when she was eighty-nine years old. But the Boxcar Children live on: to this day, talented authors contribute new stories to the series, which now totals over 120 books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58b8e618c7c07327a50cdc16ffe1c8e454f18f5","amp;dn":"The+Boxcar+Children+Mysteries+Box+Set%3A+Books+1-12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58b8e618c7c07327a50cdc16ffe1c8e454f18f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,139,142,97,140,124,7,50,122,80,205,193,111,254,28,142,69,79,24,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
