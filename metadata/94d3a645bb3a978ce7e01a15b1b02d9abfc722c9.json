Flashdance opened to bad reviews by professional critics but was a surprise box office success, becoming the third highest grossing film of 1983 in the USA[1][2]. It had a worldwide box-office gross of more than $100 million[3]. Its soundtrack spawned several hit songs, among them &quot;Maniac&quot; performed by Michael Sembello and the Academy Award-winning &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot;, performed by Irene Cara, which was written for the film.\n\n\n\n\n\n[b]Flashdance [/b] 1983\n\n\n\n\nFlashdance is the soundtrack to the 1983 American musical and romance film Flashdance, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and starring Jennifer Beals and Michael Nouri. It sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. The film is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and follows Alex, a welder and exotic dancer and her dreams of becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nThe film's two singles feature on the album, &quot;Flashdance...What a Feeling&quot; by Irene Cara and &quot;Maniac&quot; by Michael Sembello. Both these singles peaked at #1 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[1][2] The album was massively successful, selling over 6 million copies in the U.S. and 1 million in Japan. It was certified gold by RIAA on June 17, 1983, and became multi-platinum on October 12, 1984 and again on June 21, 1996[3] In Japan, the album topped the chart for 11 weeks in total, and became the biggest-selling album of 1983. [4]\n\nThe music in Flashdance was supervised by Phil Ramone. There are several pieces of music used in the film that do not appear on the soundtrack album, including &quot;Gloria&quot; by Laura Branigan; &quot;I Love Rock and Roll&quot; by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts; and the &quot;Adagio in G Minor&quot; by Tommaso Albinoni.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nFlashdance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦What A Feeling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Irene Cara\nHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a Dream ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Shandi Sinnamon\nLove Theme From Flashdance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Helen St. John\nManhunt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Karen Kamon\nLady, Lady, Lady ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Joe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Esposito\nImagination ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Laura Branigan\nRomoe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Donna Summer\nSeduce Me Tonight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Cycle V\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Be Here Where The Heart Is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Kim Carnes\nManiac ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Michael Sembello\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94d3a645bb3a978ce7e01a15b1b02d9abfc722c9","amp;dn":"Flashdance+-+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+1983+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94d3a645bb3a978ce7e01a15b1b02d9abfc722c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,211,166,69,187,58,151,140,231,224,26,21,177,176,45,154,191,199,34,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
