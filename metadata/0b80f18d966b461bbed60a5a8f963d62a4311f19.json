Frank Welker, who voiced George in the 2006 feature film, returns here as the voice of Curious George. The show is currently broadcast on PBS Kids.\n\n\nWhen the show was developed, educational advisers suggested using it to teach science, math, and engineering concepts. Episodes are often structured around a &quot;try-fail&quot; series of incidents, which proved to be a good way to show scientific inquiries. \n\n\nHere's the the second half of season 8, which aired in May 2014. These were encoded by me, from my digital recordings off my local PBS station. These may be the final episodes of Curious George, unless it gets renewed for a ninth season...if it does, new episodes may air in 2015.\n\n\nIf you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment! And please continue to seed after your download completes, so that others can enjoy this great kids educational show. If people keep seeding, I will continue to post more great children's shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b80f18d966b461bbed60a5a8f963d62a4311f19","amp;dn":"Curious+George+%28PBS+Kids%29+Season+8%2C+Episodes+4-6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b80f18d966b461bbed60a5a8f963d62a4311f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,128,241,141,150,107,70,27,190,214,10,90,143,150,61,98,164,49,31,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
