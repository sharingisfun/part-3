The pilot single, &quot;Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)&quot;, was arguably her greatest work to date, a dense and intriguing composition with a sound uniquely her own. The single reached the UK Top 5 and broke Bush into the US Top 30 for the first time in her career. The chart-topping album Hounds Of Love soon followed and was greeted with an acclaim that dwarfed all her previous accolades and efforts. By any standards, it was an exceptional work and revealed Bush at the zenith of her powers. Songs such as the eerily moving &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort&quot; (about a murderer) and the dramatic &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; (inspired by A Book Of Dreams by Peter Reich, son of Freudian Marxist Wilhelm Reich) underlined her strengths not only as a writer and singer, but most crucially as a producer. The outstanding video accompanying the latter featured Donald Sutherland. An entire side of the album, titled &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; and relating the thoughts of a drowning woman, fused Arthurian legend and Jungian psychology in a musical framework, part orchestral and part folk. After this, Bush could never again be regarded as a quaint pop artist.&quot;\n\nBooksmusicfilmstv.com review:\n\n&quot;Kate's masterpiece. A beautifully uplifting work, innovative and eclectic.\n\n'Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)' and 'Hounds Of Love' are examples to modern pop princesses of how to be respected for one's talent. Well constructed songs, clever production, vibrant, inventive, and beautifully sung. Kate's little girl voice surfaces in the mesmerising, if over long, 'The Big Sky', while 'Mother Stands For Comfort' is a beautifully wistful piece, and the rhythm of 'Cloudbusting' is truly infectious. Side 2 sounds like world music. 'And Dream Of Sheep' is a sweet, simple song. 'Under Ice' is darker, with short, sharp menacing chords and lines. The whales are in fine form on 'Waking The Witch', which has the listener being thrown off balance, as it bursts into something you'd expect from 'The Exorcist'. 'Watching You Without Me' sees Kate's finest vocals on the album, in a heady mix of beautiful voice, beautiful New Age sound and harmonies, and voice cut-ups. 'Jig Of Life' has a traditional Irish feel, with a modern treatment - and Kate sounding like a lively colleen! A wonderfully rich sound. 'Hello Earth' is intriguing. Looking at man's insignificance in the face of the power of nature. With a medieval choral piece coming in unexpectedly, this displays Ms. Bush's gift for the unexpected. Then the whales join in with the medieval choir and Kate! The final song, 'The Morning Fog', is a driving, poignant, touching, New Age/folk hybrid.\n\nTo sum up...wow!\n\n- Paul Rance&quot; \n\n\n\nTRACKS:\n\nHounds of Love (Side 1)\n=======================\n\n01.
