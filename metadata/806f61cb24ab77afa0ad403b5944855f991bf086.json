He gave to them life and thought, and so were born the Spirit of Light and the Prince of Darkness. But the Prince held the unspoken desire of supplanting his Father. He learnt in secret the language of Creation and tried to create a new being. But the new born would not accept the commands of the Prince of Darkness, and growing stronger, took part of his own essence and created terrible monsters and demons. The Lord and the Prince of Light tried to stop it, and they waged a great war. Gradually the being was weakened and finally defeated, but after this the Father was exhausted, and withdrew into the depths of the Universe. But all that was long ago... Now, something strange is happening. The signals are clear. Foul creatures are awakening from their dormancy, and spreading terror and destruction... The Darkness has returned, and the end is near. A new hero is needed, a chosen one who will wield the Sword, and destroy the Enemy forever...\n\nIf you have a craving for a bloodbath, then Blade of Darkness is for you! Chop off the limbs of your enemies and beat them to death with their own arm or leg! Wield a wonderful variety of weapons--from swords, axes, clubs to awe-inspiring great hammers--and lay waste to the foul demons that stand between you and your goal: to destroy the Darkness once and for all! Blade of Darkness is a third-person perspective combat adventure with four unique champions--the barbarian Tukaram, the dwarf Naglfar, the knight Sargon, and the Amazon Zoe--each with their own unique movesets and style.
