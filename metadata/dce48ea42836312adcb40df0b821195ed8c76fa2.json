In the new version you will find many changes. We have estimated the work of 5.9 and worked hard to improve the program. In addition, we have prepared several innovations, which we are going to describe here more detailed.\n\nShort list of important changes: greatly reduced memory usage, we introduced convenient addition of new ad filters, integration with WoT is now a separate extension, added support for new browsers, fixed conflicts with popular programs and defects in the processing of requests and more.\n\nchanges in version 5.10:\n\nAdded support for CSS injection rules. It gives us more flexible options for high-quality elements blocking.\nAbility to edit the source code of userscripts. Now you can customize any script you like, you can find more about what it is and how to install it here.\nUpdates are checked only for the enabled userscripts.Thus we update only those scripts that you actually use. Why spend the extra traffic?\nExtensions that do not use external resources are returned to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“default.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Now you have the opportunity to reset the extensions and return websites to their original state.\nAdded a configuration of exceptions for secure (HTTPS) sites filtering. Adding https websites to exceptions in order for Adguard to not filter it, used to be impossible.\nIncreased time of filter updates up to 12 hours. Yeah, longer but of better quality.\nSpeeded up the work of extensions (including Youtube Center). Userscripts do not slow down websites now.\nFixed in new version:\n\nFixed conflicts with Visual Studio, Tor Browser, Keepass.\nFixed slow loading of large js files.\nAssistant no longer interferes in work of RequireJs websites.\nUpdated network drivers, fixed some small remarks.\nFixed a defect with the processing of HTTP DELETE requests.\nFixed work of Twitch Chat Filter userscript.\nFixed a bug when using proxy authorization.\nFixed compatibility error ofand Parental Control.\nFixed a defect with disabling Adguard assistant via the context menu.\nFixed some minor defects of Adguard assistant.\nSpeeded up filtering of some pages (fixed problem with octane-benchmark.googlecode.com).\nFixed API for usercripts (thanks to YoutubeCenter developer, Jeppe Rune Mortensen).\nFixed rules with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“~third-partyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ modifier.\nNew versions of TDI and WFP drivers. Fixed some compatibility issues.\nMinor changes to the texts in the user interface.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dce48ea42836312adcb40df0b821195ed8c76fa2","amp;dn":"adguard-5.10%2BCrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dce48ea42836312adcb40df0b821195ed8c76fa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,228,142,164,40,54,49,42,220,180,13,240,184,33,25,94,216,199,111,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
