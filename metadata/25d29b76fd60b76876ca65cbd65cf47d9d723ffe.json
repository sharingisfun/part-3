It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Frank R. Pierson, with Troy Garity starring as Barry and Lee Pace starring as Calpernia.\n\nBarry was a private with the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army, stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Calpernia was working as a showgirl at a transgender revue in Nashville, Tennessee when the two met in 1999. Barry's roommate Justin Fisher (played by Shawn Hatosy) brought Barry to the club where she performed. When Barry and Calpernia began seeing each other regularly, Fisher began spreading rumors on base about their relationship, which appeared to be a violation of the military's &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; policy about discussing the sexual orientation of military personnel. The film depicts the increasing harassment and pressure Barry faced, which exploded into violence over Fourth of July weekend. While Calpernia performed in a pageant in Nashville, Barry was beaten to death in his sleep with a baseball bat by Calvin Glover, who had been goaded by Fisher into committing the crime. The film ends with a discussion of the aftermath. The film depicts Fisher as a sexually confused manipulator jealous of Barry or Calpernia or both.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25d29b76fd60b76876ca65cbd65cf47d9d723ffe","amp;dn":"Soldier%5C%27s+Girl+%28Transsexual+%2F+Transgender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25d29b76fd60b76876ca65cbd65cf47d9d723ffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,210,155,118,253,96,183,104,118,202,101,203,214,92,244,125,157,114,63,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
