In his agonized search for absolute truth, Russell crosses paths with legendary thinkers like Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert, and Kurt GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶del, and finds a passionate student in the great Ludwig Wittgenstein. But his most ambitious goal--to establish unshakable logical foundations of mathematics--continues to loom before him. Through love and hate, peace and war, Russell persists in the dogged mission that threatens to claim both his career and his personal happiness, finally driving him to the brink of insanity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:648eb42479de5e4e319b21e3825c379d88d387d7","amp;dn":"Logicomix+-+An+Epic+Search+For+Truth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"648eb42479de5e4e319b21e3825c379d88d387d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,142,180,36,121,222,94,78,49,155,33,227,130,92,55,157,136,211,135,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
