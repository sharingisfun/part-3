Ben-Shahar\n\n\nThe course focuses on the psychological aspects of a fulfilling and flourishing life. Topics include happiness, self-esteem, empathy, friendship, love, achievement, creativity, music, spirituality, and humor.\n\nRecently Tal has left Harvard to focus on freelance speaking and writing. He has asked the University to take down all video lectures so that those interested in positive psychology would instead buy his book. Harvard agreed. If you still want to watch the video lectures here they are. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:497dc752929890b098c24a3e7a1075cc255df4d7","amp;dn":"Harvard+-+Tal+D.+Ben-Shahar+-+Positive+Psychology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"497dc752929890b098c24a3e7a1075cc255df4d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,125,199,82,146,152,144,176,152,194,74,62,122,16,117,204,37,93,244,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
