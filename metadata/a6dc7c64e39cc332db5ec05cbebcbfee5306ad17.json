Produced by Brian McTernan, the  \nalbum features thirteen powerful tracks. Back in full     \nforce, Set Your Goals will keep the momentum going with    \nthe follow-up to their infectious and dynamic album, This \nWill Be The Death of Us. Duel vocalists Matt Wilson and   \nJordan Brown's flawless delivery on the opening track     \n&quot;Cure For Apathy&quot; captures the SYG sound and energy we    \nknow so well as they trade off singing duties. &quot;Certain,&quot; \na soon to be fan favorite, highlights Joe Saucedo's solid \nbass lines with passionate lyrics and engaging guitar     \nsolos. Keeping it real for die hard fans, Burning At Both \nEnds has a definitive Set Your Goals sound with their     \nenergetic, head-bobbing riffs and gang vocals while       \nstaying completely fresh with sing-along choruses and     \nlyrics everyone can relate to. The album delivers with the\nfast and hard-hitting track, &quot;Trenches&quot; that showcases Dan\nCoddaire and Audelio Flores' catchy melodies and guitar   \nriffs. &quot;Exit Summer,&quot; brings back 90's hardcore with a    \nmelodic twist, an irresistible combination. SYG finishes  \nthe album with &quot;Not As Bad&quot; where Mike Ambrose            \ndemonstrates his tightknit drumming with crazy fills on   \ntop of pleasant harmonies - a great way to close out the  \nalbum.                                                    \n\n\n\nGroup E-Mail: \n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c6b2a7adb3aba7b4b5aba9a8ada3bf86a1aba7afaae8a5a9ab&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;  \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Music!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6dc7c64e39cc332db5ec05cbebcbfee5306ad17","amp;dn":"Set+Your+Goals-Burning+At+Both+Ends-2011-TAKU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6dc7c64e39cc332db5ec05cbebcbfee5306ad17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,220,124,100,227,156,195,50,219,94,192,92,190,188,191,238,83,6,173,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
