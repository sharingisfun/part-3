This is my first upload, so have patience if everything doesn't go quite as smoothly as it should.\n\nContained (hopefully) in this directory are: \n\nRosetta Stone V3 Korean\n\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n\n\n     If you've never torrented/installed Rosetta Stone before, you must download the application (preferably the latest dependable cracked V3) [EDIT: Apparently there are compatibility issues with v3.2.11., but v3.3.5 worked fine for me]* from somewhere else (not hard to find). Being relatively new to torrents and using ISO files myself, I personally found VirtualCloneDrive to be by far the most simple, no-fuss application for loading ISO files. Download this, and you can simply click on the ISO file and have it instantly pop up as a new disc drive.\n\n*This is my experience if this is helpful: There seem to be a number of variants of the cracked Rosetta V3 App. Of the two different kinds I have come across, one was a v3.2 that is unlocked by running a separate application that modifies a .dll file. For me, this resulted in the bypassing of the registration screen completely and receiving a minor error message. The other (the one I use now) is a cracked v3.5 that instead requires replacing an .exe file in the Rosetta Stone Program Files folder with what I would assume is a hacked copy. However, in this one, I am still always asked to register, but, at least, this doesn't at all affect my access to all of the lessons, and I can live with it. Of the two, I myself only received a trojan alert from McAfee from the first one. \nThe reason why I switched to the v3.5, as well as for me suggesting you get this one or later, arose from the fact that when I tried using a copy of Arabic Level I with v3.2, the lessons where filled with malfunctioning slides that caused it to lock up and loose all of my progress for a lesson. When I tried updating the Arabic to try to alleviate the problem, it required me to update to v3.5 first. This caused it become locked again, making registration imperative to accessing the complete course. So I uninstalled it, found and installed a cracked v3.5, reinstalled the Arabic, updated just the Arabic, and it works perfectly. I have installed 8-9 other languages and no issues have arisen thus far. However, this probably is because I was able to keep the languages completely updated. In my opinion, doing this is the best way to safeguard against glitches. But you must ONLY update the languages, and in order to do that, you must already have the latest version of the application installed and already cracked. Note: so far since I have installed it, there have been no update requests for this version of Korean.\n\n\nThis is the protocol I have been using for installing:\n\n1. Having VirtualCloneDrive installed, click on the ISO file (if asked what to \n   &quot;Open with&quot;, check it to always open ISO's with VirtualCloneDrive).\n\n2. A new CD drive will open up called something on the order of Korean_1(F:) or \n   something vaguely like that, containing a number of folders. Ignore this, you\n   can leave it open if you'd like.\n\n3. Open up your already successfully installed and cracked Version 3 of Rosetta \n   Stone, and find the option to Add/Remove Languages and click. A window will pop\n   up telling you to put in a Language CD. Do nothing and click continue.\n\n4. Korean Level # should appear on a drop down menu. Click Install.\n\n5. Repeat 1-4 for all levels.\n \n\n6. Go annoy the waiters at your favorite Korean BBQ restaurant with your newly\n   acquired ability to tell them in their native tongue that the girl is running,\n   the man is reading a newspaper, and that you like the red dress better than the \n   white dress.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab099c5b2de727b1605352010e04ce9a3eb0423","amp;dn":"Rosetta+Stone+V3.3.5+Korean+%28Levels+1-3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab099c5b2de727b1605352010e04ce9a3eb0423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,176,153,197,178,222,114,123,22,5,53,32,16,224,76,233,163,235,4,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
