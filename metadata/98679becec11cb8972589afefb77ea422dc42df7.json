But which of the bakers will impress Mary and Paul enough to earn their place in the quarter-final, and which baker will be hanging up their apron and heading home?\r\n\r\nEpisode 7\r\nThe Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, Series 3\r\nIt is dessert week in the Great British Bake Off tent and just six bakers remain.\r\nJoining host Jo Brand in the An Extra Slice studio are three celebrity Bake Off fans - double Olympic silver medalist Rebecca James, CrÃ¨me de la CrÃ¨me judge Cherish Finden and comedian Chris Addison. Jo and her guests dissect the latest goings on in the tent, taste the desserts the studio audience have brought along and look at pictures of viewer bakes from home, from the incredible to the frankly inedible. And Jo interviews the latest baker to leave the tent and reveals unseen footage from the BBC One show.\r\nWhat do the panel think of the bakers' attempts at this week's sweet signature? Did the right baker come top in the French dessert technical? And whose multi-bake mousse shone in the showstopper?\r\nThe Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice - when one helping of Bake Off just isn't enough","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98679becec11cb8972589afefb77ea422dc42df7","amp;dn":"T.G.British.Bake.Off-S07E07.-.Extra.Slice-S03E07--w.subs-540p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98679becec11cb8972589afefb77ea422dc42df7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,103,155,236,236,17,203,137,114,88,154,254,251,119,234,66,45,196,45,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
