A memo from J. Edgar Hoover himself states: &quot;American Army officials in Germany have not located Hitler's body nor is there any reliable source that will say definitely that Hitler is dead.&quot;\r\nWith these newly released FBI files as their guide, the team will approach this investigation in the hopes of solving the mystery surrounding the demise of one of the biggest criminals of all time. Whether they are investigating a mysterious Nazi lair deep in the Argentinian jungle or diving for evidence of a missing U-Boat that could of shuttled Hitler to South America, our team will focus on the tried and tested tactics for solving a fraudulent death case: follow the money, where was the subject last seen, eyewitness reports, make contact with known associates, and forensics.\r\nArmed with new clues and cutting edge technology, this crack team of investigators will uncover what Hitler's movements could have been after the fall of the Nazi Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  The Hunt Begins \r\nArmed with 700 pages of recently declassified FBI documents, twenty-one year CIA veteran Bob Baer and war crimes investigator Dr. John Cencich begin a worldwide investigation into what happened to Adolf Hitler at the end of WWII.
