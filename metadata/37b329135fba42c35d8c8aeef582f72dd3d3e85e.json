Get started quickly without being a 3D master by designing in 2D and easily transforming and animating in 3D. Fast, extremely lightweight, and simple-to-use APIs, along with 3D tools in AdobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® FlashÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® CS4 Professional software, make motion that was previously accessible only to expert users via ActionScriptÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® language or custom third-party libraries available to everyone.\n\nCustom filters and effects New\n\nCreate high-performance, real-time effects for cinematic experiences that quickly engage users. With new Adobe Pixel BenderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, the same technology behind many filters and effects in Adobe After EffectsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® software, these dynamic and interactive effects can be used both in production with After Effects CS4 and live with Flash Player 10. The Pixel Bender just-in- time (JIT) compiler can also be used to process other types of data, such as sound or mathematical functions, asynchronously in a separate thread.\n\nAdvanced text support New\n\nTake advantage of a new, flexible text engine that brings print-quality publishing to the web, building on more than 25 years of Adobe expertise in typography. Gain more control over text layout using the Text Layout Framework, an extensible library built on the new text engine in Adobe Flash Player 10, which delivers advanced, easy-to-integrate typographic and text layout features for rich, sophisticated and innovative typography on the web. Create multilingual web applications using device fonts that can now be anti-aliased, rotated, and styled, or build your own unique text components.\n\nDynamic sound generation New\n\nUse enhanced sound APIs to dynamically generate audio and create new types of audio applications such as music mixers and sequencers, real-time audio for games, and even audio visualizers. Work with loaded MP3 audio at a lower level by extracting audio data and supplying it to the sound buffer.\nProcess, filter, and mix audio in real time through the Pixel Bender JIT compiler to extend creative freedom beyond the visual experience.\n\nDrawing API Enhanced\n\nPerform runtime drawing more easily with restyleable properties, 3D APIs, and a new way of drawing sophisticated shapes without having to code them line by line. Developers can tweak parts of curves, change styling, replace parts, and use custom filters and effects, delivering improved throughput, creative control, and greater productivity. Enhancements to the Drawing API add the z dimension, real perspective, textured meshes in 3D space, a retained graphics model, read/write rendering, and triangle drawing with UV coordinates, while adding memory and improving performance. \n\nHardware acceleration Enhanced\n\nUse the hardware processing power of the graphics card to paint SWF files into the browser and accelerate compositing calculations of bitmaps, filters, blend modes, and video overlays faster than would be performed in software. \n\nVector data type New\n\nUse the new typed array class for better performance, efficiency, and error checking of data.\n\nDynamic Streaming New\n\nShow exceptional video with streams that automatically adjust to changing network conditions. Leverage new quality-of-service metrics to provide a better streaming experience. \n\nSpeex audio codec New\n\nTake advantage of the new, high-fidelity and open source Speex voice codec, which offers a low-latency alternative for voice encoding.\nFlash Player also supports ADPCM, HE-AAC, MP3, and Nellymoser audio.\n\nFile upload and download APIs Enhanced\n\nBring users into the experience by letting them load and save files from your web application. New file reference runtime access allows local processing of data without roundtripping to the server.\n\nColor correction New\n\nDeliver web applications with accurate color, so your favorite web destinations look the way they were intended. Color correction works with the monitor's ICC color profile and allows you to convert SWF files to standard RGB.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b329135fba42c35d8c8aeef582f72dd3d3e85e","amp;dn":"Adobe+Flash+Player+10.0.22.87","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b329135fba42c35d8c8aeef582f72dd3d3e85e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,179,41,19,95,186,66,195,93,140,138,238,245,130,247,45,211,211,232,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
