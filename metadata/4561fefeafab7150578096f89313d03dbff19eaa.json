Intended as a return to the roots of hip hop, the album was hailed as a classic soon after its release, and went on to ship Gold in sales.[1] The album's blend of socio-political rhymes with jazz and other unusual sources of samples endeared Mos Def to listeners uninterested in gangsta rap. This album also received 4 Mics from The Source's Five Mic Award.\n\n\nIf you like this torrent, please say thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4561fefeafab7150578096f89313d03dbff19eaa","amp;dn":"Mos+Def+-+Black+on+Both+Sides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4561fefeafab7150578096f89313d03dbff19eaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,97,254,254,175,171,113,80,87,128,150,248,147,19,208,61,191,241,158,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
