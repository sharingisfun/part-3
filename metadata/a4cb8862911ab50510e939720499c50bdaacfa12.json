Although sold as a thriller in the mould of McGoohan's previous series, Danger Man (called Secret Agent in its U.S. release), the show's combination of 1960s countercultural themes and surreal setting had a far-reaching effect on science fiction/fantasy programming, and on popular culture in general.\n\n\nA TV mini-series remake is slated to air on AMC in 2009, and Christopher Nolan has been widely reported to be considering a film version.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4cb8862911ab50510e939720499c50bdaacfa12","amp;dn":"The+Prisoner+-+The+Complete+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4cb8862911ab50510e939720499c50bdaacfa12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,203,136,98,145,26,181,5,16,233,57,114,4,153,197,11,218,172,250,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
