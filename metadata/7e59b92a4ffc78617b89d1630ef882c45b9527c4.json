Perry started working on forming the band shortly before his departure from Aerosmith in 1979. The Joe Perry Project signed a record deal almost immediately  with Aerosmith's label, Columbia Records, who were disappointed with the chaos in the Aerosmith camp and hoping to maneuver Perry back into Aerosmith.\r\n\r\n The original band line-up consisted of Perry, singer Ralph Morman, bassist David Hull and drummer Ronnie Stewart. This line-up recorded The Project's 1980 debut album, Let the Music Do the Talking. The album was fairly well received and sold a respectable 250,000 copies. \r\nHowever The Follow up I've Got the Rock'n'Rolls Again, proved to be less successful than the group's debut effort. Columbia's failure to promote the album combined with Perry's continuing drug and financial problems led to the entire band quitting in 1982.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a new label(MCA Records)better drugs and three new band members in singer Cowboy Mach Bell, bassist Danny Hargrove and drummer Joe Pet, the band released Once a Rocker, Always a Rocker in 1983. The album met the same fate as its predecessor, selling less than 50,000 copies. Despite the poor sales, The Project went out on a final tour in support of the album, adding then-former Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford to the line-up.\r\n\r\nThe following year, both Perry and Whitford would rejoin Aerosmith for a very successful reunion. And that settled that.\r\n    \r\nTITLE: Discography\r\n    \r\nDATE: 1980-2009\r\n    \r\nCOUNTRY: USA\r\n    \r\nSTYLE: Hard Rock, Heavy Blues Rock ,Classic Rock, Rock'n'Roll\r\n    \r\nDURATION:\t04:59:17\r\n    \r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n    \r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n1980 - Let The Music Do The Talking (The Joe Perry Project)\r\n\r\n1981 - I've Got The Rock 'N' Rolls Again (The Joe Perry Project)\r\n\r\n1983 - Once A Rocker, Always A Rocker (The Joe Perry Project)\r\n\r\n1999 - The Best Of: The Music Still Does The Talking (The Joe Perry Project)\r\n\r\n2005 - Joe Perry (Joe Perry)\r\n\r\n2009 - Have Guitar, Will Travel (Joe Perry)\r\n\r\nThe Players\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    Joe Perry â€“ lead guitar, vocals (1979â€“1984, 2009â€“present)\r\n    David Hull â€“ bass (1979â€“1982, 2009â€“present)\r\n    Hagen Grohe â€“ vocals (2009â€“present)\r\n    Paul Santo â€“ rhythm guitar, keyboards (2009â€“present)\r\n    Marty Richards â€“ drums (2009â€“present)\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\n1979 - 1980\r\nJoe Perry - lead guitar, vocals\r\nRalph Morman - vocals\r\nDavid Hull - bass\r\nRonnie Stewart - drums\r\n1980\r\nJoe Perry - lead guitar, vocals\r\nJoey Mala - rhythm guitar, vocals\r\nDavid Hull - bass\r\nRonnie Stewart - drums\r\n1980 - 1982\r\nJoe Perry - lead guitar, vocals\r\nCharlie Farren - rhythm guitar, vocals\r\nDavid Hull - bass\r\nRonnie Stewart - drums\r\n1982 - 1983\r\nJoe Perry - lead guitar, vocals\r\nCowboy Mach Bell - vocals\r\nDanny Hargrove - bass\r\nJoe Pet - drums\r\n1983 - 1984\r\nJoe Perry - lead guitar, vocals\r\nBrad Whitford - rhythm guitar\r\nCowboy Mach Bell - vocals\r\nDanny Hargrove - bass\r\nJoe Pet - drums\r\n1984 - 2009\r\nBand Split; Joe Perry and Brad Whitford rejoin Aerosmith.\r\n2009â€“Present\r\nJoe Perry - lead guitar, vocals\r\nHagen Grohe - vocals\r\nPaul Santo - rhythm guitar, keyboards\r\nDavid Hull - bass\r\nMarty Richards - drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e59b92a4ffc78617b89d1630ef882c45b9527c4","amp;dn":"The+Joe+Perry+Project+Discography+1980+-+2009+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e59b92a4ffc78617b89d1630ef882c45b9527c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,89,185,42,79,252,120,97,123,137,209,99,14,248,130,196,91,149,39,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
