It is CLEAN.\n\n2) After installing, I ran a full scan with Kaspersky AV 2014. It is CLEAN.\n\n\nImportant Notes About This Installation File\n=======================================================\nI tested installing this file on Windows 7 and also Windows 8. The only DRAWBACKS of this copy are:\n\n1) It will automatically install both 32-bit and 64-bit Photoshop without an option to choose from. It will produce 2 icons on the desktop. So I keep the one saying &quot;Photoshop CS6 x64&quot; and deleted the other one.\n\n2) There is no uninstall option. It will not add any uninstall entry under Windows' &quot;Programs and Features&quot;. To uninstall, simply delete the related folder.\n\n\nInstallation\n=======================================================\n\nThere is only one file to download:\n- Adobe Photoshop CS6 13.0.1 with AdobeCameraRaw_8.4_.exe\n\nSimply run this EXE file like an idiot (if you are not, do pretend like one). Throughout the installation process, you will only be prompted once - which folder to install the software to?\n\nIt is not necessary to patch anything or turn off your internet during installation. Also, no serial key to enter.\n\nUpon launching of PhotoShop, the &quot;Update&quot; selection will not be available under &quot;Help&quot;. For obvious reasons you cannot/should not update it.\n\n\nAbout Photoshop's Plug-In Folder\n=======================================================\nI was for a short while confused about its plug-in folder.\n\nIf you are using 64-bit, DO NOT install your third-party plug-ins to the ../PhotoShop CS6/plug-ins folder. It will not work unless you add an additional plug-in folder under PhotoShop &gt;&gt; Edit &gt;&gt; Preferences &gt;&gt; Plug-in.\n\nInstead, use the one at ../PhotoShop CS6/x64/plug-ins (assuming you are using the 64-bit version).\n\nI have tested installing NeatImage Pro 7, Topaz Adjust 4, Nik Collection, Imagenomic's Noiseware and Fluid Mask 3, all working fine.\n\n\nDisclaimer\n=======================================================\nThe PhotoShop exe file above was not created by me!\n\nIf it is working for you, please reply with the word &quot;HURRAY!&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:febc6e834434917a7a6eaa15eb886e717ffcf0ff","amp;dn":"Adobe+PhotoShop+CS6+Extended+v13.0.1+%2B+Camera+Raw+v8.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"febc6e834434917a7a6eaa15eb886e717ffcf0ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,188,110,131,68,52,145,122,122,110,170,21,235,136,110,113,127,252,240,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
