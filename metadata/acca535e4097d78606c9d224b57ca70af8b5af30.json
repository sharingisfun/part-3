To my westerner sensibility the aesthetic experience was akin to the fruition of Bach or Mozart: cathedral of sounds...\nIn the indian way... ragas... moods... scales... in hundreds of ways and permutations with the numeric dizziness so typical in the vedantic tradition.\n\nHe was one of the first (if not the very first) who tried to expand his music tradition to other cultures.\nHis collaborations with Harrison, Menuhin, Previn, Rampal, Glass (just to mention some) defined a matrix of art which innervates the contemporary scene of world music and nullifies boundaries between different cultures.\n\nIt was years that I mused to retrieve the most complete discography available for him.\nAnd I think I eventually made it.\nSo let me share this treasure to you all :)\n\nYou will find here 81 albums, solo and collaborations.\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums zips. Soundtracks are signed as &quot;ost&quot;...\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n1 - Solo\n\n1956 - Three Ragas\n1960 - Anuradha - ost\n1962 - Improvisations\n1962 - India's Most Distinguished Musician in Concert - 160\n1963 - India's Master Musician\n1964 - In London - 192\n1964 - Portrait of Genius\n1964 - Ragas &amp; Talas\n1966 - Chappaqua - ost\n1967 - In San Francisco - 192\n1967 - Live at the Monterrey Pop Festival\n1968 - A Morning Raga _ An Evening Raga\n1968 - Charly - ost\n1968 - In New York\n1968 - The Sounds of India\n1968 - Two Raga Moods - 192\n1970 - At The Woodstock Festival\n1970 - Ravi Shankar '70 [Parameshwari] - 160\n1971 - Four Raga Moods - 112\n1971 - Raga - ost - 224\n1973 - Transmigration Macabre\n1974 - Shankar Family &amp; Friends\n1976 - Music Festival from India\n1977 - Meera - ost\n1978 - Vision of Peace - The Art of Ravi Shankar\n1979 - Homage to Mahatma Gandhi\n1986 - Genesis - ost\n1986 - Pandit Ravi Shankar - VBR\n1987 - Tana Mana\n1989 - Inside the Kremlin\n1990 - Golden Jubilee Concert\n1990 - The Genius of Pandit Ravi Shankar - VBR\n1991 - Maestro's Choice - VBR\n1991 - Monument of Strings - VBR\n1991 - Unique\n1992 - The Doyen of Hindustani Music - VBR\n1995 - Concert for Peace - Royal Albert Hall, London\n1996 - In Celebration - 4CD\n1996 - In Celebration Highlights\n1996 - Towards The Rising Sun\n1997 - Chants Of India\n1997 - Raga Tala\n1998 - Ragas Varanasi - 192\n2000 - Four Ragas\n2000 - From Dusk to Dawn\n2000 - Full Circle at Carnegie Hall\n2001 - Master Of Sitar - VBR\n2002 - The Teacher - Key Works 1960 - 1985 - 192\n2003 - Bridges - The Best of Ravi Shankar\n2004 - A Journey\n2004 - The Rough Guide To Ravi Shankar - VBR\n2005 - Evening Ragas - Live at the  Royal Albert Hall\n2007 - 1948-59 - Vintage 78 RPM Records\n2007 - A Life in Music - VBR\n2010 - The Master (3CD Box Set)\n2010 - The Very Best of Ravi Shankar\n\n\nwith Ali Akbar Khan\n\n\t1964 - The Master Musicians of India\n\t1965 - Greatest Jugalbandies\n\t1968 - Live in San Francisco\n\t1972 - In Concert - 256\n\t1973 - Ragas\n\t1984 - Raga Mishra Piloo - Duet For Sitar &amp; Sarod\n\t1995 - From India\n\t2008 - More Flowers of India - VBR\n\n\nwith Alla Rakha\n\n\t1965 - Sound of The Sitar\n\t1979 - Ragas Hameer &amp; Gara\n\t1980 - Raga Jogeshwari\n        \n\nwith Daniel Hamrol\n\n\t1989 - The Encounter\n        \n\nwith George Fenton\n\n\t1982 - Gandhi - ost\n        \n\nwith George Harrison\n\n\t1971 - Concert for Bangladesh\n\t1974 - Fort Worth Express - 256\n\t2002 - East and West Yin and Yang\n\t2010 - Collaborations\n        \n\nwith Philip Glass\n\n\t1990 - Passages\n       \n\nwith Previn, Rampal and the London Symphony Orchestra\n\n\t1971 - Concerto for Sitar and Orchestra - 192\n        \n\nwith various authors\n\n\t1998 - Sitar Concertos and Other Works - VBR\n\t2002 - The Masterworks of Satyajit Ray\n\t2003 - Masters of Indian Classical Music - 256\n\t2009 - Ravi Shankar Presents The Master Drummers Of India\n\n\nwith Yehudi Menuhin\n\n\t1966 - West Meets East\n\t1999 - Raga-Mala - VBR\n\n\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/user/n0b0dyh0me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/user/n0b0dyh0me&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nfor private posts:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acca535e4097d78606c9d224b57ca70af8b5af30","amp;dn":"Ravi+Shankar+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acca535e4097d78606c9d224b57ca70af8b5af30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,202,83,94,64,151,215,134,6,201,210,36,181,124,167,10,248,181,175,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
