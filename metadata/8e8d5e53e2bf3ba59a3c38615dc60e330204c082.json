His success masks a painful childhood growing up under the heavy rule of an emotionally and physically abusive fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€a relationship that tormented him long into adulthood.\n\nWhen television producers in the UK approached him to appear on a popular celebrity genealogy show in 2010, Alan enthusiastically agreed. He hoped the show would solve a family mystery involving his maternal grandfather, a celebrated WWII hero who disappeared in the Far East. But as the truth of his family ancestors revealed itself, Alan learned far more than he bargained for about himself, his past, and his own father.\n\nWith ribald humor, wit, and incredible insight, Alan seamlessly moves back and forth in time, integrating stories from his childhood in Scotland and his experiences today as a film, television, and theater star. At times suspenseful, deeply moving, and wickedly funny, Not My FatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Son will make readers laugh even as it breaks their hearts.\n\nHardcover, 288 pages\nPublished October 7th 2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e8d5e53e2bf3ba59a3c38615dc60e330204c082","amp;dn":"Alan+Cumming+-+Not+My+Father%27s+Son%3A+A+Memoir+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e8d5e53e2bf3ba59a3c38615dc60e330204c082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,141,94,83,226,191,59,165,154,60,56,97,93,198,14,51,2,4,192,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
