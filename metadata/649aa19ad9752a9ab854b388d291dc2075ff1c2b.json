When I accidentally started my first mini habitÃ¢â‚¬â€and the changes I made were actually lastingÃ¢â‚¬â€I realized the \n\nprior strategies I relied on were complete failures. When something works, that which doesn't work is exposed. The science in Mini Habits exposes the predictably inconsistent \n\nresults of most popular personal growth strategies, and reveals why mini habits are consistent. \n\nA mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; a mini habit's &quot;too small to fail&quot; nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and \n\na superior habit-building strategy. \n\nMini Habits will better equip you to change your life than 99% of the people you see walking around on this globe. People so often think that they are the reason they can't \n\nachieve lasting change; but the problem isn't with themÃ¢â‚¬â€it's with their strategy. You can achieve great things without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated \n\nwith such strategies such as &quot;getting motivated,&quot; resolutions, or even &quot;just doing it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ To make changes last, you need to stop fighting against your brain. When you start \n\nplaying by your brain's rulesÃ¢â‚¬â€as mini habits show you how to doÃ¢â‚¬â€lasting change isn't so hard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:649aa19ad9752a9ab854b388d291dc2075ff1c2b","amp;dn":"Mini+Habits-+Smaller+Habits%2C+Bigger+Results+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"649aa19ad9752a9ab854b388d291dc2075ff1c2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,154,161,154,217,117,42,154,184,84,179,136,210,145,220,32,117,255,28,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
