Dubeau\r\nEnglish | 2016 | Science Fiction | 1.12 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nJF Dubeauâ€™s debut novel, The Life Engineered begins in the year 3594, where humanity is little more than a memoryâ€“a legend of the distant past destined to reappear. Capeks, a race of artificial creatures originally created by humans, have inherited the galaxy and formed a utopian civilization built on the shared goal of tirelessly working to prepare for their makersâ€™ return.\r\nOne moment a cop dying in the line of duty in Boston, the next â€œrebornâ€ as a Capek, Dagir must find her place in this intricate society. That vaguely remembered â€œdeathâ€ was but the last of hundreds of simulated lives, distilling her current personality. A robot built for rescue and repair, she finds her abilities tested immediately after her awakening when the large, sentient facility that created her is destroyed, marking the only instance of murder the peaceful Capeks have ever known. For the first time in their history, conflicting philosophies clash, setting off a violent civil war that could lay waste to the stars themselves.\r\nDagir sets off on a quest to find the killers, and finds much more than she sought. As the layers of the Capeksâ€™ past peel away to reveal their early origins, centuries-old truths come to light. And the resulting revelations may tear humanityâ€™s children apartâ€“and destroy all remnants of humankind.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e9d736fe60b2699d302348d7f36ccd5e3dc4159","amp;dn":"The+Life+Engineered+-+J-F.+Dubeau+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e9d736fe60b2699d302348d7f36ccd5e3dc4159","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,157,115,111,230,11,38,153,211,2,52,141,127,54,204,213,227,220,65,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
