The line-up is stellar, the program is terrific. A classic Prestige hard bop session.\n\n'The Cats' are John Coltrane, Kenny Burrell, Tommy Flanagan, and Idrees Sulieman. However, this recording is actually a showcase for Flanagan, a rising star in his first major role. Coltrane demonstrates that he would soon be exploring more harmonically advanced territories than the others, tearing through rapid-fire solos with no trouble whatsoever. Burrell takes a more laid-back approach, stringing together bluesy licks in a relaxed fashion.\n\nPlenty of tasty playing. Great stuff.\n\n\n\n\nTommy Flanagan / John Coltrane / Kenny Burrell / Idrees Sulieman\n\n The Cats\n\n Recorded in 1957, released in 1959\n\n\n \n\n     CD / 2013 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\n\n Tracklist:\n\n 1.
