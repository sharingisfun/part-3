This gives you and apps that take \nadvantage of the root permissions more control over the Android operating system and the device. Rooting can be entertaining for techies, but there are also plenty of practical benefits.\n\nBefore rooting, you should understand the two main risks. For starters, rooting can void your phoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s factory and/or service provider warranty in many cases. \nHowever, most rooting applications and methods can be easily reverted. Additionally, if the rooting process doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t complete correctly it could damage the software. This would require a factory recover, causing all data on the phone (contacts, apps, media) to be lost, or it may even render your device useless, to \nthe point where it canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be saved unless examined by a technician. However, if you follow the instructions for the rooting method you use carefully, you shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a problem. Of course, before attempting any sort of root or jailbreak, make sure your phoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s data is backed up.\n\nThis method does not wipe ANY data, contacts, texts, apps etc.\nIncluded in the rar are two files: The VRoot installation necessary to root your phone and a video detailing the changes necessary to your rooted phone afterwards. VRoot is probably china's most popular method of rooting since it's a simple one click solution. Although VRoot works very well, it installs a chinese version of Superuser, hence the video to explain how to simply replace it and update it with the english version. Took me 10 minutes to root my Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini and update it. IF your phone can be rooted by this method, it can also be unrooted using the same app.\n\nREAD the included Installation.txt file.\n\nThat's it, have fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f1960d6e3dd5d79626b78eb81490852342776d","amp;dn":"Android+4.12+Jelly+Bean+Root+%28Universal+Method%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f1960d6e3dd5d79626b78eb81490852342776d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,241,150,13,110,61,213,215,150,38,183,142,184,20,144,133,35,66,119,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
