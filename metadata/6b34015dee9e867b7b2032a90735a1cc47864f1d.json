The group was considered one of the leaders of the thrash metal scene during the 1980s. When the genre's popularity increased, Anthrax was one of its &quot;big four&quot; with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. As of 2014 the band has released ten studio albums, a number of singles and an EP with American hip hop group Public Enemy. According to Nielsen SoundScan Anthrax sold 2.5 million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, with worldwide sales of over 15 million.\n\nAnthrax are set to unleash their new live DVD, the awesomely titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœChile on Hell,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ on Sept. 16.

You never know, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the thing about doing these kind of DVD shoots. The only thing we were able to have a guarantee on was how great the crowd was going to be, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why we did it in Chile.\n\nYear: 2014\nCountry: United States\nGenre: Thrash Metal\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 256Kbps\n\nTRACKLIST:\n01.
