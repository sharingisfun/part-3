Here, in his most ambitious and stunning work yet, he rejects the long-standing idea that consciousness is somehow separate from the body, and presents compelling new scientific evidence that posits an evolutionary perspective. His view entails a radical change in the way the history of the conscious mind is viewed and told, suggesting that the brainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development of a human self is a challenge to natureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s indifference. This development helps to open the way for the appearance of culture, perhaps one of our most defining characteristics as thinking and self-aware beings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3821af494788ddca6a4397adb9fef20df1cb1b34","amp;dn":"Self+Comes+to+Mind+Constructing+the+Conscious+Brain+by+Antonio+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3821af494788ddca6a4397adb9fef20df1cb1b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,33,175,73,71,136,221,202,106,67,151,173,185,254,242,13,241,203,27,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
