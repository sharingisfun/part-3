Strategists, managers, designers, and researchers who undertake the challenge of innovation, despite a lack of established procedures and a high risk of failure, will find this an invaluable resource. Novices can learn from it; managers can plan with it; and practitioners of innovation can improve the quality of their work by referring to it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c88ff96c754ca63e35f3dae5924f97cae65db87","amp;dn":"101+Design+Methods%3A+A+Structured+Approach+for+Driving+Innovation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c88ff96c754ca63e35f3dae5924f97cae65db87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,136,255,150,199,84,202,99,227,95,61,174,89,36,249,124,174,101,219,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
