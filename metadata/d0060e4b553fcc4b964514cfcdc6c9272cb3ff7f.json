Roth\n\nEnglish | 2014 | ISBN: 1482247062 | 229 pages | PDF | 1,6 MB\n\nDuring the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decades of experience consulting in the corporate world and teaching management theory at the university level, he has often questioned many modern-day management practices.\n\nFor example, why do so many companies have evaluation and reward systems that force employees to compete against each other while these same organizations preach the gospel of cooperation and teamwork? Why do companies continue to downsize when this practice has proven antithetical to long-term success?\n\nOut of the Box Thinking for Successful Managers explains, in a user-friendly and sometimes humorous manner, why these practices are based on worn-out logic in some cases and complete falsehoods in others. Questioning numerous management practices that have been popular for decades, it details their weaknesses and explains why they continue to hamper attempts to improve productivity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0060e4b553fcc4b964514cfcdc6c9272cb3ff7f","amp;dn":"Out+of+the+Box+Thinking+for+Successful+Managers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0060e4b553fcc4b964514cfcdc6c9272cb3ff7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,6,14,75,85,63,204,75,150,69,20,207,205,198,201,39,44,179,255,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
