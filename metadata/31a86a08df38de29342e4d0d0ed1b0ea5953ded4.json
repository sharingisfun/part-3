Equal parts powerful family saga, forbidden love story, and piercing political drama, \n\nit is the story of an affluent Indian family forever changed by one fateful day in 1969. The seven-year-old twins Estha and Rahel see their world shaken irrevokably by the arrival of their beautiful young cousin, Sophie. It is an event that will lead to an illicit liaison and tragedies accidental and intentional, exposing Ã¢â‚¬Å“big things [that] lurk unsaidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a country drifting dangerously toward unrest. \n\nLush, lyrical, and unnerving, The God of Small Things is an award-winning landmark that started for its author an esteemed career of fiction and political commentary that continues unabated.\n\nAudio CD\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 000725802X\nISBN-13: 978-0007258024\nProduct Dimensions: 4.7 x 5.7 inches\nShipping Weight: 6.4 ounces\n\nWritten by Arundhati Roy \nRead by Diana Quick \nFormat: MP3 @ 128kbps\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
