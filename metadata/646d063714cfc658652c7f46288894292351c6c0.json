Goya was famed for the quality and speed at which he executed his drawings, and his etchings are of extraordinary delicacy. His use of chiaroscuro in his dark, intense paintings influenced many artists, including Manet. This monograph, with text by Sarah Carr-Gomm, presents the essential works of this pioneering artist, today considered the father of modern art.
