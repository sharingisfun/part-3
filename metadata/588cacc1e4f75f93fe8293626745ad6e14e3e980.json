We know the statistics, but what does it feel like to be forced to turn to foodbanks for help? What does it take to get emergency food, and what's in the food parcel? Kayleigh Garthwaite conducted hundreds of hours of interviews while working in a Trussell Trust foodbank. She spoke to people like Anna and her 11 year old daughter Daisy who were eating out of date food since Anna left her job due to mental health problems. Glen explained the shame he felt using the foodbank having taken on a zero hours contract. Pregnant Jessica walked two miles to the foodbank because she couldn't afford public transport. This provocative book provides a much needed voice for foodbank users and volunteers in the UK, and a powerful insight into the realities of foodbank use from the inside","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:588cacc1e4f75f93fe8293626745ad6e14e3e980","amp;dn":"Hunger+Pains+-+Life+Inside+Foodbank+Britain+%282016%29+%28Pdf%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"588cacc1e4f75f93fe8293626745ad6e14e3e980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,140,172,193,228,247,95,147,254,130,147,98,103,69,173,110,20,227,233,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
