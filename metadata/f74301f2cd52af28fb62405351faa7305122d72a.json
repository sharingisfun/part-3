But he is remarkably \r\nunfulfilled in his life, something he does not tell anyone. On March 10, \r\n1935, he is in Baskul, China, where a violent revolution is taking place. \r\nIt is his job to evacuate the ninety British subjects in the area, before \r\nhe himself heads back to London to become British Foreign Secretary. He is \r\nable to complete the evacuation, with him, his overly pragmatic brother \r\nGeorge Conway, palaeontologist Alexander Lovett (a fussbudget of a man), \r\nsecretive Henry Barnard (who later states why he is so secretive about \r\nhimself), and terminally ill American Gloria Stone his fellow passengers \r\non the last flight out. What they are initially unaware of is that the \r\nplane has been hijacked, and eventually crash lands high in the Himalayas, \r\nkilling the hijacking pilot. But instead of what seems a probable death for \r\nthem, they are rescued by a band of men who take them back to their \r\ncommunity hidden behind the mountains, a seemingly Utopian community named \r\nShangrila, where the overall belief is to be kind. Ageing is also a seemingly \r\nunknown concept. Each of the five has different feelings about their new \r\nsanctuary, where they eventually learn they were not brought by accident. \r\nOn one end of the spectrum is George, who does whatever he can to get back \r\nto civilization as he knows it, despite the probable hardship of doing so, \r\nespecially since there is no means of communication in and out. He believes \r\nwhat they have been told are all lies and that they are being held prisoners \r\nagainst their will. On the other end is Bob, who believes that Shangrila is \r\nexactly what he's been looking for in life. With no proof one way or another, \r\nthe five have differing views of staying in Shangrila forever or trying to \r\nmake their way out. It may be not until they receive that &quot;proof&quot; that a \r\ndefinitive decision can be made, but by that time it may be too late \r\nfor some.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Ronald Colman.\r\n=&gt;-Edward Everett Horton.\r\n=&gt;-Jane Wyatt.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Frank Capra.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Mystery : Adventure : Drama : Classic.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1937.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.54 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 661 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 13mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters...................: 28 Named.\r\n=&gt;-Lost Horizon 1937..........: http://www.imdb.com/title//\r\n=&gt;-Lost Horizon 1937..........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lost_horizon/\r\n=&gt;-Lost Horizon 1937..........: http://www.filmsite.org/losth.html/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 4:3.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 960 x 720.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 530 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 125 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 162 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f74301f2cd52af28fb62405351faa7305122d72a","amp;dn":"Lost+Horizon+-+Classic+Adventure+1937+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f74301f2cd52af28fb62405351faa7305122d72a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,67,1,242,205,82,175,40,251,98,64,83,81,250,167,48,81,34,215,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
