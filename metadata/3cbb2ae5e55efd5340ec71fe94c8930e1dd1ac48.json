He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember anything before waking up in a bus full of kids on a field trip. Apparently he has a girlfriend named Piper and a best friend named Leo. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all students at a boarding school for Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad kids.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ What did Jason do to end up here? And where is here, exactly?\n\nPiper has a secret. Her father has been missing for three days, ever since she had that terrifying nightmare. Piper doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand her dream, or why her boyfriend suddenly doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recognize her. When a freak storm hits, unleashing strange creatures and whisking her, Jason, and Leo away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood, she has a feeling sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to find out.\n\nLeo has a way with tools. When he sees his cabin at Camp Half-Blood, filled with power tools and machine parts, he feels right at home. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weird stuff, tooÃ¢â‚¬â€like the curse everyone keeps talking about. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist that each of themÃ¢â‚¬â€including LeoÃ¢â‚¬â€is related to a god.\n\n\n\n                           Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                           Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n            Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n \n              &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cbb2ae5e55efd5340ec71fe94c8930e1dd1ac48","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Hero+by+Rick+Riordan+%28Heroes+of+Olympus+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cbb2ae5e55efd5340ec71fe94c8930e1dd1ac48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,187,42,229,229,94,253,83,64,236,113,254,148,200,147,14,29,209,172,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
