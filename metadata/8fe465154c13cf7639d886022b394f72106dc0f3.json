This book is something of a sequel to her acclaimed and much-beloved interior design book, An Affair with a House, this time taking Williams's Punta Cana retreat, La Colina, as its subject. Designed and custom-built by Williams and noted antiques collector and dealer John Rosselli, La Colina is a colonial villa tucked into lush, tropical gardens by the Carribean sea. The book explores and celebrates every facet of the property; from outdoor rooms, garden plantings and design, to the glorious, island-living luxury of the villa's interiors, furnishings and collections. Content is divided into three sections; Welcome, Social Spaces and Private Places, all offering Williams s invaluable insights and wonderful approach to decor and design. Woven into each section are essays written by friends who have visited the property: Gil Shafer details the villa's architecture; Page Dickey offers a personal and intimate look at the gardens; Angus Wilkie discusses the delights of collecting; and Jane Garmey revels in the pleasures of cooking, food and friends. This an interior design book like no other, delightful and personal, filled with stories, anecdotes, and beautiful, never-before-published photos, and brimming with essential design and entertaining advice that readers will return to again and again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe465154c13cf7639d886022b394f72106dc0f3","amp;dn":"A+House+by+the+Sea+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe465154c13cf7639d886022b394f72106dc0f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,228,101,21,76,19,207,118,57,216,134,2,43,57,79,114,16,109,192,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
