Flamboyant frontman Perry Farrell, formerly of the band Psi Com, had an undeniable charisma and an interest in provocative art (he designed the band's album covers), and Jane's Addiction played a hybrid of rock music: metal with strains of punk, folk, and jazz. The quartet, comprised of Farrell, bassist Eric Avery, drummer Stephen Perkins, and guitarist Dave Navarro, had already released its debut album as well, in the form of a live recording from the Roxy in Hollywood. Finally, Warner Bros. won the bidding war and released Nothing's Shocking in 1988. The band's abrasive sound and aggressive attitude (typified by the nude sculpture on the cover) led to some resistance, but Jane's Addiction began to break through to an audience -- the album spent 35 weeks on the charts. \n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nJane's Addiction (1987)\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.90% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tTriple X Records\nCatalog:\t\t51004-2\n\n\nNothing's Shocking (1988)\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.82% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner\nCatalog:\t\tW2 25727\n\n\nRitual De Lo Habitual (1990)\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner\nCatalog:\t\t25993-2\n\n\nClassic Girl EP (1991)\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner\nCatalog:\t\t9 40129-2\n\n\nKettle Whistle (1997)\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.93% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner\nCatalog:\t\t9 46752-2\n\n\nStrays (2003)\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.73% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol\nCatalog:\t\tCDP 7243 5 90186 0 7\n\n\nA Cabinet Of Curiosities 3CD (2009)\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.76% CDDA, 99.83% CDDA, 99.86% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\t8122-79909-9\n\n\nThe Great Escape Artist (2011)\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.90% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol\nCatalog:\t\t65112\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c95f4d07831003d39d7ad5c124ef15e23a4d05d3","amp;dn":"Jane%27s+Addiction+-+Discography+%281987-2011%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c95f4d07831003d39d7ad5c124ef15e23a4d05d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,95,77,7,131,16,3,211,157,122,213,193,36,239,21,226,58,77,5,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
