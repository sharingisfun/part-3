It was published by MicroProse in 1994 for the PC DOS and Amiga computers and the Amiga CD32 console, and in 1995 for the PlayStation. Its European PlayStation release is titled X-COM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nOriginally planned by Julian Gollop as a sequel to Target Games' 1988 Laser Squad, the game mixes real-time management simulation with turn-based tactics. The player takes the role of commander of X-COM - a clandestine, international paramilitary organization defending Earth from alien invasion. Through the game, the player is tasked with issuing orders to individual X-COM troops in a series of turn-based tactical missions. At strategic scale, the player directs the research and development of new technologies, builds and expands X-COM's bases, manages the organization's finances and personnel, and monitors and responds to UFO activity.\n\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nExtract\nRun 'XCOM UFO DEFENSE.BAT'\nProfit???\n\n\n\nTested on:\n\nWindows 7 x86 &amp; x64\nWindows XP x86 &amp; X64\n\n\nif you like the software buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/7760/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/7760/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamersgate.com/DD-XCOMUD/x-com-ufo-defence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamersgate.com/DD-XCOMUD/x-com-ufo-defence&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nshouts to all the classic gamers! retro is the only way foward","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1178457a6c4ef9c62325afcdb267932364f3c64","amp;dn":"X-Com%3A+UFO+Defense%5BPC%5D%5BWin7.x86.x64%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1178457a6c4ef9c62325afcdb267932364f3c64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,23,132,87,166,196,239,156,98,50,90,252,219,38,121,50,54,79,60,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
