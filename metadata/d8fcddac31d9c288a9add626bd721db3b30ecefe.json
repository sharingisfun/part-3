With so much bogus information coming from so many sources, how can anyone be expected to discover the truth?\n\n In Debunk It, author John Grant uses modern, ripped-from-the-headlines examples to clearly explain how to identify bad evidence and poor arguments. He provides a roundup of the rhetorical tricks people use when attempting to pull the wool over our eyes, and even offers advice about how to take these unscrupulous pundits down. So if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re tired of hearing blowhards spouting off about climate change, history, evolution, medicine, and more, this is the book for you. Debunk It is the ultimate guide for young readers seeking a firmer footing in a world thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full of holes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8fcddac31d9c288a9add626bd721db3b30ecefe","amp;dn":"Debunk+It%21%3A+How+to+Stay+Sane+in+a+World+of+Misinformation%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8fcddac31d9c288a9add626bd721db3b30ecefe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,252,221,172,49,217,194,136,169,173,214,38,189,114,29,179,179,14,206,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
