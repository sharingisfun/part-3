M. Forster set against the backdrop of the British Raj and the Indian independence movement in the 1920s. It was selected as one of the 100 great works of English literature by the Modern Library and won the 1924 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. Time magazine included the novel in its &quot;100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;. The novel is based on Forster's experiences in India. E.M. Forster borrowed the book's title from Walt Whitman's poem of the same name in Leaves of Grass.\n\nThe story revolves around four characters: Dr. Aziz, his British friend Mr. Cyril Fielding, Mrs. Moore, and Miss Adela Quested. During a trip to the Marabar Caves (modeled on the Barabar Caves of Bihar), Adela accuses Aziz of attempting to assault her. Aziz's trial, and its run-up and aftermath, bring out all the racial tensions and prejudices between indigenous Indians and the British colonists who rule India.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8985eb3af8535f9dcf0ac1a44cd8a73a157e7a3","amp;dn":"A+Passage+to+India+-+E.+M.+Forster.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8985eb3af8535f9dcf0ac1a44cd8a73a157e7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,152,94,179,175,133,53,249,220,240,172,26,68,205,138,115,161,87,231,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
