It is the follow-up to 2009's Invaders Must Die and was released on 30 March 2015 (and for Friday-release countries is on 27 March 2015). The album will be released by Three Six Zero Music/Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The first single, &quot;Nasty&quot;, was announced on the band's Instagram and Facebook pages on 29 December 2014 \n\nThe album title is a reference to the Cole Porter song &quot;All Through the Night&quot;, in particular its lyrics &quot;the day is my enemy, the night my friend&quot;, although it is the Ella Fitzgerald version that first inspired the title track. On 26 January 2015 the band released the official audio for the title track &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot; on their official YouTube channel. On 23 February 2015 the band released the official music video for the third single &quot;Wild Frontier&quot;.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Recording\n    2 Composition\n    3 Reception\n    4 Track listing\n    5 Personnel\n   \n\n\n\nThe album's title track was the last track to be produced for the album. In an interview with with BBC Radio 6 Music, Howlett mentioned that the idea of the track came about when one of his friends, Olly Burden, had presented Howlett with a guitar riff he had made, which would eventually serve as the main basis for the track. Howlett got an idea for a track and asked for the riff's use during the production, with him finding the results good enough to serve as an album opener. The track also includes additional drumming performance provided by the Switzerland based drum corps, Top Secret Drum Corps.\n\nThe song &quot;Ibiza&quot; (featuring Sleaford Mods) is a critique of the superstar DJ culture. Howlett explained that &quot;we did a gig in Ibiza, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not a great fan of the place, but it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an attack on the island, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an attack on these mindless fucking jokers that arrive in their Learjets, pull a USB stick out of their pockets, plug it in and wave their hands in the air to a pre-programmed mix&quot;.\nReception\n\n\n\nAllMusic found that the band-focused approach benefited several tracks on the album, but overall criticized the general length of the album, finding that at 14 tracks it is &quot;built for returning fan club members and not the EP-craving EDM crowd&quot;. In a more scathing review, Drowned in Sound echoed similar criticisms, claiming that the band &quot;embraces their psycho circus shtick to the point of suffocation&quot;.\nTrack listing\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength \t\n\n1.\t&quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Nasty&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Rebel Radio&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Ibiza&quot; (featuring Sleaford Mods)\n5.\t&quot;Destroy&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Wild Frontier&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Rok-Weiler&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Beyond the Deathray&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Rhythm Bomb&quot; (featuring Flux Pavilion)\n10.\t&quot;Roadblox&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Get Your Fight On&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Medicine&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Invisible Sun&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Wall of Death&quot;  \n\nThe Prodigy\n\n    Liam Howlett Ã¢â‚¬â€œ production, writing, keyboards, synthesizers, sampling, programming, engineering, mixing; additional voices on &quot;Wall of Death&quot;\n    Keith Flint Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals on &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Rebel Radio&quot;, &quot;Ibiza&quot;, &quot;Rok-Weiler&quot;, &quot;Get Your Fight On&quot;, &quot;Invisible Sun&quot;, &quot;Wall of Death&quot;, writing on &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Rok-Weiler&quot;, &quot;Wall of Death&quot;\n    Maxim Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals on &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot;, &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Rebel Radio&quot;, &quot;Wild Frontier&quot;, &quot;Roadblox&quot;, &quot;Get Your Fight On&quot;, &quot;Medicine&quot;, &quot;Wall of Death&quot;, writing on &quot;Roadblox&quot;, &quot;Get Your Fight On&quot;, &quot;Medicine&quot;\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n    Neil McLellan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing on &quot;Beyond the Deathray&quot;, co-production (all), engineering (all), mixing (all)\n    Martina Topley-Bird Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional vocals on &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot;\n    Paul &quot;Dirtcandy&quot; Jackson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional vocals on &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot;\n    Top Secret Drum Corps Ã¢â‚¬â€œ live drums on &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot;\n    Simon &quot;Brother Culture&quot; Fajemisin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional vocals on &quot;Nasty&quot; and &quot;Rebel Radio&quot;, additional writing on &quot;Rebel Radio&quot;\n    Tim Hutton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ background vocals on &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Rebel Radio&quot;, &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; and &quot;Invisible Sun&quot;, and additional writing on &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Rebel Radio&quot;, &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; and &quot;Get Your Fight On&quot;\n    Black Futures (Stuart Henshall, Vincent Welch, Paul Frazer) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing on &quot;Rebel Radio&quot; and &quot;Rok-Weiler&quot;, co-production on &quot;Rok-Weiler&quot;\n    Jason Williamson of Sleaford Mods Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals and additional writing on &quot;Ibiza&quot;\n    KillSonik (Joe Erskine &amp; Luca Gulotta) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing and production on &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; and &quot;Get Your Fight On&quot;\n    Zak H Laycock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing and production on &quot;Destroy&quot;\n    Rob Holliday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar on &quot;Rok-Weiler&quot;\n    Joshua &quot;Flux Pavilion&quot; Steele Ã¢â‚¬â€œ co-writing and co-production on &quot;Rhythm Bomb&quot;\n    Mark &quot;YT&quot; Hull Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals and additional writing on &quot;Medicine&quot;\n    Cole Porter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ writing on &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot; (incorporating elements of his original song &quot;All Through The Night&quot;)\n    Olly Burden Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing on &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot; and &quot;Wall of Death&quot;\n    Nick Halkes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing on &quot;Nasty&quot;, &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; and &quot;Get Your Fight On&quot;\n    Cheri Williams of Jomanda Ã¢â‚¬â€œ original female vocals and additional writing on &quot;Rhythm Bomb&quot; (sample taken from &quot;Jomanda Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Make My Body Rock 1990&quot;)\n    Dwayne Richardson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing on &quot;Rhythm Bomb&quot; (sample taken from &quot;Jomanda Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Make My Body Rock 1990&quot;)\n    Jari Salo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing on &quot;Get Your Fight On&quot; (sample taken from &quot;Pepe DeluxÃƒÂ© Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Salami Fever&quot;)\n    Paul MalmstrÃƒÂ¶m Ã¢â‚¬â€œ additional writing on &quot;Get Your Fight On&quot; (sample taken from &quot;Pepe DeluxÃƒÂ© Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Salami Fever&quot;)\n    The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster Ã¢â‚¬â€œ writing on &quot;Rise Of The Eagles&quot;\n    John Davis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mastering (at Metropolis Mastering)\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
