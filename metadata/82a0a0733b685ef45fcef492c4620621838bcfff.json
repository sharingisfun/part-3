In contrast, little is graceful and daddy is not dear in Julien&amp;#039;s world. His father listens to blues wearing a gas mask; dad prods, lectures, and derides Julien as well as Julien&amp;#039;s brother and pregnant sister, while grandma attends to her dog. Julien is different, schizophrenic. He wears gold teeth. He bowls, sings, worships, and chats with a group of young adults with disabilities. His sister&amp;#039;s child is probably his own. He talks on the phone, imagining it&amp;#039;s his mother, who died in childbirth years before. He may be a murderer of children. From his point of view (perhaps), the film follows this odd family for a few weeks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a0a0733b685ef45fcef492c4620621838bcfff","amp;dn":"Julien+Donkey+Boy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a0a0733b685ef45fcef492c4620621838bcfff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,160,160,115,59,104,94,244,95,206,244,146,196,98,6,33,131,139,207,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
