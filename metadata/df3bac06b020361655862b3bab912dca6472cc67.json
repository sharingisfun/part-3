This is a more sophisticated and mature Callahan release than his previous work, featuring more instrumental depth and layering than his signature simple, repetitive, stripped back sound. CallahanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deep baritone vocals and unemotional delivery provide a haunting element to the tracks. Lyrically he explores themes such as relationships, religion and nature, but does so in a stoic, pragmatic manner. The songs are not structured in a logical verse/chorus format but instead follow a stream of consciousness path, often in a conversational narrative style. His religious ponderings and menace have, for me, something of Nick Cave about them. While his dark, quavering vocals summon the sounds of Leonard Cohen or Lou Reed.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3bac06b020361655862b3bab912dca6472cc67","amp;dn":"Bill+Callahan+-+Sometimes+I+Wish+We+Were+An+Eagle+%5Bmp3-320-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3bac06b020361655862b3bab912dca6472cc67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,59,172,6,176,32,54,22,85,134,43,59,171,145,45,202,100,114,204,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
