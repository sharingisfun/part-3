We're not cavemen anymore, so why should we follow a strict caveman diet? \n\nIn YOUR PERSONAL PALEO CODE, Chris Kresser uses the Paleo diet as a baseline from which you can tailor the ideal three-step program-Reset, Rebuild, Revive-to fit your lifestyle, \n\nbody type, genetic blueprint, and individual needs. Kresser helps further personalize your prescription for specific health conditions, from heart disease and high blood \n\npressure to thyroid disorders and digestive problems.

Based \n\non cutting-edge scientific research, YOUR PERSONAL PALEO CODE is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, with helpful charts, quizzes, and effective action steps to help you \n\nlose weight, reverse disease, and stay fit and healthy for life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d45faddcfb0f63db20eb2ee99d960924798d326","amp;dn":"Your+Personal+Paleo+Code-+Chris+Kresser+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d45faddcfb0f63db20eb2ee99d960924798d326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,69,250,221,207,176,246,61,178,14,178,238,153,217,96,146,71,152,211,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
