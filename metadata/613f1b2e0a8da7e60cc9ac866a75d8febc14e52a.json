There are brief biographies of dance and ballet figues of the far past and present until 1977. These are terse but well written and often accompanied by a photo. It is fascinating just to leaf through the pages and read of these people. There are entries for dancers, composers, choreographers and designers that have made the great art that ballet is today. There is also brief synopsis of most of the notable ballets of the past and those still in repertory. This is a very valuable resource for anyone interested in modern dance and ballet. Unfortunately this book was compiled and published over thirty years ago and is very out of date. I have not found a suitable comparable volume that is newer. I do hope someone or more people take on this very large but needed task of updating this encyclopedia.
