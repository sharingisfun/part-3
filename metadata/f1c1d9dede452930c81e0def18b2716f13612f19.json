With crushing epic doom spanning eight tracks, and featuring the return of original guitarist Calvin Robertshaw to the fold, this is undoubtedly amongst the band's heaviest, darkest, and most majestic works to date, marking MY DYING BRIDE's 25th anniversary in punishing style, with the title track also set to feature as the album's debut video.\n\n&quot;Feel The Misery&quot; sees a notable return to the band's old haunt, Academy Studios in Dewsbury West Yorkshire, for recording, where all of MY DYING BRIDE's classic early albums were produced. Mixing once more takes place at Futureworks in Manchester, U.K. with the band's longtime studio engineer/producer Rob &quot;Mags&quot; Magoolagan.\n\nThe band comments on the themes of &quot;Feel The Misery&quot;: &quot;Contained within are all the grandeur and mastery of the melancholic one would expect to find on a recording from this group of musicians. The crushing of hearts and the solemn farewells to friends and lovers twinned with the destruction of flesh and the passions of cruelty are laid neatly for the listener to devour and savor. Eight new compositions detailing the path of life through dark doors and the burdens we all must endure simply to make it to the end, MY DYING BRIDE have returned with a foreboding new album which may enlighten, delight and consume the soul in one epic sitting.&quot;\n&quot;Feel The Misery&quot; track listing:\n\n\n\n01. And My Father Left Forever\n02. To Shiver In Empty Halls\n03. A Cold New Curse\n04. Feel The Misery\n05. A Thorn Of Wisdom\n06. I Celebrate Your Skin\n07. I Almost Loved You\n08.
