She also wrote romances under the name Mary Westmacott, but she is best remembered for her 66 detective novels and more than 15 short story collections (especially those featuring Hercule Poirot or Miss Jane Marple), and her successful West End plays.\nAccording to the Guinness Book of World Records, Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly four billion copies, and her estate claims that her works rank third, after those of William Shakespeare and the Bible, as the most widely published books. According to Index Translationum, Christie is the most translated individual author, with only the collective corporate works of Walt Disney Productions surpassing her. Her books have been translated into at least 103 languages\n\nWhile the Light Lasts**\nUnexpected Guest**\nThe Hound of Death**\nThe Adventure of the Christmas Pudding and Other Stories**\nProblem at Pollensa Bay**\nMiss Marple: The Complete Short Stories**\nListerdale Mystery**\nHercule Poirot's Early Cases**\nHercule Poirot's Casebook**\nAn Autobiography **\nThe ABC Murders \nMurder on the Orient Express\nThe Murder at the Vicarage\nThe Regatta Mystery and Other Stories: Featuring Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, and Mr. Parker Pyne\nThe Body in the Library\nThe Moving Finger\nA Murder Is Announced: A Miss Marple Mystery\nThey Do It With Mirrors\nA Pocket Full of Rye\n4:50 From Paddington\nThe Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side: A Miss Marple Mystery\nA Caribbean Mystery: A Miss Marple Mystery\nAt Bertram's Hotel\nNemesis\nSleeping Murder: Miss Marple's Last Case\nThe Thirteen Problems\nMiss Marple's Final Cases: And Two Other Stories\nTowards Zero\nThe Seven Dials Mystery\nThe Secret of Chimneys\nMurder Is Easy\nThe Secret Adversary: A Tommy &amp; Tuppence Adventure\nPostern of Fate\nBy the Pricking of My Thumbs:\nN or M?\nPartners in Crime: A Tommy &amp; Tuppence Adventure\nParker Pyne Investigates: A Short Story Collection\nThe Pale Horse\nThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\nThe Murder on the Links: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nPoirot Investigates: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nThe Big Four: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nThe Mystery of the Blue Train: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nPeril at End House\nLord Edgware Dies: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nThree Act Tragedy: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nDeath in the Clouds: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nCurtain: Poirot's Last Case: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nElephants Can Remember\nHallowe'en Party: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nThird Girl\nThe Clocks: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nCat Among the Pigeons: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nDead Man's Folly: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nHickory Dickory Dock: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nAfter the Funeral: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nMrs. McGinty's Dead: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nTaken at the Flood: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nThe Labours of Hercules: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nThe Hollow: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nFive Little Pigs: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nEvil Under the Sun: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nOne, Two, Buckle My Shoe: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nSad Cypress: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nHercule Poirot's Christmas: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nAppointment With Death: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nMurder in the Mews: Four Cases of Hercule Poirot\nDumb Witness: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nDeath on the Nile: Hercule Poirot Investigates\nMurder in Mesopotamia\nCards on the Table: A Hercule Poirot Mystery\nThree Blind Mice and Other Stories\nThe Witness for the Prosecution and Other Stories\nDouble Sin and Other Stories\nThe Under Dog and Other Stories\nThe Golden Ball and Other Stories\nBlack Coffee\nThe Unexpected Guest\nSpider's Web\nWhy Didn't They Ask Evans?\nPassenger to Frankfurt\nThe Harlequin Tea Set and Other Stories\nThe Mysterious Mr. Quin: A Short Story Collection\nDestination Unknown\nDeath Comes as the End\nOrdeal by Innocence\nThe Sittaford Mystery\nThey Came to Baghdad\nEndless Night\nSparkling Cyanide\nThe Man in the Brown Suit\nCrooked House\nAnd Then There Were None\n\nAll Books are full Retail unless noted by the 2 stars (**) which aren't available in retailed digital format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a188499364e311feffccebeba4df5d04e276fbbe","amp;dn":"Agatha+Christie+Bibliography+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a188499364e311feffccebeba4df5d04e276fbbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,136,73,147,100,227,17,254,255,204,235,235,164,223,93,4,226,118,251,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
