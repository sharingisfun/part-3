Born Alecia Moore on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, Pink received her nickname as a child, years before she dyed her hair accordingly. She grew up in a musical family and was a regular on the Philadelphia club scene by the age of 13, first as a dancer and then as a backing vocalist for the local hip-hop group Schoolz of Thought. At 14, she began writing her own songs; the same year, a local DJ at Club Fever began inviting her on-stage to sing a song every Friday. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\nFLAC (Lossless)\n\t\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCan't Take Me Home (2000)\n\nM!ssundaztood (Deluxe Edition) (2001)\n\nTry This (2003)\n\nI'm Not Dead (2006)\n\nFunhouse (2008)\n\nGreatest Hits...So Far!!!
