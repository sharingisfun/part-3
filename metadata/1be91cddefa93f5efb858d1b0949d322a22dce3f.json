'CSA' ventures a glimpse at such a world. It simulates the experience of watching the grand history of the Confederate nation as it fights to preserve its antebellum way of life. After triumphing at Gettysburg, the South sends Lincoln packing to Canada and gets cozy in the White House. The long-term result is slavery of all non-Aryans, an all-out conquest and apartheid in Latin America, an alliance with Hitler, a Cold War with Canada, and a slave shopping network.\n\nPlease seed. Don't let this torrent die like the others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1be91cddefa93f5efb858d1b0949d322a22dce3f","amp;dn":"CSA%3A+The+Confederate+States+of+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1be91cddefa93f5efb858d1b0949d322a22dce3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,233,28,221,239,169,63,94,251,133,141,27,9,73,211,34,162,45,206,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
