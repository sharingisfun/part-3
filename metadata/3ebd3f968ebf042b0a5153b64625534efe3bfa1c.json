The music is straightahead West Coast bop.\n\nThe pairing of Stan Getz and Chet Baker in 1958 in Chicago for an LP seemed like such a natural thing - both being golden boys enjoying their heydays with lyrically clean, brilliant solo styles.\n\nThe original LP was of an all-tube session in February of 1958 that was the first time Getz and Baker recorded together. It was before the trumpeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s association with Gerry Mulligan which brought him to the publicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention. \n\nTheir playing on &quot;I'll Remember April&quot; is a study in contrasts: Getz's long lines against Baker's shorter phrases. Baker delivers his best solo here, keeping to a medium tempo, while Getz gives his all on his curiously named adaptation of &quot;Cherokee&quot;, which he cranks up to a furious tempo.\n \nThe proceedings are fueled throughout by a solid Chicago rhythm section.\nStan Getz &amp; Chet Baker\n\n\nStan meets Chet 1958\n\n\nCD / Verve / 1995 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
