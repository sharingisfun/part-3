Each perspective on personality is presented in a pair of chapters, introduced by a prologue that provides an overview of that perspectiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orienting assumptions and core themes. By starting with these orienting assumptions, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be placed right inside the thought processes of the theorists, as you go on to read the chapters themselves. Each chapter concludes with a discussion of current problems within that theoretical viewpoint and the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ analysis about its future prospects. The result is a book that is engaging and enjoyable as well as informative.\n\nLearning Goals\nUpon completing this book, readers should be able to:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Identify the ideas that form each theoretical viewpoint\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Understand the importance of research and why the role of research stresses the fact that personality psychology is a living, dynamic process of ongoing scientific exploration\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ See how each perspective reflects fundamental assumptions about human nature and how behavior problems can arise and be treated from each perspective\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Understand how the different viewpoints relate to each other and the usefulness of blending theoretical viewpoints, treating theories as complementary, rather than competing\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:880c07ae932567f6d898163c040d38f134f0be54","amp;dn":"Perspectives+on+Personality%2C+7E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"880c07ae932567f6d898163c040d38f134f0be54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,12,7,174,147,37,103,246,216,152,22,60,4,13,56,241,52,240,190,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
