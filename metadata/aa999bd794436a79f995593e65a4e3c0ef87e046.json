Rolling Stone voted the single one of the year's best, placing it at #80 on its Top 100 list. Additional singles &quot;Knockin' Doorz Down&quot; and &quot;Pourin' Up&quot; also saw release.\n\nThis CD is the follow-up and the soundtrack for the DVD that took you inside the life of Pimp C, as he gets his life back together after his release from prison on 12/30/05. The Pimpalation DVD showed Pimp C celebrating his release and in the studio working on music with a host of stars including Scarface, Lil' Flip, Young Jeezy, Z-Ro, Webbie, and Bun B. Lil' Flip and Young Jeezy, didn't appear on the album though. Pimp C only has one solo song on the album and the rest are collaborations. Bun B appears on two songs, &quot;Pourin Up&quot; and &quot;Rock 4 Rock&quot;. The two songs could considered new material by UGK. Classic dirty south star Willie D raps in &quot;Rock 4 Rock&quot;, but is not credited. Smoke D appeared in the brutal song &quot;I Don't Fuck Wit U.&quot;\n\nThe album was certified Gold on March 8, 2007. Disc 2 off the album is a chopped and screwed version mixed by Michael 5000 Watts. In 2009, this album was named number 24 on houstonpress.com' list of the 25 best Houston Hip Hop Albums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa999bd794436a79f995593e65a4e3c0ef87e046","amp;dn":"Pimp+C+-+Pimpalation+%282006%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa999bd794436a79f995593e65a4e3c0ef87e046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,153,155,215,148,67,106,121,249,149,89,62,101,164,227,192,239,135,224,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
