The mouth-watering animation, riotous humour, infinitely-variable action and scenery, and intelligent use of every computer reference known, combine to produce a stunning universe where good constantly fights the forces of evil. Dot Matrix and her brother Enzo, plus thousands of friendly binomes, live in Mainframe, which is plagued by viruses Megabyte and sister strain Hexadecimal. Guardian Bob is sent from the Net to protect them, and soon makes it his home. Together, they must prevent Megabyte from taking control of all the systems. As an added complication, games being played by the mystical User invade the system regularly, and must be defeated, or else portions of the city are laid waste... this gives us a chance to see every genre of video-game ever conceived, from the point of view of the characters! When Megabyte finally manages to banish Bob, Enzo takes over as the city&amp;#039;s Guardian, but things will never be quite the same...\nIMDB Link: http://imdb.com/title/tt0108903/\nWIKI Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBoot\nTV.com Link: http://www.tv.com/show/2138/summary.html\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS1E01 - The Tearing\nS1E02 - Racing the Clock\nS1E03 - Quick and the Fed\nS1E04 - Medusa Bug\nS1E05 - In the Belly of the Beast\nS1E06 - The Tiff\nS1E07 - The Crimson Binome\nS1E08 - Enzo the Smart\nS1E09 - Wizards, Warriors and a Word from Our Sponsor\nS1E10 - The Great Brain Robbery\nS1E11 - Talent Night \nS1E12 - Identity Crisis (Part 1)\nS1E13 - Identity Crisis (Part 2)\n\nSeason 2...\n\nS2E01 - Infected\nS2E02 - High Code\nS2E03 - When Games Collide\nS2E04 - Bad Bob\nS2E05 - Painted Windows\nS2E06 - AndrAla\nS2E07 - Nullzilla (Part 1)\nS2E08 - Gigabyte (Part 2)\nS2E09 - Trust No One (Part 3)\nS2E10 - Web World Wars (Part 4)\n\nSeason 3...\n\nS3E01 - To Mend and Defend\nS3E02 - Between a Raccoon and a Hard Place\nS3E03 - Firewall\nS3E04 - Game Over\nS3E05 - Icons\nS3E06 - Where No Sprite Has Gone Before\nS3E07 - Number 7\nS3E08 - The Episode with No Name\nS3E09 - The Return of the Crimson Binome (Part 1)\nS3E10 - The Edge of Beyond (Part 2)\nS3E11 - Web Riders on the Storm (Part 3)\nS3E12 - Mousetrap (Part 4)\nS3E13 - Megaframe (Part 1)\nS3E14 - Showdown (Part 2)\nS3E15 - System Crash (Part 3)\nS3E16 - End Prog (Part 4)\n\nSeason 4...\n\nS4E01 - Daemon Rising (Part 1)\nS4E02 - Cross Nodes (Part 2)\nS4E03 - What&amp;#039;s Love Got To Do With It?
