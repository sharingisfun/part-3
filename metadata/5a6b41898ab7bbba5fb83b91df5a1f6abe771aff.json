Jenkinson, \nJames F. Marchman\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 2003 - Technology &amp; \nEngineering\n371 pages\n\n\n Reviews\nWritten for students of aeronautical engineering and based on a range of detailed aircraft design projects, this wide-ranging book draws together the elements of aircraft design and will support any aircraft design project. Written by experienced U.K. and U.S. based authors this is a unique resource that opens up the initial design process, explores the experience of others on similar projects, and clarifies the processes that are behind the equations and calculations used in aircraft design. Armed with this knowledge, readers will be freer to concentrate on the innovative and analytical aspects of their own project work. Key features include: demonstration of how the basic design process can be successfully applied to a wide range of aircraft; highly illustrated case studies that provide a valuable teaching and learning tool, examining how others have approached particular design challenges; and coverage of commercial, military, and concept aircraft design, plus award winning student projectsthat offer an insight into the conceptual design process from the student perspective","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6b41898ab7bbba5fb83b91df5a1f6abe771aff","amp;dn":"Aircraft+design+projects+for+engineering+students+by+R.+Jenk.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6b41898ab7bbba5fb83b91df5a1f6abe771aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,107,65,137,138,183,187,186,95,184,59,145,223,90,31,106,190,119,26,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
