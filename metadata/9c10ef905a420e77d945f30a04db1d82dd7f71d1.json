The album consists mostly of stark, sparsely arranged ballads concerning issues such as racism, poverty, and social change. The title track is one of Dylan's most famous; many felt that it captured the spirit of social and political upheaval that characterized the 1960s.\n\nSome critics and fans were not quite as taken with the album as a whole, relative to his previous work, for its lack of humor or musical diversity. Still, The Times They Are a-Changin' peaked at #20 on the US chart, eventually going gold, and belatedly reaching #4 in the UK in 1965.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written by Bob Dylan.\n\n    &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n    &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:06\n    &quot;With God on Our Side&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:08\n    &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:41\n    &quot;North Country Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:35\n    &quot;Only a Pawn in Their Game&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n    &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:40\n    &quot;When the Ship Comes In&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18\n    &quot;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:48\n    &quot;Restless Farewell&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c10ef905a420e77d945f30a04db1d82dd7f71d1","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+The+Times+They+Are+a-Changin%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c10ef905a420e77d945f30a04db1d82dd7f71d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,16,239,144,90,66,14,119,217,69,243,10,4,219,29,130,221,127,113,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
