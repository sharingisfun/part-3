What account do I use? If you select Skype Name and use your existing (personal/home) account it will configure the computer to use two identities - Skype for your personal account and Skype for Business for your work account. If you select Microsoft Account, it will create a new Live ID with your work email address - something you probably don't want to do.\r\n\r\n** Office Telemetry (why you might not want to share your data) - What is Telemetry: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/43ebea3e-66d2-4d20-8dd0-2739029a2ebf%28v=office.16%29#appendix\r\n\r\nTelemetry Dashboard displays the file names and titles of documents in each userâ€™s Most Recently Used list, which might reveal personal or confidential information about the user or organization. The names of add-ins and other solutions that are used by Office are also displayed.\r\n\r\nThe telemetry agent collects inventory, usage, and other application data and uploads it to a shared folder, where it is processed by a service known as the telemetry processor and inserted into an SQL database. The Telemetry Dashboard connects to this database so that it can show the usage of Office files, add-ins, and solutions.\r\n\r\nBonus folder\r\n\r\n- KMSpico 10.2.0 + Microsoft Toolkit 2.6 BETA 5 (activators)\r\n- UBitMenu Customizer (adds Office 2003 type toolbars and menus to Office 2016) - free for private use\r\n- Previous versions uninstallers (Office 2016, 2013, 365, 2003, 2007, 2010)\r\n- Disable/Restore 'Sign In' option in Office applications (reg file) - Source\r\n- Disable/Restore Office 2016 Telemetry (reg file) - Source\r\n\r\nSource files\r\n\r\n- x86: SW_DVD5_Office_Professional_Plus_2016_W32_English_MLF_X20-41353.ISO\r\n- x64: SW_DVD5_Office_Professional_Plus_2016_64Bit_English_MLF_X20-42432.ISO\r\n\r\nCompatibility with previous versions\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has removed the ability to run parallel versions of Office with the 2016 release.\r\nPart of the installer will search and remove any previous version and not permit the operation of older components. e.g. an older version of Outlook 2013/2010 with Publisher 2016.\r\n\r\nIn other words, don't mix Office versions.\r\n\r\nYou can use Microsoft FixIt Tools to manually uninstall / remove / delete previous Office versions (included in Bonus folder).\r\nThis should remove all traces of Office from the system.\r\n\r\nUpdating Microsfot Office 2016 Volume Edition\r\n\r\nUnlike the Click2Run editions, the Volume Edition does not offer updating the application through the Account page (File --&gt; Accounts --&gt; Updates).\r\nTo get updates for the Office 2016 VL version, you must enable &quot;Get updates for other products from Microsoft update&quot; in Windows Update.\r\n\r\nSystem requirements\r\n\r\n- 64-bit version runs on 64-bit systems only\r\n- OS: Windows 10/8.1/8/7 SP1 + Windows 10 Server, Server 2012 R2/2012/2008 R2\r\n- .NET version: .NET 3.5 required.
