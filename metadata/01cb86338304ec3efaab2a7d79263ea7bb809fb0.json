Each level is a mission that features a series of objectives that are displayed on the heads up display, which marks the direction and distance towards and from such objectives. Damage to the player is shown by blood shown on the screen. The player's health regenerates as time passes. Tasks vary in their requirements, having the player arrive at a particular checkpoint, eliminate enemies in a specified location, stand their ground to defend an objective, or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation. The player will be accompanied by troops who cannot be issued orders.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-Characters-\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe game will see the return of Task Force 141 Captain John &quot;Soap&quot; MacTavish (voiced by Kevin McKidd), former SAS Captain John Price (voiced by Billy Murray) and Russian informant Nikolai who are on the run after killing the rogue U.S. Army Lieutenant General Shepherd. Russian Ultranationalist Vladimir Makarov (voiced by Roman Varshavsky) will also reprise as the game's primary antagonist. Several new playable characters have been added, including Derek &quot;Frost&quot; Westbrook (voiced by Corey Stoll)and Sandman (voiced by Christopher Meloni), a pair of Delta Force operatives in New York City; Marcus Burns (voiced by Christian Coulson), a Sergeant in the Special Air Service fighting in London; and Yuri, a Russian federal security agent. Wallcroft (voiced by Craig Fairbrass) from Call of Duty 4 will also return in the game.\n\nNew non-playable characters that have been confirmed so far include Truck and Grunt (voiced by Troy Baker), who form part of the Delta Force fire team alongside Frost and Sandman. A Delta Force operative named Grinch was also announced (and will be voiced by Tobey Maguire).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-Plot-\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe game will immediately follow the events of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, where the Russian Federation continues its invasion of the United States of America, and has also expanded its offensive to Europe, including England, France and Germany. Campaign stages are also planned for Somalia, Sierra Leone, Moscow and Dubai. Gameplay videos from E3 2011 in Los Angeles showed Delta Force soldiers helping Navy Seal Teams force a Russian submarine to surface in the East River and boarding it to destroy the other boats in the harbor. Before this, Delta Force soldiers are on a mission to destroy a radar jamming installation on top of the New York Stock Exchange. On Episode 502 of GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley, footage was shown of SAS soldiers fighting terrorists in the streets of London, eventually chasing them through a subway and killing them. They proceed to a subway station and eventually end up on the streets of London once again. Michael Condrey, Co-Founder of Sledgehammer Games, explained that the SAS are tracking a package belonging to ultranationalist Vladimir Makarov and is considered deadly and must be found and captured.\n\nInstall Notes :-\n==================\n\n1.
