Sexercise is the ultimate guide for a hot body and a hot sex life. Intimate photos accompany step-by-step instructions for working out all parts of the body while simultaneously giving yourself and your partner mind-blowing orgasms. He can treat her to Push-up Passion  sexy position that works his biceps, triceps, and shoulders while working her G-spot. Or she can do Glute Awakening  heart-pounding position that has her squatting up and down on his member while simultaneously sculpting her booty and thighs. Aerobics has never been this erotic. Fun icons tell you the difficulty level for him and her, which muscle groups are getting toned, and how long and how frequently you should do the workout for the best body and best sex ever.\t\n\n\n2\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dMkk-a%2BFL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dMkk-a%2BFL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSex Talk: How to Tell Your Lover Exactly What You Want, Exactly When You Want It \n\nPublisher: Sourcebooks Casablanca\nCarole Altman Ph.D\n2004  \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1402203012\nISBN-13: 978-1402203015\nPDF \n240 pages \n1.3 MB\n\nAll the communication tools couples need to take their sex life to a new level.\nThere you are, in the throes of passion, when suddenly, your partner shifts, just a tiny bit. Instead of plateauing, you begin to plummet. Communication is so important, but it's so difficult to tell your lover exactly what you want, exactly when you want it. Maybe you don't want to hurt his feelings, or make him think he isn't a good lover. Maybe you just don't know what words to use. Or maybe you don't even know what you want yourself, or you're embarrassed, or shy, or reluctant to ask.\n\n\n3\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wBF2-8tkL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wBF2-8tkL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFinding and Revealing Your Sexual Self: A Guide to Communicating about Sex\n\nPublisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers \nLibby Bennett , Ginger Holczer \n2010 \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1442200367\nISBN-13: 978-1442200364\n280 Pages \nPDF\n721 KB\n\nFinding and Revealing Your Sexual Self integrates case studies and &quot;Sexercises&quot; designed to enhance the information in each chapter.
