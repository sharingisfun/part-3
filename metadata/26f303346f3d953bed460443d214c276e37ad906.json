Let's Go Crazy\n\nIncubus' &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot; started out as &quot;a contractual obligation,&quot; according to guitarist Michael Einziger and his bandmates &quot;weren't really excited at first&quot; about putting together a best-of collection. But they eventually changed their tune.\n\n&quot;It was almost like we were trying to come up with an excuse to go on tour for the summer,&quot; Einziger explains, &quot;and we started really thinking about the idea of putting out a greatest hits album and having that as the excuse to accompany the tour we were planning. And then as we started planning it, it became really obvious that greatest hits records are really important to the legacy of any band. I was introduced to most of the groups I grew up listening to artists like Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley and the Doors through their greatest hits records.\n\n\n&quot;So we began realizing that it's in fact really an honor to be able to put together a greatest hits package, and it started becoming nostalgic, like watching a home movie. It's really cool to take a step back and look at this collection of music we've spent all these years writing and playing. It's humbling.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26f303346f3d953bed460443d214c276e37ad906","amp;dn":"Incubus+-+Monuments+And+Melodies+%5BCD+Rip%5D+%5BAll+Cov%2B2CD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26f303346f3d953bed460443d214c276e37ad906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,243,3,52,111,61,149,59,237,70,4,67,210,20,194,118,227,122,217,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
