In America, he's only managed two Top 40 hits -- 1983's &quot;Don't Pay the Ferryman&quot; (number 34) and the number three ballad &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; (1986). In Britain, he's had the same number of Top 40 singles -- &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; was a number one hit and &quot;Missing You&quot; peaked at number three -- yet he's had a number of minor hits. Nevertheless, he has gained an astounding popularity in other countries, particularly Norway and Brazil. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Here Is Your Paradise\n02.Forever More\n03.The Lady In Red\n04.Missing You\n05.Much More Than This\n06.Fatal Hesitation\n07.In Love Forever\n08.So Beautiful\n09.Almays On My Mind\n10.Separate Tables\n11.If You Really Love Her, Let Her Go\n12.Suddenly Love\n13.Lonely Sky\n14.The Head And The Heart\n15.A Spaceman Came Travelling\n16.Borderline\n17.There's A New Star Up In Heaven Tonight\n18.The Girl With April In Her Eyes\n19.It's Such A Long Way Home\n20.Five Past Dreams\n21.Footsteps\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Moonlight And Vodka\n02.Sailing Away\n03.Everywhere I Go\n04.Every Step Of The Way\n05.When I Think Of You\n06.Every Drop Of Rain\n07.The Snows Of New York\n08.The Traveller\n09.Don't Pay The Ferryman\n10.Blonde Hair, Blue Jeans\n11.In A Country Churchyard\n12.Patricia The Stripper\n13.Lebanese Night\n14.One World\n15.This Waiting Heart\n16.Up Here In Heaven\n17.Tender Hands\n18.High On Emotion\n19.Say Goodbye To It All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ed609024620cee53241bc276d1fab8ec59f01b2","amp;dn":"Chris+De+Burgh+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282012%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ed609024620cee53241bc276d1fab8ec59f01b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,214,9,2,70,32,206,229,50,65,188,39,109,31,171,142,197,159,1,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
