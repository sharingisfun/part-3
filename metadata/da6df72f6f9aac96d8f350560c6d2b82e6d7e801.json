The other members are Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy Mackay (saxophone and oboe) and Paul Thompson (drums and percussion). Former members include Brian Eno (synthesizer and &quot;treatments&quot;), and Eddie Jobson (synthesizer and violin). Although the band took a break from group activities in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and have toured together intermittently since that time.\n\n.:Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music:.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1975/roxymusic.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1975/roxymusic.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nThe albums\nRoxy Music Studio albums\n1972 Roxy Music @320\n1973 For Your Pleasure @320\n1973 Stranded @320\n1974 Country Life @320\n1975 Siren @320\n1979 Manifesto @320\n1980 Flesh and Blood @320\n1982 Avalon @320\n\nRoxy Music Live albums\n1976 Viva! @320\n1983 The High Road @320\n1990 Heart Still Beating @320\n2002 Live At The Apollo @320\n2003 Live In Concert - The Best Of (2 CD) @320\n\nRoxy Music Compilations\n1986 Street Life - 20 Great Hits @320\n1995 More Than This (The Best Of Bryan Ferry &amp; Roxy Music) @320\n1995 The Thrill Of It All (4 CDs Box Set) @320\n2001 The Best Of Roxy Music @320\n2004 The Platinum Collection (3 CDs Box) @320\n2009 12 Of Their Ever Greatest Hits (Promotional only) @320\n\nRoxy Music Bootlegs\n1979-04-20 Concerto Manifesto (Oakland, 2 CD) @320\n1983-05-26 Out of the Blue - NY (2 CD) @320\n2001-06-11 Glasgow 2001 - Scotland @320\n\nBryan Ferry Studio albums\n1973 These Foolish Things @320\n1974 Another Time, Another Place @320\n1976 Let's Stick Together @320\n1977 In Your Mind @320\n1978 The Bride Stripped Bare @320\n1985 Boys And Girls @320\n1987 Bete Noire @320\n1987 Limbo (CDS) @320\n1993 I Put A Spell On You (Remixes CD-Maxi Single) @320\n1993 Taxi @320\n1994 Mamouna @320\n1999 As Time Goes By @320\n2002 Frantic @320\n2002 It's All Over Now, Baby Blue (CDS) @320\n2007 Dylanesque @320\n\nBryan Ferry Compilations\n2000 I am In The Mood For Love - The Best Of Solo Years @320\n2000 Slave To Love - The Best Of The Ballads @320\n2005 The Collection @320\n2009 The Best Of Bryan Ferry @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6df72f6f9aac96d8f350560c6d2b82e6d7e801","amp;dn":"Bryan+Ferry+and+Roxy+Music+-+Discography+1972-2009+%5BMp3+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6df72f6f9aac96d8f350560c6d2b82e6d7e801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,109,247,47,111,154,172,150,216,243,80,86,12,109,43,130,230,215,232,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
