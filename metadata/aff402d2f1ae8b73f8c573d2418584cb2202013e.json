Saxophonist Dexter Gordon portrays Dale Turner, a fictional\nmusician inspired by a number of famed jazz figures, including Bud\nPowell and Lester Young. Largely forgotten in his home country, Turner\nhas moved to Paris in search of a more appreciative audience. He finds\nit in the form of Francis Borler (Francois Cluzet), a bebop aficionado\nwho befriends the expatriate player. Borler soon becomes familiar with\nTurner's darker side, including his struggles with alcoholism, drug\naddiction, and depression. Fearing for the musician's life, the fan\nbecomes his caretaker, an arrangement that leads to a brief improvement\nin Turner's health and fortunes but places great emotional strain upon\nthem both. Director Bertrand Tavernier pays great attention to the\nvisual and aural details of the jazz world, with outstanding musical\nsupervision provided by Herbie Hancock. 'Round Midnight's greatest\nasset, however, is Gordon's Academy Award-nominated performance,\ninformed by his own life experiences. His naturally fascinating\npresence combines with the film's obvious love of the music and its\nmilieu to provide what many have hailed as one of the more authentic\nand affectionate presentations of the jazz world on the silver screen.\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090557/\nIMDb Rating: 7.3/10 (1,751 votes)\n\nDirected by: Bertrand Tavernier\n\nCast:\nDexter Gordon ....
