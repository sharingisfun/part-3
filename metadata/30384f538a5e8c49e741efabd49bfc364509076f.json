After all, a dedicated fan will have both records, and casual fans will only want the singles on The Raw &amp; the Cooked, thereby eliminating the audience for the collection. Despite these misgivings, Finest does its job well, featuring 12 of their biggest hits and best-known songs plus two unreleased cuts to entice collectors. If you want the highlights, Finest is fine, but most fans will want to stick with the two original albums. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img386.imageshack.us/img386/5484/coverfineyoungcannibals9vn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img386.imageshack.us/img386/5484/coverfineyoungcannibals9vn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackiList :.\n\n1.
