Their early material has been compared by critics to the blues rock of Deep Purple, but they slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible rock style. By the turn of the decade, the band's commercial fortunes changed and they released a string of UK top 10 albums, Ready an' Willing (1980), Come an' Get It (1981), Saints &amp; Sinners (1982) and Slide It In (1984), the last of which was their first to chart in the US and is certified 2x platinum.\n\nThe band's 1987 self-titled album was their most commercially successful worldwide, and contained two major US hits, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot;, reaching number one and two on the Hot 100. In 1988, Whitesnake was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group. Slip of the Tongue (1989), was also a success, reaching the top 10 in the US and UK, and receiving a platinum US certification. The band split up shortly after this release, but had a reunion in 1994, and released a one-off studio album, Restless Heart (1997).\n\nWhitesnake officially reformed in 2002 and have been touring together since, releasing two studio albums, Good to Be Bad (2008) and Forevermore (2011).
