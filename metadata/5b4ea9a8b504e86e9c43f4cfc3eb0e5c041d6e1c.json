Best-selling author Michael ShermerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most accomplished and ambitious book to date demonstrates how the scientific way of thinking has made people, and society as a whole, more moral. Ever since the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment thinkers consciously applied the methods of science to solve social and moral problems. The experimental methods and analytical reasoning of science created the modern world of liberal democracies, civil rights and civil liberties, equal justice under the law, open political and economic borders, free minds and free markets, and prosperity the likes of which no human society in history has ever enjoyed. More people in more places have greater rights, freedoms, liberties, literacy, education, and prosperity - the likes of which no human society in history has ever enjoyed. In this provocative and compelling book - that includes brief histories of freedom rights, womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights, gay rights, and animal rights, along with considerations of the nature of evil and moral regress - Shermer explains how abstract reasoning, rationality, empiricism, skepticism - scientific ways of thinking - have profoundly changed the way we perceive morality and, indeed, move us ever closer to a more just world.\n\n\nAccompanying material can be downloaded here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nullrefer.com/?download.audible.com/product_related_docs/BK_SHER_000011.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nullrefer.com/?download.audible.com/product_related_docs/BK_SHER_000011.pdf&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4ea9a8b504e86e9c43f4cfc3eb0e5c041d6e1c","amp;dn":"The+Moral+Arc+-+Michael+Shermer+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4ea9a8b504e86e9c43f4cfc3eb0e5c041d6e1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,78,169,168,181,4,232,110,156,67,244,207,195,235,14,92,4,29,110,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
