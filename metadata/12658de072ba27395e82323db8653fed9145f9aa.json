TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re very popular in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, especially since their lyrics are pretty funny, as long as you understand German, at least. I tried to download their discography on TPB, but couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find one that was very complete, so I compiled it from elsewhere and bring it to you now.\n\nI have most of their most important stuff here, including some singles, B-sides from EPs and a few random songs. EverythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tagged fairly well, though only the live albums are divided into separate folders (sorry, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my personal preference). FYI, I tried to avoid duplicate songs by only labeling them as being on their original albums:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Debil (1984)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Im Schatten der Ãƒâ€žrzte (1985)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Die Ãƒâ€žrzte (1986)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ab 18 (1987)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ist das alles? (13 HÃƒÂ¶hepunkte mit den Ãƒâ€žrzten) (1987)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Das ist nicht die ganze Wahrheit... (1988)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Live - Nach uns die Sintflut (1988)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Die Ãƒâ€žrzte FrÃƒÂ¼her!/Der Ausverkauf Geht Weiter!
