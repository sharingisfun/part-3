No fictional character will ever equal him.\n\nHere's the description of the film written on the back of the box that the VHS tape came packaged in:\n\nIs financial trading an art, science, profession or out-and-out gamble?  If you're interested in money and you want to know what it's really like on Wall Street, this is the video you, your family, your colleagues and your friends should own.  Filmed before Wall Street's October 1987 crash, TRADER is a riveting one hour documentary of a fascinating man, Paul Tudor Jones II.  It delivers a rarely seen view of futures trading and explains the workings of this frantic, highly charged marketplace.  It gives viewers an inside look at his estate in Virginia, skiing in Gstaad, his New York apartment.  It also examines Jones' prediction that America is nearing the end of a 200-year bull market.  If he's right ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and he almost always is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this country and the world are about to experience economic changes of unprecedented proportions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7d2cdda6ebc8b43944105de659993932d7f6b25","amp;dn":"Trader+-+The+Documentary+%28Paul+Tudor+Jones%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7d2cdda6ebc8b43944105de659993932d7f6b25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,210,205,218,110,188,139,67,148,65,5,222,101,153,147,147,45,127,107,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
