Live at Earls Court 20.10.94, London (1994) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0110758/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0110758/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn 1994, following the release of their album The Division Bell, veteran progressive-psychedelic band Pink Floyd set out on a massive international concert tour. As part of their set, the group began playing their classic 1973 album Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety at certain select shows. Pink Floyd: Pulse is a live video taken from dates on October 20, 1994 at Earls Court, London tour. It not only features the complete live performance of Dark Side of the Moon, but a number of other classic Floyd tunes, including &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond,&quot; &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2,&quot; &quot;Learning to Fly,&quot; and many more.\n\nPulse stands up well on its own merits, extraneous factors aside. Digital remastering of the audio and video makes the 1995 VHS tape version seem like a fuzzy bootleg by comparison. The VHS version was an interesting documentation of a concert. The DVD version is an utterly captivating sensory experience. It?s the closest you can get to being at a Pink Floyd performance without actually being there.\n\nTracks:\nShine On You Crazy Diamond\nLearning To Fly\nHigh Hopes\nTake It Back\nComing Back To Life\nSorrow\nKeep Talking \nAnother Brick In The Wall (Part 2)\nOne of These Days\nSpeak To Me\nBreathe In The Air\nOn The Run\nTime\nThe Great Gig In The Sky\nMoney\nUs And Them\nAny Colour You Like\nBrain Damage\nEclipse\nWish You Were Here\nComfortably Numb\nRun Like Hell\n\nSource.......................: Original DVD5\nDisc 1.......................: 700 MB\nDisc 2.......................: 698 MB\nResolution...................: 640 x 480\nCodec........................: XviD, 2 Pass mode\nBitrate......................: Avg. 950 kBit/s\nFormat.......................: MP3\nSampleRate...................: 48000 Hz\nBitrate......................: 192 kBit/s\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:232750d317b7b0911bbef359ff91167512d6bbaa","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd%3A+Pulse+%282006%29+%5BDVDrip+%28XviD%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"232750d317b7b0911bbef359ff91167512d6bbaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,39,80,211,23,183,176,145,27,190,243,89,255,145,22,117,18,214,187,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
