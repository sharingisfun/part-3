The most technologically advanced nation in the world has a life expectancy lower than that of Chile and Bahrain. And citizens of the wealthiest country on the planet continue to ingest toxic chemicals through their food, their vaccines, and even their water. America, Jim Marrs argues, has been seized by a culture of death. And who promulgates this culture? The globalist masters of the G.O.D. SyndicateÃ¢â‚¬â€Guns, Oil, and Drugs. Pushed to the brink by this lethal triumvirate, Americans increasingly find themselves headed toward an inexorable decline ending in servitude and premature death.\n\nIn Population Control, Marrs takes aim at our deteriorating nation and offers practical steps we can take to save it. As he exposes how daily livingÃ¢â‚¬â€from the food we eat to the water we drink to the drugs we ingestÃ¢â‚¬â€pushes us closer to an early grave, he shows us how a return to true prosperity is possible, and explains what we need to do to fight back and save our lives and our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul.\n\nBook Reviews:\nFrom the Back Cover\nBad Food\nBad Water\nBad Drugs\nBad Air\nWhat if these are all part of a global plot?\n\nFrom the food we eat and the water we drink to the air we breathe, everything these days seems capable of killing us. Recently we have seen an unprecedented number of deaths due to medications for diseases that may not even exist, obscure cancers caused by our modern devices, and brutal police tactics. All a coincidence? Think again. In Population Control, acclaimed journalist Jim Marrs lays out a stunning case for his most audacious conspiracy yet: the scheme concocted by a handful of global elites to reduce the world's population to 500 million by whatever means necessary and make a profit from it.\n\nMarrs, the bestselling author of Rule by Secrecy and The Trillion-Dollar Conspiracy, pulls no punches in exposing this evil and chillingly effective plan. He explains how a small group of tremendously wealthy and powerful people controls virtually every important industryÃ¢â‚¬â€guns, oil, pharmaceuticals, food, and of course the mediaÃ¢â‚¬â€and how it uses this vast network of conglomerates to take actions that lead to the deaths of men and women all over the world.\n\nMarrs answers tough questions the corporate-controlled media wouldn't even dream of asking:\n\nCould the CDC be secretly behind the recent Ebola outbreak that gripped the world?\nWho is responsible for the explosion in prescriptions for potentially deadly medications, and who profits?\nWhy are local American police officers being sent to Israel for training in counterterrorism methods?\nWhy might water be the deadliest weapon of the twenty-first century?\nIn the explosive Population Control, Marrs lays bare the damning truths corporate owners don't want you to discover: how they've spied on private citizens, intentionally spread disease, and destroyed the planet chasing profits, all to improve the lives of a privileged few while eliminating everyone else. Finally, he offers a citizen's blueprint for fighting back.\n\n\nFollow me on https://kat.cr/user/iGetBooks/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48af1c7798dfefc13ab872a99593f183479f6622","amp;dn":"Population+Control+%5BKAT.CR%5D%5BiGB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48af1c7798dfefc13ab872a99593f183479f6622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,175,28,119,152,223,239,193,58,184,114,169,149,147,241,131,71,159,102,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
