J. Jeczalik, along with arranger Anne Dudley, producer Trevor Horn and music journalist Paul Morley. The group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. The band is noted for innovative use of electronics and computers in pop music and particularly for innovative use of sampling.\nThe name of the group alludes to the essay &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; by noted futurist Luigi Russolo. From the earliest releases on ZTT, the band referred to itself as both Art of Noise and The Art of Noise. Official and unofficial releases and press material use both versions.\n\n.: The Art of Noise Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/9727/artofnoise1999.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/9727/artofnoise1999.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n1983 Into Battle With Art Of Noise @320\n1984 Who's Afraid Of (The Art Of Noise) @320\n1986 In Visible Silence @320\n1987 In No Sence - Nonsence! @320\n1989 Below The Waste @320\n2000 The Seduction Of Claude Debussy + Reduction (2CD) @320\n\n.: SINGLES &amp; EP :.\n\n1984 Beat Box (Singles) @320\n1984 Close Up 1(EP) @320\n1984 Close Up 2(EP) @320\n1985 Legs CD1 (EP) @320\n1985 Legs CD2 (EP) @320\n1986 Dragnet (Singles) @320\n1986 Peter Gunn (Single 12'The Twang Mix feat Duane Eddy) @320\n1986 Re-Works (EP) @320\n1987 Moments In Love (EP) @320\n1988 Kiss (Single Art Of Noise Featuring Tom Jones) @320\n1989 Paranoimia (Single UK + Video) @320\n1989 Yebo!
