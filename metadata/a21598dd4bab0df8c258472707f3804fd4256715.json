A Jedi who left Coruscant to defeat Mandalorians and returned a disciple of the dark side, bent on destroying the Republic. The Jedi Council gave Revan his life back, but the price of redemption was high. His memories have been erased. All thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left are nightmares and deep, abiding fear.\n\nWhat exactly happened beyond the Outer Rim? Revan canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite remember, yet canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t entirely forget. Somehow he stumbled across a terrible secret that threatens the very existence of the Republic. With no idea what it is, or how to stop it, Revan may very well fail, for heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never faced a more powerful and diabolic enemy. But only death can stop him from trying. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10687840-revan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10687840-revan&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDeceived\n\nThe second novel set in the Old Republic era and based on the massively multiplayer online game Star WarsÃ‚Â®: The Old RepublicÃ¢â€žÂ¢ ramps up the action and brings readers face-to-face for the first time with a Sith warrior to rival the most sinister of the OrderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dark LordsÃ¢â‚¬â€Darth Malgus, the mysterious, masked Sith of the wildly popular Ã¢â‚¬Å“DeceivedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“HopeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ game trailers.\n\nMalgus brought down the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in a brutal assault that shocked the galaxy. But if war crowned him the darkest of Sith heroes, peace would transform him into something far more heinousÃ¢â‚¬â€something Malgus would never want to be, but cannot stop, any more than he can stop the rogue Jedi fast approaching.\n\nHer name is Aryn LeneerÃ¢â‚¬â€and the lone Knight that Malgus cut down in the fierce battle for the Jedi Temple was her Master. And now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to find out what happened to him, even if it means breaking every rule in the book. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8015504-deceived&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8015504-deceived&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFatal Alliance\n\n\nBioWare and LucasArtsÃ¢â‚¬â€creators of the hugely popular Star Wars:Ã‚Â® Knights of the Old RepublicÃ‚Â® video gameÃ¢â‚¬â€have combined their storytelling talents and cutting-edge technology for an innovative new massively multiplayer online role-playing game that allows players to create their own personal Star Wars adventure 3,500 years before the rise of Darth Vader. Now #1 New York Times bestselling author Sean Williams brings the world of the game to life in his latest novel, Star Wars: The Old Republic: Fatal Alliance.\n\nTassaa Bareesh, a matriarch in the Hutt crime cartel, is holding an auction thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drawing attention from across the galaxy. Representatives of both the Republic and the Sith Empire are present, along with a Jedi Padawan sent to investigate, a disenfranchised trooper drummed out of the RepublicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite Blackstar Squad, and a mysterious Mandalorian with a private agenda. But the RepublicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s envoy is not what he seems, the EmpireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delegate is a ruthless Sith apprentice, the Jedi Padawan is determined to do the right thing and terrified that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, the trooper hopes to redeem her reputation, and the Mandalorian is somehow managing to keep one step ahead of everyone.\n\nNone of these guestsÃ¢â‚¬â€invited or uninvitedÃ¢â‚¬â€have any intention of participating in the auction. Instead they plan to steal the prize, which is locked inside an impregnable vault: two burned chunks of an exploded star cruiser, one of which may hold the key to the wealth of an entire world.\n\nBut the truth about the treasure is dangerous and deadly. And in the end, Sith and Jedi, Republic and Empire, must do something theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never done before, something that all the agents of good and evil could never make them do: join together to stop a powerful threat that could destroy the galaxy. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7493770-fatal-alliance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7493770-fatal-alliance&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnnihilation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21598dd4bab0df8c258472707f3804fd4256715","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+The+Old+Republic+%28Books+1-4%29+Epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21598dd4bab0df8c258472707f3804fd4256715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,21,152,221,75,171,13,248,194,88,71,39,7,243,128,79,212,37,103,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
