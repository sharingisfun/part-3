But lately his attentions have been on his next endorsements, not on his next game. WhatÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹s more, Roy&amp;#039;s temper has run amuck, leading to his being banned from college ball until he can demonstrate compliance--in other words, not explode every time he walks onto the court. Roy waits and waits; for a suitable coaching offer, but he receives only one: the Mount Vernon Junior High School Smelters basketball squad. Roy reluctantly accepts the offer, hoping that a few weeks at the school will prove his good intentions and restore him to his high-living ways as a celebrated college coach. But when old school meets middle school, Coach Roy doesn&amp;#039;t know what hit him. It&amp;#039;s not until Roy decides to teach his young charges some new concepts--like passing, rebounding, dribbling, and scoring--that the Smelters begin to find success and Roy finds something long thought lost: his love of the game.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dda28f5e3b2600bdd10736d2c2dccc385dc04887","amp;dn":"Rebound.2005.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dda28f5e3b2600bdd10736d2c2dccc385dc04887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,162,143,94,59,38,0,189,209,7,54,210,194,220,204,56,93,192,72,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
