Toni! TonÃƒÂ©! is an African American soul and R&amp;B group from Oakland, California, who were popular during the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s. During the band's heyday, it was composed of Dwayne Wiggins on lead vocals and guitar, his brother Raphael Saadiq (born Charles Ray Wiggins) on lead vocals and bass, and their cousin Timothy Christian Riley on drums and keyboards. \n\nOriginally, the band went by &quot;Tony, Toni, Tone&quot; as a joke, until they realized it had a nice ring to it.\n\nAfter making their debut with Who? in 1988, the group released albums to enormous success, particularly The Revival (1990) and Sons of Soul (1993), which gave them their greatest commercial success and was certified double platinum in the United States. Tony! Toni! TonÃƒÂ©! disbanded after the release of their fourth album House of Music (1996), which critics cite as their greatest work.\n\nI absolutely loved this group and still dance to their hits. I never found out why the group suddenly disbanded at the height of such success. Nonetheless their music still lives.\n\nAs always seed as long as possible so that their music continues to live..\n\nAlbum Includes:\n\n1988 - WHO\n1990 - THE REVIVAL\n1993 - SONS OF SOUL\n1996 - HOUSE OF MUSIC\n\nCOMPILATIONS\n\n1991 - Let's Groove With The Tony's\n1997 - Hits\n2001 - 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection\n\nSINGLES\n\n1990 - Feels Good\n1991 - Whatever You Want\n1993 - If I Had No Loot\n1996 - Let's Get Down\n1997 - Thinking Of You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d44d8a744d65b303d86e3aa9df5d8cb9b6dc6ac","amp;dn":"TONI+TONY+TONE+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d44d8a744d65b303d86e3aa9df5d8cb9b6dc6ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,68,216,167,68,214,91,48,61,134,227,170,157,245,216,203,155,109,198,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
