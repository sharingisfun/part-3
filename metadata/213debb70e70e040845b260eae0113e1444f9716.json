The pocket hole jig, usually a stepped drill bit and guide bushing, drills an angled hole though the end of a piece of wood. A pocket screw, similar to a wide pan-head screw, is then driven through the hole into the mating piece of wood making a strong, tight joint. The advantage is that you are driving the screw through the end grain, similar to toe-nailing into the side grain.\n\nThe 8 projects in this book range from a simple picture frame, through a bathroom vanity, to furniture projects such as a bed, end table, and dresser. Furniture maker Mark Edmundson explains the basics of pocket hole joinery, helps you select the right jig for the job, shows how to use pocket screws with dowels and biscuits, and explains why clamping is the most important part of the assembly. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a complete course in pocket hole joinery, with 8 great projects to show for it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213debb70e70e040845b260eae0113e1444f9716","amp;dn":"Pocket+Hole+Joinery+-+Bookshelf%2C+Picture+Frame%2CDresser%2CBathroom+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213debb70e70e040845b260eae0113e1444f9716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,61,235,183,14,112,224,64,132,91,38,14,174,1,19,225,68,79,151,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
