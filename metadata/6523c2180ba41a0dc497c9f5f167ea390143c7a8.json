The last concert came in Nuremberg, Germany on 4 September, at the Monsters of Rock festival.\n\nThese 14 tracks are probably the finest legacy on stage that the final Lizzy line-up (Lynott-Gorham-Sykes-Wharton-Downey) left for us.\nAn excellent live album.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6523c2180ba41a0dc497c9f5f167ea390143c7a8","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy+-+BBC+Radio+1%3A+In+Concert+%2F+Reading+1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6523c2180ba41a0dc497c9f5f167ea390143c7a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,35,194,24,11,164,26,13,196,151,201,245,241,103,234,57,1,67,199,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
