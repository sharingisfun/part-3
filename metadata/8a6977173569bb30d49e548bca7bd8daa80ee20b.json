It will be helpful for students attending High School and also in preparation for Mathematical competitions or Olympiads at a younger age. The assignments can equally be used in the classroom or in extracurricular activities. The fun and games are delightful, original, and solving them is even more enjoyable thanks to the funny illustrations. Most of the math problems do not require any exceptional mathematical proficiency, but above all, they challenge one's creativity and ability to think logically. Only a few solicit the knowledge of algebraic expressions and rules of geometry.
