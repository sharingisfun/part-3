ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the average amount of time that attackers reside within your network until they are detected, gathering classified data and information, waiting to strike at just the right moment. Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) helps you identify breaches and threats using behavioral analysis and provides a clear, actionable report on a simple attack timeline.\n\nTHE THREAT\nToday, the topic of cybersecurity has moved from IT and the datacenter to the highest levels of the boardroom. Attacks and threats have grown substantially more sophisticated in frequency and severity. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at stake? Everything from customer privacy to brand identity, executiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputations and beyond. Without a strong defense system in place, the identities and bank accounts of individuals can be hacked, businesses stand to lose customers, and companies can lose control of trade secrets, intellectual property, their competitive edge, and even their standing in the stock market.\n\nBENEFITS\nDetect threats fast with behavioral analytics\nUsing its proprietary algorithm, Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics works around the clock to help you pinpoint suspicious activities in your systems by profiling and knowing what to look for. ATA also identifies known advanced attacks and security issues\n\nAdapt as fast as your enemies\nATA continuously learns from the behavior of organizational entities (users, devices and resources) and adjusts itself to reflect the changes in your rapidly-evolving enterprise. As attacker tactics get more sophisticated, ATA helps you adapt to the changing nature of cybersecurity attacks with continuously-learning behavioral analytics.\n\nFocus on whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important using the simple attack timeline\nThe constant reporting of traditional security tools and sifting through them to locate the important and relevant alerts can get overwhelming. The attack timeline is a clear, efficient, and convenient feed that surfaces the right things on a timeline, giving you the power of perspective on the who, what, when, and how. ATA also provides recommendations for investigation and remediation for each suspicious activity.\n\nReduce false positive fatigue\nTraditional IT security tools are often not equipped to handle the rising amounts of data, turning up unnecessary red flags and distracting you from the real threats. With ATA, these alerts happen once suspicious activities are contextually aggregated to its own behavior, as well as to the other entities in its interaction path. The detection engine also automatically guides you through the process, asking you simple questions to adjust the detection process according to your input","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4b043da0b913412e55048c608f600864f520af6","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Advanced+Threat+Analytics+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4b043da0b913412e55048c608f600864f520af6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,176,67,218,11,145,52,18,229,80,72,198,8,246,0,134,79,82,10,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
