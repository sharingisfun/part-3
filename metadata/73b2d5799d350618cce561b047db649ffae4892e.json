Several passengers and crew members (whether they survived the incident or not) are picked and actors/actresses play the role of those passengers and crews throughout the flight usually starting from boarding of the flight. The flight routines in the air traffic control, cockpit and cabin are recreated on screen starting from departure up to the moment of the emergency. At the moment of the emergency, external view of the aircraft from different angles are recreated to show the effect and what had happened to the aircraft. The responses and reactions of the passengers, crews and air traffic control leading up to the eventual crash or emergency landing are then recreated. All the scenes in cockpit and air traffic control centers are recreated using the actual script obtained from the cockpit voice recorder of the aircraft and other recordings made at the time.\n\nTechnical Information:\n\nTotal Size: 14 GB\nSize: 1.08 GB each episode\nRuntime: 45 mn each episodes\n\nVideo Codec: H264 MPEG4 AVC\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 25\n\nAudio Codec: AC3\nLanguage: English\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 256 kb/s\n\n..................................................................................\n\nI don't have a seedbox thus i have to prioritize\nmy share using this blocklist:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/wnblocklist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/wnblocklist&lt;/a&gt;\n\n..................................................................................\n\nPLEASE SEED THE TORRENT AFTER DOWNLOADING","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73b2d5799d350618cce561b047db649ffae4892e","amp;dn":"Mayday+Air+Crash+Investigation+Season+12+Complete+HD+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73b2d5799d350618cce561b047db649ffae4892e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,178,213,121,157,53,6,24,204,229,97,176,71,219,100,159,250,228,137,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
