Why is the universe expanding at an ever faster rate? What is the nature of the &quot;dark matter&quot; that makes up almost a quarter of the universe? Why does the universe appear fine-tuned for life? Are there others besides our own?\r\nAnanthaswamy soon finds himself at the ends of the earthâ€”in remote and sometimes dangerous places. Take the Atacama Desert in the Chilean Andes, one of the coldest, driest places on the planet, where not even a blade of grass can survive. Its spectacularly clear skies and dry atmosphere allow astronomers to gather brilliant images of galaxies billions of light-years away. Ananthaswamy takes us inside the European Southern Observatoryâ€™s Very Large Telescope on Mount Paranal, where four massive domes open to the sky each night &quot;like dragons waking up.&quot;\r\nHe also takes us deep inside an abandoned iron mine in Minnesota, where half-mile-thick rock shields physicists as they hunt for elusive dark matter particles. And to the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, where engineers are drilling 1.5 miles into the clearest ice on the planet. Theyâ€™re building the worldâ€™s largest neutrino detector, which could finally help reconcile quantum physics with Einsteinâ€™s theory of general relativity.\r\nThe stories of the people who work at these and other dramatic research sitesâ€”from Lake Baikal in Siberia to the Indian Astronomical Observatory in the Himalayas to the subterranean lair of the Large Hadron Colliderâ€”make for a compelling new portrait of the universe and our quest to understand it. An atmospheric, engaging, and illuminating read, The Edge of Physics depicts science as a human process, bringing cosmology back down to earth in the most vivid terms\r\n\r\nAbout the Author \nhttps://s33.postimg.org/e517ofevj/Anil_Ananthaswamy.jpg\r\nANIL ANANTHASWAMY is former deputy news editor and current consultant for New Scientist.
