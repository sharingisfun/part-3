Yet this story forms only the final chapter of the king's action-packed life. Earlier, Edward had defeated and killed the famous Simon de Montfort in battle; travelled to the Holy Land; conquered Wales, extinguishing forever its native rulers and constructing a magnificent chain of castles. He raised the greatest armies of the Middle Ages and summoned the largest parliaments; notoriously, he expelled all the Jews from his kingdom.The longest-lived of England's medieval kings, he fathered fifteen children with his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, and, after her death, he erected the Eleanor Crossesâ€•the grandest funeral monuments ever fashioned for an English monarch.\r\n\r\nIn this book, Marc Morris examines afresh the forces that drove Edward throughout his relentless career: his character, his Christian faith, and his sense of England's destinyâ€•a sense shaped in particular by the tales of the legendary King Arthur. He also explores the competing reasons that led Edward's opponents (including Robert Bruce) to resist him.\r\n\r\nThe result is a sweeping story, immaculately researched yet compellingly told, and a vivid picture of medieval Britain at the moment when its future was decided. 16 pages of color and B&amp;W photographs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b73afade9f98ac44027a2a3f490609323558237e","amp;dn":"A+Great+and+Terrible+King%3A+Edward+I+and+the+Forging+of+Britain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b73afade9f98ac44027a2a3f490609323558237e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,58,250,222,159,152,172,68,2,122,42,63,73,6,9,50,53,88,35,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
