It builds on the success of previous editions by presenting basic SQL commands in the context of a running case in which a business uses SQL to manage orders, parts, customers, and sales reps. The book covers the fundamentals of SQL programming using straightforward instruction and extensive hands-on exercises. Continuing with its focus on learning the basics regardless of the database environment chosen, this edition features examples from the latest databases: Oracle 11g, Access 2007, and MySQL. The eighth edition expands on the use of running case studies by adding a third running case to the extensive hands-on pedagogy at the end of every chapter.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87cabdd16f64b039e5826c742a4ea626cf22fdd0","amp;dn":"A+Guide+to+SQL%2C+8E+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87cabdd16f64b039e5826c742a4ea626cf22fdd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,202,189,209,111,100,176,57,229,130,108,116,42,78,166,38,207,34,253,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
