This makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go through the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n===============================================================================\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A captivating story that teaches as it delights.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Paulo Coelho, author of The Alchemist\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A fun, fascinating adventure...
