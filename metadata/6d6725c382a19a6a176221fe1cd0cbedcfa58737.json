Fly was, at one time, an associate of the Three 6 Mafia (then known as Lil' Fly), but he stopped collaborating in 1995 due to monetary disputes and philosophical differences after recording one album under the group's guidance. Pursuing a solo career as Playa Fly, he released one independent album before signing a three album contract with Super Sigg Records. Creating many hood hits and the infamous &quot;Nobody Needs Nobody&quot; is considerably Playa Fly's biggest hit. He immediately gained notoriety from the song &quot;Triple Bitch Mafia&quot;, which lashed out against his former group. Unlike most southern rappers, Playa Fly doesn't embrace materialism in his rhymes, usually speaking on a deeper, more political level. Fly is also respected as being the most renowned lyricist to ever come out of Memphis and among the best the to ever emerge from the South.\n\nIbn (at the age of 13) was already known in his neighborhood for being one of the youngest drug dealers on the block, after spending three years selling rocks, he finally gave it up to try his hand in rap. Ibn not only viewed rap as a less hazardous occupation, but as a way of self expression &amp; communicating his thoughts. Under the title Lil' Fly, Ibn began his career at the age of 16, testing the waters with Don?t Never Test His Pimpin as a start. He eventually became affiliated with DJ Paul &amp; Juicy J of Triple 6 Mafia &amp; under the wing of the up &amp; coming producers, &quot;Slangin' Rocks&quot; was produced (part one featured on his underground single, part two featured on DJ Paul's Vol. 16 For Da Summa Of '94). Known for his hook, beat, &amp; Fly's dope game tales (which he wrote while he was still a dope dealer), &quot;Slangin' Rocks&quot; was an instant success. He was featured on Gangsta Blac's underground hit album, Breakin Da Law, &amp; the Three 6 Mafia's first mainstream album, Mystic Stylez. It was even planned for releasing Fly's first album on their label (which was, at that time, Prophet Entertainment) &amp; his first single, &quot;Out Da Darkness Of Da Kut&quot;, was released in 1994. After leaving the group a year later, Fly put out his infamous diss album, Triple Bitch Mafia, then changed his title to Playa Fly &amp; was featured on Tommy Wright III's On The Run before signing with Super Sigg Records. Playa Fly has expanded all over the south by influencing young rap cliques like I.B.N (who uses Fly's real name as their title), based in Decatur, Georgia.\n\nIn 1996, Playa Fly released his first album with Super Sigg, Fly Shit. The album had songs such as &quot;Nappy Hair &amp; Gold Teeth&quot;, &quot;Da Show&quot;, &quot;Crownin' Me&quot;, &quot;Flizy Comin' (Triple Bitch Mafia pt.2)&quot; and &quot;Work To Do&quot;. It included other artists such as Gangsta Blac, Bill Chill, Criminal Manne, Icy K, D-A-V, Tay-Dog and Playa Posse. This album was also where Fly began his association with producer Blackout.\n\nIn 1998, Movin' On was released. Movin On had such tracks as &quot;Situation&quot;, &quot;Start Runnin&quot;, &quot;Nobody&quot;, &quot;Funk-N-Bonk&quot; and &quot;Write Sum Bump&quot;. It also featured Gangsta Blac, Bill Chill, Minnie Mae Mafia, and Cool B. Movin' On is generally considered Fly's greatest album. Unfortunately, Bill Chill, Playa Fly's father died shortly before this album's completion.\n\nJust Gettin' It On, a re-release of his underground solo CD (with a bonus track), was released by Diamond in March of 1999. Da Game Owe Me was released in November of the same year, the last album to be released by Super Sigg Records, as Van Siggers was incarcerated and his three album contract expired. Just Gettin' It On had songs like &quot;Gettin' It On&quot;, &quot;Just Awaken Shaken&quot;, &quot;Triple Bitch Mafia&quot; and &quot;Fuck A Wanna Be&quot;. Just Gettin' It On included the Minnie Mae Mafia, Terror, Lil' Yo, Gangsta Blac and the late Bill Chill. Just Gettin' It On was much darker and more violent that Fly's other albums; he spoke about killing, murder and homicide to the remaining members of Three 6. Also, the bonus track, &quot;Fuck A Wanna Be&quot;, had a video made to it (under the title &quot;Just A Wanna Be&quot;) and is Playa Fly's only music video.\n\nDa Game Owe Me is, along with Movin' On, considered Playa Fly's best album. It had such songs as &quot;Ghetto Eyes&quot;, &quot;Talkin' Cash&quot;, &quot;Damn What Another Say&quot;, &quot;Breakin' Da Law&quot;, &quot;Get'Em&quot;, &quot;Feel Me&quot;, &quot;Send For Me&quot; and &quot;N God We Trust&quot;. Da Game Owe Me featured Gangsta Blac, Thaistik, Blackout and Terror.\n\nAfter leaving Super Sigg, Playa Fly created his own label named after his grandmother, Minnie Mae Muzik. On this label, Fly began production on Fly2K along with the forces of Diamond Records. Midway through the project, Fly was arrested for possession of narcotics and sent to prison to serve a five year sentence. The release date for Fly2K was pushed back from 2000 to 2002. Playa Fly was still present on his album while he was still in prison, as he rapped a capella over the phone (&quot;Flexxin' Skit&quot; and &quot;Sap Sucka&quot;). Fly2K was released in November of 2002, the album included such songs like &quot;Bill Chill Lives&quot; (a tribute to Bill Chill), &quot;Universal Heartthrob&quot;, &quot;Here Fly Come&quot;, &quot;Club Friendly&quot;, &quot;We Ain't Playin Witcha&quot;, &quot;Life Goes On&quot; and &quot;Few &amp; Da Proud&quot;. The album included other artist like Mista Tito, Maimi Miane, D-A-V, Bubba Wiley, Thaistik, DeRico, R-E-G and LaCynthia.\n\nFly was released from prison briefly in 2004 before going back another two years for violation of probation. In addition to several guest appearances for artists like Gangsta Blac, Mac E and Gangsta Boo, Fly recorded a number of tracks for his new album, tentatively titled Mafia All Day.\n\nAs of June 22, 2006, Fly has been released from the custody of Tennessee and is now set to release Mafia All Day during the year of 2007. On July 5, Playa Fly's single of his new album, Horses, was featured on the XXL website. In addition to his release, Fly joined the New Prophet Camp.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6725c382a19a6a176221fe1cd0cbedcfa58737","amp;dn":"playa+fly+..+memphis+rap+1996+-+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6725c382a19a6a176221fe1cd0cbedcfa58737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,103,37,195,130,161,154,106,23,98,33,254,28,208,203,237,207,165,135,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
