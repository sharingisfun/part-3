While a zombie apocalypse doesn't seem to be on the horizon now, you can finally test your zombie survival skills for when that day comes. Pile in a car with 4 other friends and embark on a journey across the US in a beat up station wagon. You'll contract dysentery, run into hordes of brain-hungry zombies, and possibly have to put down your bitten bestie Gary. But that's how all zombie survival stories go, right?\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nOS: Windows XP or later\nProcessor: 1 GHz\nMemory: 512 MB\n\nInstallation\n\nExtract and play\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:319eea34189c04eecd999439f2969ea978911556","amp;dn":"Organ+Trail+-+Director%27s+Cut+v1.6.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"319eea34189c04eecd999439f2969ea978911556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,158,234,52,24,156,4,238,205,153,148,57,242,150,158,169,120,145,21,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
