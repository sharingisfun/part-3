He is from the Gumatj clan of the Yolngu and his mother from the Galpu nation. He was born blind, has never learned Braille and does not have a guide dog or use a white cane. Yunupingu speaks only a few words of English, and is said to be acutely shy.\n\nHe plays drums, keyboards, guitar (a right hand-strung guitar left-handed) and didgeridoo, but it is the clarity of his singing voice that has attracted rave reviews. He sings stories of his land in both languages (GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤lpu, Gumatj or Djambarrpuynu, all YolÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¹u Matha) and English. Formerly with Yothu Yindi, he is now with Saltwater Band.\n\n1.
