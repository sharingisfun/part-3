This course draws a roadmap for getting started with 3D printing (aka additive manufacturing), from choosing a printer to learning about 3D modeling. After surveying a variety of commercial 3D printing technologies (filament-based, laser sintering, and more), author Kacie Hultgren walks you step-by-step through a variety of 3D design tools, including 3D modeling and 3D scanning. You'll also learn how to repair designs so they're ready to print, with netfabb Studio, a 3D printing suite. This is a great course for both 3D printing novices as well as designers with existing modeling skills that want to enter the 3D printing marketplace.\nTopics include:\n\nWhat is 3D printing?\nWhat can you make with a 3D printer?\nUnderstanding the different 3D printing technologies\nDesigning with 3D modeling and scanning\nCreating watertight 3D designs\nRepairing a 3D file\nExporting your file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:817c3686754292c5fee785b0fc1b22b1efc57435","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+up+and+running+3D+Printing+with+Kacie+Hultgren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"817c3686754292c5fee785b0fc1b22b1efc57435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,124,54,134,117,66,146,197,254,231,133,176,252,27,34,177,239,197,116,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
