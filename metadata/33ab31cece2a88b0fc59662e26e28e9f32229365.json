Edited with a Preface and Afterword by Danis Rose and John OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hanlon.\n\n\nISBN: 9780141192291 | 544 pages | EPUB + MOBI\n\n\nFINNEGANS WAKE, published in 1939, is the most bookish of all books.  John Bishop has described it as &quot;the single most intentionally crafted literary artefact that our culture has produced&quot;.  In its original format, however, the book has been beset by numerous imperfections occasioned by the confusion of its seventeen-year composition.  Only today, by restoring to our view the author's intentions in a physical book designed, printed and bound to the highest standards of the printers' art, can the editors reveal in true detail James Joyce's fourth, and last, masterwork.\n\nThis edition is the summation of thirty years' intense engagement by textual scholars Danis Rose and John O'Hanlon verifying, codifying, collating and clarifying the 20,000 pages of notes, drafts, typescripts and proofs comprising James Joyce's &quot;litters from aloft, like a waast wizzard all of whirlwords&quot;. \n\nThe new reading text of FINNEGANS WAKE, typographically re-set for the first time in its publishing history, incorporates some 9000 minor yet crucial corrections and amendments, covering punctuation marks, font choice, spacing, misspellings, misplaced phrases and ruptured syntax.  Although individually minor, these changes are nonetheless crucial in that they facilitate a smooth reading of the book's allusive density and essential fabric.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ab31cece2a88b0fc59662e26e28e9f32229365","amp;dn":"James+Joyce+-+The+Restored+Finnegans+Wake+%28Penguin+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ab31cece2a88b0fc59662e26e28e9f32229365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,171,49,206,206,42,136,176,252,89,102,46,38,226,142,159,50,34,147,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
