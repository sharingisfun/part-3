It's an effect that combines panning, delay and doppler effects to create virtual surround sound with 2 channels. The result is a listening experience that transcends normally recorded stereo. It mimics the natural hearing cues created by our head and ears to create the impression of 3D sound when listening through headphones.\n\nI'm a big surround music fan and made this album so I can listen it in surround through headphones on a portable player. The sources are all surround versions of the tracks ripped from the DVD-A. While a binaural track will never be as good as the original surround mix or recording, I'm quite pleased with the result.\n\nProduct Description:\n\nTipper hails from Wimbeldon, England, where he's become known as one of the world's best nu-breaks artists. He has always taken chill out to new heights, adding depth and intricacy to his score of heady electronics. Emotional warmth fills the ones and zeros, along with his usual sonic extremes, creating an album that is at once moving and honest. Surrounded will change the way you listen to music.\n\nGenre: Electronic\nStyle: Downtempo\nRelease Date: 05/20/2003\nLabel: Myutopia Recordings\nSource: DVD-A 96/24 5.1 MLP\nDD 48/24 5.1 (Track 12 &amp; 13)\nResampler: Adobe Audition 3\nSample rate: 44100 Hz\nBits per sample: 16\nAka: CD quality\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
