But by the time things got rolling, Harris was already gone, replaced by Penny Ford, a former Gap Band background vocalist. Turbo B. himself was gone by 1992, shortly after Snap!'s second Arista LP, The Madman's Return, hit the streets. He was replaced by Nikki Harris, a former Madonna background vocalist. Snap! had a second big hit in 1990 with the number five pop single &quot;Rhythm Is a Dancer.&quot; \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.The Power (7'' Version)\n02.Ooops Up (7'' Edit)\n03.Cult Of Snap!
