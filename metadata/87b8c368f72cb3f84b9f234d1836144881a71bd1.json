Maxwell\n\n\nJohn Maxwell believes that the greatest lessons we learn in life are from our losses. Everyone experiences loss, but not everyone learns from it. In Sometimes You Win--Sometimes You Learn, Dr. Maxwell explores the most common lessons we learn when we experience loss. He then explains how to turn a set-back into a step forward by examining the eleven elements that make up the DNA of Those Who Learn:1. Humility - The Spirit of Learning\n2. Reality - The Foundation of Learning\n3. Responsibility - The First Step of Learning\n4. Improvement - The Focus of Learning\n5. Hope - The Motivation of Learning\n6. Teachability - The Pathway of Learning\n7. Adversity - The Catalyst of Learning\n8. Problems - The Opportunities of Learning9. Bad Experiences - The Perspective for Learning10. Change - The Price of Learning\n11. Maturity - The Value of Learning\n\nLearning is not easy during down times, it takes discipline to do the right thing when everything is wrong. This book provides a roadmap to doing just that. As John Maxwell often points out--experience isn't the best teacher; evaluated experience is.\n\nGenre: Business | Management","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b8c368f72cb3f84b9f234d1836144881a71bd1","amp;dn":"John+C.+Maxwell+-+Sometimes+You+Win+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b8c368f72cb3f84b9f234d1836144881a71bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,184,195,104,247,44,179,248,75,159,35,77,24,54,20,72,129,167,27,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
