It was released on 26 \nJuly 1974 by Virgin Records. Although Rock Bottom is technically Wyatt's second solo LP, he has stated in\n several interviews that he considers its predecessor The End of an Ear as juvenilia and not part of the\n recognised &quot;canon&quot; of Wyatt solo records.The album was produced by Pink Floyd's drummer Nick Mason.\nEnlisting friends and luminaries such as Fred Frith, Ivor Cutler and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason\n (who produced the album), Wyatt recorded most of the album shortly after his release from hospital. In \nJuly 1974, the album was released to great critical acclaim. Cutler's performance (reciting a semi-nonsensical\n narrative halfway through &quot;Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road&quot; and intoning the same poem in a flat\n baritone voice at the end of &quot;Little Red Robin Hood Hit the Road&quot; to close the album) was singled out for \nits brilliance, which resulted in his being offered a three-album deal with Virgin Records.\nThe record's abstract sketches of pain, loss and suffering are shot through with vivid flashes of love and \nrenewal, inspired as it was by his relationship with Alfreda Benge, whom he married on the day of Rock Bottom'\ns release. Benge provided the artwork for all his album covers and considerable lyrical assistance.\n\n============================================\n\nTracklist\n\t\t\n1. \t&quot;Sea Song&quot;   \t6:31\n2. \t&quot;A Last Straw&quot;   \t5:46\n3. \t&quot;Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road&quot;   \t7:40\t\t\n4. \t&quot;Alifib&quot;   \t6:55\n5. \t&quot;Alifie&quot;   \t6:31\n6. \t&quot;Little Red Robin Hood Hit the Road&quot;            6:08\n\n==================================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 808 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Rock Bottom\nTrack name/Position                      : 6\nPerformer                                : Robert Wyatt\nGenre                                    : Psychedelic Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1974\n\n=================================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 936 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:230929b638c8729e492cea48072bcdc6e3e8e4a0","amp;dn":"Robert+Wyatt+-+Rock+Bottom+%281974%29+FLAC+23+Bit+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"230929b638c8729e492cea48072bcdc6e3e8e4a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,9,41,182,56,200,114,158,73,44,234,72,7,43,205,198,227,232,228,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
