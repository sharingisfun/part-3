In this updated edition of the classic work, Mark Pendergrast reviews the dramatic changes in coffee culture over the past decade, from the disastrous Ã¢â‚¬Å“Coffee CrisisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that caused global prices to plummet to the rise of the Fair Trade movement and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“third-waveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of quality-obsessed coffee connoisseurs. As the scope of coffee culture continues to expand, Uncommon Grounds remains more than ever a brilliantly entertaining guide to the currents of one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite beverages.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ed53fcf86823f407ae524a7e38b0f620db47466","amp;dn":"Uncommon+Grounds+-+The+History+of+Coffee+and+How+It+Transformed+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ed53fcf86823f407ae524a7e38b0f620db47466","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,213,63,207,134,130,63,64,122,229,36,167,227,139,15,98,13,180,116,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
