The band's original line-up featured lead singer Perry Farrell, \n\nguitarist Dave Navarro, bassist Eric Avery and Stephen Perkins, a drummer \n\nand percussionist. After breaking up in 1991, Jane's Addiction briefly \n\nreunited in 1997 and again in 2001, both times with Avery declining to \n\nparticipate. In 2008, the band's &quot;classic&quot; line-up, featuring Avery, \n\nreunited and embarked on a world tour. Avery subsequently left the band in \n\nearly 2010 as the group began work on new material.\n\nJane's Addiction was one of the first bands to emerge from the early 1990s \n\nalternative rock movement, and gain both mainstream media attention and \n\ncommercial success in the United States. Their initial farewell tour \n\nlaunched the first Lollapalooza which has since become a perennial \n\nalternative rock festival. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of \n\nwhat Farrell dubbed the &quot;Alternative Nation.&quot;The band was ranked 35th on \n\nVH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; list...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane's_Addiction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane's_Addiction&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4f2643dab7d98b4b7bff888d6e325da8feee16a","amp;dn":"Jane%27s+Addiction+and+Porno+for+Pyros+-+Discography+%281987-2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4f2643dab7d98b4b7bff888d6e325da8feee16a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,242,100,61,171,125,152,180,183,191,248,136,214,227,37,218,143,238,225,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
