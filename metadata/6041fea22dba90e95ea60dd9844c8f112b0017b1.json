Over the course of his career, and in particular during his tenure at Chess Records in the '50s and '60s, he produced most of the best work of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and a host of other greats. He also penned a suitcase full of tunes that defined Chicago blues, easily the most influential strand of the blues in the post-war era.\n\nHere, he tears into nine of them along with his crack band of Chicago All-Stars, including phenomenal blues harmonica player Shaky Jake. The result is as close to a blues master class as you're likely to hear.\n\nTracklist\n1.&quot;Back Door Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:08\n2.&quot;I Can't Quit You, Baby&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:40\n3.&quot;The Seventh Son&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n4.&quot;Spoonful&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n5.&quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n6.&quot;You Shook Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n7.&quot;(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n8.&quot;The Little Red Rooster&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n9.&quot;The Same Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n\n\nPersonnel:\nWillie Dixon (vocals, bass);\nJohnny Shines (guitar); \nWalter &quot;Shakey&quot; Horton (harmonica); \nSunnyland Slim, Lafayette Leake (piano); \nClifton James (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6041fea22dba90e95ea60dd9844c8f112b0017b1","amp;dn":"Willie+Dixon+I+am+the+Blues+%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6041fea22dba90e95ea60dd9844c8f112b0017b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,65,254,162,45,186,144,233,94,166,13,217,132,76,143,17,43,0,23,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
