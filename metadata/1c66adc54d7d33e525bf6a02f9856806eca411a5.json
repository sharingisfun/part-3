This text places great emphasis on developing intuition and physical insight. The numerous examples and problems have been carefully thought out to promote problem solving methodologies of the type engineers apply daily on the job. Each chapter provides a fairly comprehensive coverage of its title subject.\n\nSPICE has been integrated throughout the text both as a pedagogical aid to confer more immediately to a new concept, and as a validation tool for hand calculations. PSPICE is used to bring out nuances that would be too complex for hand calculations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c66adc54d7d33e525bf6a02f9856806eca411a5","amp;dn":"Analog+Circuit+Design%3A+Discrete+%26amp%3B+Integrated+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c66adc54d7d33e525bf6a02f9856806eca411a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,102,173,197,77,125,51,229,37,191,106,2,249,133,104,6,236,164,17,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
