Musicians from other African countries were later included under the name Africando All Stars.\n\nSalsa has been a hugely popular style in Central and West Africa since the 1940s-1950s, and the goal of Africando was to merge salsa rhythms from both sides of the Atlantic, mainly based on the African salsa tradition.\n\nAdditional drums (especially snare and bassdrum) were digitally added by Frenz using Goldwave software, making this album sound funkier.\n\nTrack# / Song name\ttime\t \n01 \tBogne Sirala \t06:32 \t\n02 \tMalawoo \t04:54 \t\n03 \tCoumba PeuL \t04:42 \t\n04 \tKetukuba \t05:33 \t\n05 \tDieguema \t04:13 \t\n06 \tMario \t08:38 \t\n07 \tViens Danser (Sur Le Son Afric \t04:53 \t\n08 \tFataLikoy \t04:40 \t\n09 \tSagoo \t05:11 \t\n10 \tKer \t04:16 \t\n11 \tNina Nina \t04:35","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f515dc65b02775361ee1f198fd6f517d1f81eee","amp;dn":"Africando+-+Ketukuba+featuring+Frenz+on+drums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f515dc65b02775361ee1f198fd6f517d1f81eee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,81,93,198,91,2,119,83,97,238,31,25,143,214,245,23,209,248,30,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
