The #1 best-selling ear training method, as seen in major music magazines for 20 years and verified by research at two leading universities.\n\nAn amazing discovery into your personal musical talent.\n\nIn classical times, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin -- and most all the musical greats -- had Perfect Pitch. From classical to pop to rock to jazz, many current and recent superstars also possess (or did possess) Perfect Pitch: Frank Sinatra, Leonard Bernstein, Barbra Streisand, Julie Andrews, Andre Previn, Stevie Wonder, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Glenn Gould, Yngwie Malmsteen, Eric Johnson, Tommy Mars, Bela Bartok, Jascha Heifetz, Paul Shaffer, Yo-Yo Ma, Yanni -- the list goes on and on.\n\nIn the general population, Perfect Pitch is rare. But the further up the musical ladder you climb, the more commonplace the ability becomes. For example, at the Julliard School of Music you'll find about 10% of the students with Perfect Pitch. A typical symphony orchestra will boast 20-40% of its membership with Perfect Pitch. Surveys indicate that half of today's most popular recording artists have Perfect Pitch, rising to 87% for top concert performers.\n\nProfessionals rate a good sense of pitch as the most valuable element of musicianship -- higher than any other essential, including good rhythm, technical facility, accurate memory, intensity discrimination, and creativity. Even with years of formal training and the finest instrument, one's success and enjoyment always hinges on one's ability to hear.\n\nThe Perfect Pitch Ear Training SuperCourse contains 8 audio CDs (or cassettes) plus easy handbook. You will learn the fascinating secrets behind the legendary ability of Perfect Pitch -- the prized &quot;super ear&quot; of the world's greatest musicians, the master key that enables you to:\n\n+ recognize EXACT tones and chords -- BY EAR! + sing correct tones -- without a starting pitch + play songs by ear after listening to them + compose music in your head + perform with confidence, increase your powers of memory + sight-read and sight-sing with precision + enjoy richer perception, finer music appreciation\n\nThe proof? You will actually hear for yourself -- with YOUR OWN EARS!\n\nIt's a curious experience the first time you can tell that a vocalist hit a high C, or when an ensemble has drifted flat -- just by listening with your own ears. Singers find Perfect Pitch invaluable for sight singing, locating obscure pitches, singing in tune, and producing a correct pitch out of thin air.\n\nGlancing at a page of sheet music, others may see only black dots. But with Perfect Pitch, you can mentally hear how each pitch sounds.\n\nListening to music, you can hear that a piece is in the key of G major, and you can follow the chords by ear:  E minor, A major, D dominant seven, etc. -- a vital tool to zero in on voice lines within layers of melody and harmony.\n\nWhen you know each pitch by ear, musical tones become yours to command. For example, if you want to play by ear, your ear does the work for you -- instead of searching for desired tones by hand.\n\nDo you ever have a new melody or new chord sequence come to your mind, unexpected, in a flash of inspiration? When your ear can identify tones with Perfect Pitch, you can take that music out of your head simply by listening to your &quot;inner radio.&quot;\n\nPerfect Pitch (known in scholarly circles as &quot;absolute pitch&quot;) also adds a higher aesthetic appreciation. Acoustical psychologist A. Bachem found that &quot;particular characteristics of certain keys, e.g., the brilliancy of A major, the softness of D flat major, can only be appreciated fully through absolute pitch.&quot; This richness of sound extends even beyond the musical sphere into day-to-day living. For example, as your ear becomes more alert, you suddenly find that you can easily recognize voices on the phone, or quickly pick up languages and foreign accents.\n\nMusic is a hearing art. When you develop your ear, you touch everything in music. Every possible avenue of skill and talent is ultimately linked to your ear.\n\nImagine the talents your Perfect Pitch can open for YOU -- to advance your playing, your singing, your own creativity and confidence. But then again -- how will you ever know until you experience Perfect Pitch for yourself?\n\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait and wonder. Order your own Perfect Pitch Ear-Training SuperCourse -- a lifetime gift of music to yourself. Do it now -- and hear it with your own ears!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34f3ffce398ec749e7c9176ff5a575f034bbcf97","amp;dn":"David+Lucas+Burge+-+Perfect+Pitch+Ear+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34f3ffce398ec749e7c9176ff5a575f034bbcf97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,243,255,206,57,142,199,73,231,201,23,111,245,165,117,240,52,187,207,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
