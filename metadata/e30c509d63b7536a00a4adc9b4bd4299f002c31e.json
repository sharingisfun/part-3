The band consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004; the album was a commercial success, and was awarded platinum status a little over a year later. The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics. Their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, was released on November 22, 2010.\n\nArt is the Weapon.\nYour Imagination is the Ammunition.\nStay Dirty, and Stay Dangerous.\nCreate and Destroy as you see fit.\nEmbrace your Originality.\nThe Aftermath is Secondary.\nYou can and should do Anything.\n\nContents:\nAcoustic (live)\nAttic Demos (VERY low quality, but still their early work) \nConventional Weapons 1-5 \nDanger Days: The True Lives Of The Fabulous Killjoys (VBR) \nFamous Last Words (Single) (All that's in this is track two, because track one was all ready in TBP and I'm not putting the same thing in a torrent 6 times)\nI Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love (VBR)\nAll I Want For Christmas is You\nLife On The Murder Scene \nLive And Rare \nJack The Ripper (it's in the Thank You For The Venom Folder.
