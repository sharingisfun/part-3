A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect honey and other products of the hive (including beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or &quot;bee yard&quot;.\n\nDepictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago, efforts to domesticate them are shown in Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago. Simple hives and smoke were used and honey was stored in jars, some of which were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. It wasn't until the 18th century that European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the entire colony.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13321dad00f63e864636e18d50cef26109093c19","amp;dn":"Bee+Keeping+Books+and+Guides+-+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13321dad00f63e864636e18d50cef26109093c19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,50,29,173,0,246,62,134,70,54,225,141,80,206,242,97,9,9,60,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
