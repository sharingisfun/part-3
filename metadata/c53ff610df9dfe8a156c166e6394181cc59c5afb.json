Madden offers a brilliant and compelling narrative of the crusades and their contemporary relevance. Placing all of the major crusades within their social, economic, religious, and intellectual environments, Madden explores the uniquely medieval world that led untold thousands to leave their homes, families, and friends to march in ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name to distant lands. From Palestine and Europe's farthest reaches, each crusade is recounted in a clear, concise narrative. The author gives special attention as well to the crusadesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ effects on the Islamic world and the Christian Byzantine East.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c53ff610df9dfe8a156c166e6394181cc59c5afb","amp;dn":"The+Concise+History+of+the+Crusades%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c53ff610df9dfe8a156c166e6394181cc59c5afb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,63,246,16,223,157,254,138,21,108,22,110,99,148,24,28,197,156,90,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
