It combines an intuitive compositing interface with a full-featured editing timeline and a huge library of presets and overlays that will have you creating professional-style CGI effects with a few simple clicks.\n\nIn this course Steve Grisetti shares the three ways HitFilm 3 Pro can be used: as a video editor, as a tool for adding 2D video effects to your movie, and as a compositing tool for creating amazing 3D and planar-tracking effects. Along the way, you'll look at how to draw from the program's exciting library of preset effects (including motion tracking and particle simulation), as well as how to build effects and animations from scratch. You'll use HitFilm to add muzzle blasts, rocket fire, phaser beams, and other explosive action effects to your movies. Steve also shows how to work with 3D models and incorporate them into videosÃ¢â‚¬â€including simulating real-world depth and perspective with the free mocha HitFilm plugin.\n\nTopics include:\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Adding and customizing 3D effects\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Keyframing animated effects\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Adding effects instantly with presets and Quick 3D\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Extruding and animating text\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Chroma keying\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Tracking and stabilizing video\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Animating 3D models\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Creating a space scene with advanced effects\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Planar tracking with mocha HitFilm\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Outputting and sharing your movie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:639a96c5e90edfdaf7aec656fa0a83947f0ece6c","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+HitFilm+3+Pro+Essential+Training+%7C+Exercise+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"639a96c5e90edfdaf7aec656fa0a83947f0ece6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,154,150,197,233,14,223,218,247,174,198,86,250,10,131,148,127,14,206,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
