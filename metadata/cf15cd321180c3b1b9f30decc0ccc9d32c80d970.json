The guest collaborations have always been a trademark of SOULFLY and 'Archangel' is no different! We can't wait to play this live for the worldwide tribe!&quot;\n\nIn regards to the band and the album cover, artist Eliran Kantor states: &quot;I've been a fan of Max's music ever since discovering 'Beneath The Remains' in high school. When my wife and I got married, 'Territory' was even played at the dance party part of our wedding.\n\n&quot;Max asked me to do a traditional piece depicting Archangel Michael Ã¢â‚¬â€ and I tried to go beyond the straight-up neo-classical style as that has been perfected centuries ago, so I mixed in SOULFLY's own visual world: hence the wings and spear being shaped like the SOULFLY tribal icon, the cliff with the ocean view just like on the first record, and the Brazilian flag being the core of it's color scheme.&quot;\n\n\n\n&quot;Archangel&quot; track listing:\n\n01.
