The 8 tabs of the stepsequencer allow you to completely reshape the incoming MIDI notes, even a single note fed into the arp can become a unique and rhythmic riff! Even if you have other arpeggio software plug-ins, Cthulhu's arp is unique and powerful with advanced features such as chord-arpeggio mode, ties, duration / velocity sequencing, intelligent transpose, harmony, and more! Every tab of the sequencer can operate on its own length, allowing for evolving polymetric arpeggios. From simple to complex, from chaotic to creating precise arpeggio you imagine in your head!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a video demonstrating Cthulhu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n   VST or AudioUnit compatible host which supports MIDI output from VST's (e.g. FL, Cubase, Ableton Live)\n   AAX requires ProTools 10.3 or later.\n\nLogic Users: Please note, MIDI in Logic requires use of the IAC Bus, since AudioUnits do not support MIDI from plugins. You will experience minor timing issues and a little bit of additional routing (about 7 mouseclicks) to use Cthulhu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      [Installation]\n\n   \n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢   UnRar.\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢   Install\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
