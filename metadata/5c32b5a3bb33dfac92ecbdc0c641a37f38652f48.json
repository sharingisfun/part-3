We see this in new words such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“blingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“email,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and from the loss of old forms such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“shall.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a human impulse to play with language and to create new words and meaningsÃ¢â‚¬â€but also to worry about the decay of language. Does text messaging signal the end of Ã¢â‚¬Å“pure EnglishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Why do teenagers pepper their sentences with Ã¢â‚¬Å“likeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“you knowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?\nBy studying how and why language changes and the story behind the everyday words in our lexicon, we can learn a lot about ourselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€how our minds work and how our culture has changed over the centuries.\n\nBeyond this, words are enormously powerful. They can clarify or obscure the truth, set a political agenda, and drive commercial enterprises. They have the power to amuse and to hurt. They can connect us to each other or drive us apart. Sometimes words are unsayable, and other times words fail us completely because, for all the vibrancy and breadth of English, we still have major gaps in the lexicon.\n\nIn The Secret Life of Words: English Words and Their Origins, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get a delightful, informative survey of English, from its Germanic origins to the rise of globalization and cyber-communications. Award-winning Professor Anne Curzan of the University of Michigan approaches the subject like an archaeologist, digging below the surface to uncover the story of words, from the humble Ã¢â‚¬Å“sheÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to such SAT words as Ã¢â‚¬Å“conflagrationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“pedimanous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn this course, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll\n\ndiscover the history of the dictionary and how words make it into a reference book like the Oxford English Dictionary (OED);\nsurvey the borrowed words that make up the English lexicon;\nfind out how words are born and how they die;\nexpand your vocabulary by studying Greek and Latin Ã¢â‚¬Å“word websÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; and\nrevel in new terms, such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“musquirt,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“adorkable,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“struggle bus.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nProfessor Curzan celebrates English for all its nuances and curiosities. By stepping back to excavate the language as a linguist, she shows you there is no such thing as a boring word.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c32b5a3bb33dfac92ecbdc0c641a37f38652f48","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+Secret+Life+of+Words+-+English+Words+and+Their+Origins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c32b5a3bb33dfac92ecbdc0c641a37f38652f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,50,181,163,187,51,223,172,146,236,189,192,198,65,163,127,56,101,47,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
