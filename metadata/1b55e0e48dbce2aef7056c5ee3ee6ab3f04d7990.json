Carey would set up a game and situation that the performers would improvise.\n\nCarey declared arbitrary point values after each game, often citing a humorous reason for his decision. The points were purely decorative and served no practical purpose.\n\nCarey would reiterate this at the beginning, and multiple times throughout, each episode by describing Whose Line as \\\\\\&quot;the show where everything\\\\\\'s made up and the points don\\\\\\'t matter.\\\\\\&quot; \n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163507/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163507/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whose_Line_Is_It_Anyway%3F_(U.S._TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whose_Line_Is_It_Anyway%3F_(U.S._TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nCredits go to  www.wtata.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b55e0e48dbce2aef7056c5ee3ee6ab3f04d7990","amp;dn":"Whose+Line+is+it+Anyway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b55e0e48dbce2aef7056c5ee3ee6ab3f04d7990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,85,224,228,141,188,226,174,247,5,108,94,227,238,106,179,240,77,121,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
