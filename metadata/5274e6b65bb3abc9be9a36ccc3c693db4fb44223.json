It eases you into Android by giving you some important background and history on the operating system and by showing you how to take advantage of its unique characteristics. These LiveLessons are designed for both technical managers seeking a high-level understanding of the platform as well as developers getting ready to dive into Android programming. After finishing the course you will have a complete, high-level understanding of the entire operating system.\n\nMarko Gargenta is the founder and chief AndroidÃ¢â€žÂ¢ expert at Marakana, an open source training company based in San Francisco. Marko co-authored Marakana's AndroidÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Bootcamp and AndroidÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Internals courses, and has trained over 1,000 developers on four continents. His clients include Qualcomm, Sony-Ericsson, Motorola, Sharp, Cisco, U.S. Department of Defense, and many more. Marko frequently speaks on AndroidÃ¢â€žÂ¢ at technical conferences and events, and is the co-founder of the San Francisco Android User Group.\n\nLesson 1: History of Android This lesson focuses on how we got here. The goal is to give you an idea of the design philosophy behind Android, and what it may suggest about the future of the platform. At this high level, we explore both technical and business choices that affect the platform. We look at how the Android operating system is put together, from Google to the end user.\n\nWe discuss the vision for Android. Then, we look at the Android Open Source Project, or AOSP. We talk about how manufacturers and carriers modify the operating system, as well as how Google contributes to it with its own proprietary extensions.\n\nLesson 2: Android Stack Understanding how the entire Android operating system is put together is important in order to leverage everything it has to offer. This lesson provides an overview of each layer of the stack and its role. We look at both the business and the technical design choices.\n\nBefore we get started, we need to understand the open source nature of Android and what that really means. This detour into legal aspects of software is going to prove useful down the line when we run into its inherent implications. Once we get that down, we explore the kernel space, and then talk about the native layer, the Dalvik virtual machine, the Framework layer, and finally, what makes up an Android app.\n\nLesson 3: Hello World The goal of this lesson is to have you write a simple Hello World application. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to identify all the key components of an application. You should also be able to verify that your tools are set up properly and that you can run the application on an Android device, either physical or emulated.\n\nWe started with an overview of the developer section of Android.com and explain where and how to get all the tools you will need. Once you set up the tools, we take a tour of what is included in the bundle. Next, we use Eclipse to create a simple Android app. We dissect this application and explore its moving parts. Once we have an understanding of what makes up the composition of an app, we run it, both on an emulator and the real device.\n\nLesson 4: Architecting Android Apps Now that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gone through the process of developing a very simple Hello World app, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take a deeper dive into the main building blocks of an application and their key properties. For each building block, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explore its typical usage, the life-cycle, and gotchas related to their implementation. Most of this lesson focuses on a conceptual understanding at the lines-and-circles level of design.\n\nWe start with an introduction to our sample application, Yamba, followed by an overview of Activities and the Android UI. Next, we talk about Intents, the Action Bar and then dive into various types of Services. After that, we cover Content Providers, Lists, Adapters, and Loaders, as well as Broadcast Receivers. Finally, we touch on App Widgets and various patterns for putting together more complex Android apps.\n\nLesson 5: Debugging and Testing Android Apps This lesson provides an overview of some of the tools available in the Android SDK that can help you with debugging and testing your apps. By the end of this lesson you should have a solid understanding of what tools are available and how to use them.\n\nWe showcase LogCat, the Debugger, Traceview and Monitor apps. You also learn about some of the standard Linux tools and their availability on Android.\n\nLesson 6: Android Security Overview The goal of this lesson is to provide a high level overview of how Android security is architected. By the end of this lesson, you should know how apps are sandboxed and how security is enforced.\n\nThe lesson starts with the basic premises of the Android security model, followed by the sandboxing concept, and the enforcement of permissions. Next, we talk about the social vectors of attack. Finally, we mention some of the &quot;bad&quot; permissions and how to try to avoid them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5274e6b65bb3abc9be9a36ccc3c693db4fb44223","amp;dn":"%5BLivelessons%5D+Getting+Started+with+Android+App+Development+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5274e6b65bb3abc9be9a36ccc3c693db4fb44223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,116,230,182,91,179,171,201,190,154,54,204,195,198,147,219,79,180,66,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
