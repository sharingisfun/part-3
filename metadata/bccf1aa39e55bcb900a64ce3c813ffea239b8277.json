But many are firmly rooted in specific landscapes: the city of Thebes and mountain range Cithaeron dominate the tale of Oedipus; the city of Mycenae broods over the fates of Agamemnon and Electra; while Knossos boasts the scene of Theseusâ€™ slaying of the Minotaur. Drawing on a wide range of classical sources, newly translated by the author, and illustrated with specially commissioned drawings, this book is both a useful read for those visiting the sites and a fascinating imaginative journey for the armchair traveler. The itinerary includes twenty-two locations, from Mount Olympus to Homerâ€™s Hades, recounting the myths and history associated with each site and highlighting features that visitors can still see today.\r\nScholarly text, supported by quotes from primary sources and contemporary research, as well as the enticing stories of gods and goddesses, heroes and villains, enrich the readerâ€™s literal or simply literary experience of these sites, whose significance still resonates today. 69 color illustrations plus one map.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nDavid Stuttard taught at the universities of Edinburgh, St. Andrews and York, and has written numerous books including A History of Ancient Greece in Fifty Lives and, along with Sam Moorhead, The Romans Who Shaped Britain.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nMap\r\nIntroduction: Greek Mythology in Context\r\n1.
