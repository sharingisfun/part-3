As of 2005 it comprises two six-issue limited series, each collected in graphic novel format. There is also a prequel short story, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Allan and the Sundered VeilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, included in the first series, and an extensive appendix detailing the alternate universe the League is set in, called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The New TravellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AlmanacÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, in Volume Two. The story takes place in 1898 in a fictional world where all of the characters and events from literature (and possibly the entirety of fiction) coexist. The world the characters inhabit is one more technologically advanced than our own was in the same era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7d0bdbc8d534eccd1bfcd377539d666f39bc30e","amp;dn":"The+League+of+Extraordinary+Gentlemen+v1+%2B+v2++Alan+Moore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7d0bdbc8d534eccd1bfcd377539d666f39bc30e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,208,189,188,141,83,78,204,209,191,205,55,117,57,214,102,243,155,195,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
