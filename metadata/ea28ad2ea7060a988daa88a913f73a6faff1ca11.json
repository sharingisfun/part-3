So, it&amp;#039;s no surprise that Activision has released a Shrek 2 video game just weeks before the film opens. What is surprising, considering the bottom-of-the-barrel level of quality you usually get from kid-friendly licensed games, is that it&amp;#039;s actually pretty good. Hot off of True Crime: Streets of LA, Shrek 2 seems like an extreme shifting of gears for developer Luxoflux, but to its credit, the game comes together fairly well. However, the older kids who found some chuckles in the adult-aimed nudge-and-winks found in the original Shrek movie probably aren&amp;#039;t going to find anything too compelling here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea28ad2ea7060a988daa88a913f73a6faff1ca11","amp;dn":"Shrek+2%3A+The+Game+NTSC+PS2DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea28ad2ea7060a988daa88a913f73a6faff1ca11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,40,173,46,167,6,10,152,141,170,136,169,19,247,58,111,175,241,202,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
