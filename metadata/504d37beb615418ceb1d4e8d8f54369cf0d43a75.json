The first arc (issues #1-6) were set five years in the past, where the League was first formed by Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash, Green Lantern and Cyborg, when the earth was invaded by Darkseid and his forces from Apokolips. Following the sixth issue, the books jumped into the present, and began to feature a back up starring Billy Batson in his journey to becoming the hero known as Shazam. Considering the title is thought as the lynchpin of the DCU, it often features stories about Pandora, the character who was responsible for the changes to the DCU, and will be instrumental to the upcoming Trinity War. After Forever Evil, which continued from the end of Trinity War, Lex Luthor has joined the League as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:504d37beb615418ceb1d4e8d8f54369cf0d43a75","amp;dn":"Justice+League+%28000+-+035+%2B+Extras%29+%282011+-+Ongoing%29+%28Digital%29+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"504d37beb615418ceb1d4e8d8f54369cf0d43a75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,77,55,190,182,21,65,140,235,29,78,141,143,84,54,156,240,212,58,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
