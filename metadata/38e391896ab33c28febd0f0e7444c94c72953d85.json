She was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature for being a &quot;master of the contemporary short story.&quot;\r\n\r\nMunro's work is noted for its precise imagery and narrative style, which is at once lyrical, compelling, economical, and intense, revealing the depth and complexities in the emotional lives of everyday people.  Her stories are characterized by clarity and psychological realism in an uncomplicated prose style.  \r\n\r\nHer stories are often set in small town environments that capture the social and cultural milieu of her native southwestern Ontario, an uncharted and ambivalent landscape of what affectionately has come to be known as &quot;Munro country.&quot;  She embraces the mystery, intimacy, and tension of the ordinary lives of both men and women, where the struggle for a decent life often results in difficult relationships and moral conflicts.  Cynthia Ozick famously called her &quot;our Chekhov.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe recognition Munro's fiction has earned also includes three Governor-General's awards (1968, 1978, 1986), two Giller Prizes (1998, 2004), and the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement in 2009, as well as the Canada-Australia Literary Prize, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize (Canada and the Caribbean), and the O. Henry Award in the US for continuing achievement in short fiction. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       == Original Short-Story Collections ==\r\n\r\n* Away From Her (Vintage, 2007)\r\n\r\n* The Beggar Maid: Stories of Flo and Rose (Vintage, 1991)\r\n\r\n* Dance of the Happy Shades &amp; Other Stories (Vintage, 1998)\r\n\r\n* Dear Life (Knopf, 2012)\r\n\r\n* Friend of My Youth (Vintage, 1991)\r\n\r\n* Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage (McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2001)\r\n\r\n* Lives of Girls and Women (Penguin, 2009)\r\n\r\n* The Love of a Good Woman (Vintage, 1999)\r\n\r\n* The Moons of Jupiter (Penguin, 2006).
