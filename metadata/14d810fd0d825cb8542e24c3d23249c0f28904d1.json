The incident inflamed popular distrust and hatred against the monarchy. Linked to this historical event the film imagines a group of travellers on the same road, including the American patriot Thomas Paine, the noted seducer Casanova, the French novelist Restif de La Bretonne, and one of the queen&amp;#039;s ladies-in-waiting. They reflect various attitudes toward the momentous changes taking place around them.\n\nAlso Known As: Il Mondo nuovo (Italy), That Night in Varennes (USA).\nRuntime: 120 min\nCountry: France / Italy\nLanguage: French / Italian\nColor: Eastmancolor\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\nSound Mix: Mono\nSubtitles Available: English &amp; Spanish\n\n***********************************FREAKYFLICKS************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
