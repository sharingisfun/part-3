Money) has his own unique style and it's untouchable. The man is one of the most gifted in the R&amp;B scene, plain and simple. It's not only his amazing voice, but it's also his awesome production skills and his ability to mix new-school style with older style of R&amp;B. His verses are fresh and many of the songs have a strong hip hop feel in them. Montell even raps on a few of the songs and he does it well. And don't think that the party anthem &quot;This is How We Do It&quot; is the only song to love on the album. There's a lot of other GREAT songs you'll love to hear again and again. Montell is so talented, whether it's singing or producing the songs. That's something real rare and combined with his charisma it makes MJ untouchable. This is his first album... Check out the rest as well.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMontell Jordan - This Is How We Do It\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Montell Jordan\nAlbum................: This Is How We Do It\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\n\nFLAC\n\nYear.................: 1995 04 04\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 64 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 267kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
