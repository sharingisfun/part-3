Complications arise as Drecker struggles with the eclectic responsibilities of his vocation as a prostitute, while dealing with his undying passions in life; ex-wife Jessica (Anne Heche) , and raising his two teenage children, fraternal twins Damon and Darby (Charlie Saxton and Sianoa Smit-McPhee). \n\nCast &amp; Characters:\n\nThomas Jane as Ray Drecker: Former star athlete turned high school teacher/coach and single dad who becomes a prostitute in order to provide a better life for himself and his children.\n\nJane Adams as Tanya Skagle: A former flame of Ray's who reunites with him later on.
