Born May 15, 1953, in Reading, England, Oldfield began his professional career at the age of 14, forming the Sallyangie folk duo with his sister Sally; a year later, the siblings issued their debut LP, Children of the Sun. By the age of 16, he was playing bass with Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers' group the Whole World alongside experimental classical arranger David Bedford and avant-garde jazz saxophonist Lol Coxhill; within months, Oldfield was tapped to become the band's lead guitarist prior to recording the 1971 LP Shooting at the Moon. \n\n\nGenre................: New Age\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: WEA\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Tubular Bells (Excerpt)\n02.Hergest Ridge (Excerpt)\n03.Ommadawn (Excerpt)\n04.Incantations (Excerpt)\n05.Moonlight Shadow\n06.Portsmouth\n07.Good News (From 'The Killing Fields')\n08.Sentinel (Tubular Bells II) (Remix)\n09.The Bell (Remix)\n10.Let There Be Light\n11.Only Time Will Tell\n12.The Voyager\n13.Women Of Ireland\n14.Tubular Bells III  (Excerpt)\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29914d9d2a34b2ec892c799493ca566eed51ba33","amp;dn":"Mike+Oldfield+-+XXV+The+Essential+%281997%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29914d9d2a34b2ec892c799493ca566eed51ba33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,145,77,157,42,52,178,236,137,44,121,148,147,202,86,110,237,81,186,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
