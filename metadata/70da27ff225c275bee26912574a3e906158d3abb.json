Believers in the Riff. Devout disciples of Rock. They have seen how far off the path purveyors of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNu MetalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and current day ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPunk RockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ have strayed and following in the footsteps of the rock and roll prophets of old, have returned to rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s roots: the blues. But donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be fooled; the blues that Wo Fat is mining from is the dark, trance-inducing, backwoods blues of the north Mississippi hill country. The haunting mysterious blues of Junior Kimbrough, R.L. Burnside and Mississippi Fred Mcdowell. Wo Fat took this tribal hoodoo blues and used it as a foundation for their brand of heavy psychedelic rock. They cranked John Lee HookerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s amp to 11! Despite the heavy infusion of blues, Wo Fat is a rock and roll band, naming Black Sabbath, ZZ Top, Leafhound, Randy Holden and other 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greats as well as more contemporary bands like Sleep as major influences.\n\nWith obliquely political lyrics and a nonstop stream of riffs, Wo Fat takes the listener on a journey through shadowy voodoo-filled swamps to another world where rock and roll is about the music, indivduality, rebellion and fighting the Man rather than about conformity and the corporate bottom line. When listening to this band you just want to scream Fuck Yeah! and hope for more.\n\nCurrent lineup\nKen Strump - Guitar / Vocals\nTim Wilson - Bass\nMichael Walter - Drums\n\nGenre = Psychedelic Stoner Metal\nFormat = mp3\t\nBitrate = vbr\nFile Size = 84.73 MB\n\nTracklist\n1.Bayou Juju \n2.Descent Into The Maelstrom \n3.Common Ground \n4.Phantasmagoria \n5.Noche Del Chupacabra","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70da27ff225c275bee26912574a3e906158d3abb","amp;dn":"Wo+Fat+-+Noche+Del+Chupacabra+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70da27ff225c275bee26912574a3e906158d3abb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,218,39,255,34,92,39,91,238,38,145,37,116,163,233,6,21,141,58,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
