On her perilous (and quite sexy) journey she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Phillip Law), and battles the Black Queen (Anita Pallenberg) and survives various sexual torture devices. Barbarella is full of vintage 60's retro influence. A Spaceship, with wall-to-wall shag carpeting, traveling through a Lava Lamp. And who can forget Jane Fonda's zero gravity striptease.\n\n  Starring: Jane Fonda, John Phillip Law, Anita Pallenberg, Milo O'Shea, Marcel Marceau.\n\n  Directed by: Roger Vadim.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 38min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 304\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa43c75dee28e6045e3daa854f1ce11eccf3b4a8","amp;dn":"Barbarella+%281968%29+%28Jane+Fonda%2C+John+Phillip+Law%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa43c75dee28e6045e3daa854f1ce11eccf3b4a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,67,199,93,238,40,230,4,94,61,170,133,79,28,225,30,204,243,180,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
