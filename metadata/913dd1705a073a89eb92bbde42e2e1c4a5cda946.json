It may seem to cover familiar ground to the outside observer who assumes all solo acoustic Young concerts sound the same, but that, of course, is not the case with an artist as mercurial and willful as Young. Live at Massey Hall is a remarkably rich set of songs, touching on nearly every aspect of Young's personality, whether it's his sweetness, his sensitivity, his loneliness, or even his often-neglected sense of fun. This concert was a legendary bootleg for nearly four decades, and its release is something special: it adds detail, color, and texture to a familiar chapter of his career, rendering it fresh once more.\nAll Music Review by Mark Deming\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] On The Way Home\n[02] Tell Me Why\n[03] Old Man\n[04] Journey Through The Past\n[05] Helpless\n[06] Love In Mind\n[07] A Man Needs A Maid--Heart Of Gold Suite\n[08] Cowgirl In The Sand\n[09] Don't Let It Bring You Down\n[10] There's A World\n[11] Bad Fog Of Loneliness\n[12] Needle &amp; Damage Done\n[13] Ohio\n[14] See The Sky About To Rain\n[15] Down By The River\n[16] Dance Dance Dance\n[17] I Am A Child\n[color=red] Play Time - 01h:07m:31s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 161mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
