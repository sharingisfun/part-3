He paints a vivid picture of his idyllic childhood in colonial Africa, and later at boarding school, where he began his career as a skeptic.\n\nArriving at Oxford in 1959, Dawkins began to study zoology and was introduced to some of the university's legendary mentors as well as its tutorial system. It's to this unique educational system that Dawkins credits his awakening. In 1973, provoked by the dominance of group selection theory and inspired by the work of William Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith, he began to write a book he called, jokingly, &quot;my bestseller.&quot; It was, of course, The Selfish Gene.\n\nThis is an intimate memoir of the childhood and intellectual development of the evolutionary biologist and world-famous atheist and how he came to write what is widely held to be one of the most important books of the twentieth century.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: HarperAudio; Unabridged edition (September 24, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0062283553\nISBN-13: 978-0062283559\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
