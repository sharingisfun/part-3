The Wii and 3DS versions were developed by Firebrand Games, the team behind Undercover and Nitro (both DS versions). It was released in North America on November 15, 2011 and November 18, 2011 in Europe.\nThe game is described as an &quot;illicit, high-stakes race across the country. The only way to get your life back is to be the first from San Francisco to New York. No speed limits. No rules. No allies. All you have are your driving skills and sheer determination&quot;.\nProducers Jason DeLong and Steve Anthony stated during an interview that Black Box aimed to obtain critical acclaim after their last game received universally poor ratings. The Run was in production for three years, though previous Black Box titles had much shorter development periods. The Run was Black Box's last game before its restructuring in 2012.\n\nRipped all other Language except English\nNeed At Least 1 GB Ram to Install\nNeed At Least 25.5 GB Free Space to Install\nIncluded ( DirectX &amp; Visual Basic )\nStart the game from Desktop\n\nInstall Notes :-\n\n1.
