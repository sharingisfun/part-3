The film marshals a range of new print and television advertisements to lay bare a stunning pattern of damaging gender stereotypes -- images and messages that too often reinforce unrealistic, and unhealthy, perceptions of beauty, perfection, and sexuality. By bringing Kilbourne's groundbreaking analysis up to date, Killing Us Softly 4 stands to challenge a new generation of students to take advertising seriously, and to think critically about popular culture and its relationship to sexism, eating disorders, and gender violence.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863522d8274e36c677c5ec83ad9f2c85a3f6215a","amp;dn":"Killing+Us+Softly+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863522d8274e36c677c5ec83ad9f2c85a3f6215a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,53,34,216,39,78,54,198,119,197,236,131,173,159,44,133,163,246,33,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
