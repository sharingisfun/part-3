This book has been thoroughly updated to reflect the major innovations Microsoft has incorporated in Visual C# 2012; all discussions and sample code have been carefully audited against the newest Visual C# language specification.\n\nStudents begin by getting comfortable with the C# Express 2012 IDE and basic Visual C# syntax. Next, they build their skills one step at a time, mastering control structures, classes, objects, methods, variables, arrays, and the core techniques of object-oriented programming. With this strong foundation in place, the Deitels introduce more sophisticated techniques, including searching, sorting, data structures, generics, and collections. Throughout, the authors show students how to make the most of MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Visual Studio tools. \n\nA series of appendices provide essential programming reference material. \n\nUploaded Anomyously.
