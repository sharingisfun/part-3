The 100 Absolutely Unbreakable Laws of Business Success is based on those years of study and provides a wide-ranging view of the things that make some businesses -- and lives -- work, and others fail.\n\nThe author provides a wealth of practical advice distilled into 100 easy-to-follow laws covering the major areas of work and business, such as leadership, money, economics, selling, negotiating, and time management. He includes numerous examples to show how each law functions in the real world and practical guidance on applying it to one's life and work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0d01a6b77a203a6f3e51522f73008ffafdf57a0","amp;dn":"The+100+Absolutely+Unbreakable+Laws+of+Business+Success+-+Brian+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0d01a6b77a203a6f3e51522f73008ffafdf57a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,208,26,107,119,162,3,166,243,229,21,34,247,48,8,255,175,223,87,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
