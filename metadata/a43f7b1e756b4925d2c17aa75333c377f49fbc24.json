There he learns of a great hoard of treasure hidden on the Isle of Monte Cristo and becomes determined not only to escape but to unearth the treasure and use it to plot the destruction of the three men responsible for his incarceration. A huge popular success when it was first serialized in the 1840s, Dumas was inspired by a real-life case of wrongful imprisonment when writing his epic tale of suffering and retribution.\nTranslated and with an introduction and notes by Robin Buss. Includes explanatory footnotes, as well as suggestions for further reading of acclaimed literary criticisms and references.\n\nFrom anreview:\n&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book, and I've read several translations, both abridged and unabridged.\nTRANSLATION\nThe Buss translation is the most modern, and reads most fluidly. A quick example comparing this translation with the one found on Project Gutenberg:\n\nPG - His wife visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride...\n\nBUSS - His wife visited on his behalf; this was accepted in society, where it was attributed to the amount and gravity of the lawyer's business -- when it was, in reality, deliberate arrogance...\n\nBuss's work reads like the book was written in English. The two or so times that the work is nearly untranslatable, Buss makes a footnote about it (eg, an insinuated insult using the formal &quot;vous&quot; instead of the familiar &quot;tu&quot;). Other translations just skip the subtlety. The most common translation out there (uncredited in my version) reads like a swamp. Trust me, get Buss.\n\nABRIDGED V UNABRIDGED\nAbridged versions of this book rarely say &quot;abridged.&quot; You can tell by the size: abridged is 500-700 pages, unabridged is 1200-1400 pages. Go for the unabridged.\n\nThe abridged version is VERY confusing! Pruning 1200 pages down to 600 leaves a lot of plot on the cutting room floor. Suddenly, arriving at dinner are 4 new characters; it's very tiring to try to keep up with the hole-ridden story of the abridged versions. And you know where the holes are? Publishers &quot;clean up&quot; the book by omitting the affairs, illegitimate children, homosexuality, hashish trips, etc.\n\nAs an added bonus in the Penguin Classics edition, there's a wonderful appendix bursting with footnotes to explain all the 19th century references, and a quick guide to the rise and fall of Napoleon (crucial to the politics in the story).\n\nHope this helps. Get the book and start reading!&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43f7b1e756b4925d2c17aa75333c377f49fbc24","amp;dn":"The+Count+of+Monte+Cristo+%28Penguin+Classics%29+-+mobi%3B+kindle+-+Ro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43f7b1e756b4925d2c17aa75333c377f49fbc24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,63,123,30,117,107,73,37,210,193,122,167,83,51,195,119,244,159,188,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
