Musically, the album concentrates on spacious, acoustic-based music rather than Callahan's prior lo-fi experiments. With flourishes of piano, horns, drum machines, and pedal steel, Red Apple Falls appropriates the best of folk, rock, and country, defying easy classification. &quot;Blood Red Bird&quot; and &quot;Red Apples&quot; focus on Callahan's voice and mournful pianos, while epics like &quot;Red Apple Falls&quot; and &quot;Inspirational&quot; use weepy steel guitars for maximum emotional impact. Lyrically, the album's intensity and clarity is equally strong: motifs of apples, horses, and widows thread through the album, evoking rustic, traditional songs as they tell the story of a star-crossed love affair. &quot;Most of my fantasies are to be of use/like a spindle, like a candle&quot;, Callahan sings on &quot;To Be of Use&quot;, blending pain, pleasure, selfishness, and selflessness in a typically Smog manner. But the best songs here combine the album's musical expansiveness and lyrical intensity. On &quot;I Was a Stranger&quot; Callahan sings, &quot;Why do you women in this town let me look at you so bold?/You should have seen what I was in the last town/Or in the last town/I was worse than a stranger/I was well known&quot; backed by more sighing steel guitars. &quot;Ex Con&quot; blends synth washes, horns, and a stiff, mechanical beat in a unique country/new wave hybrid, emphasizing the bleak wit of lyrics like &quot;Out on the streets/I feel like a robot by the river/Looking for a drink.&quot; Another fine addition to Callahan's distinguished, distinctive body of work.  \n\nFÃƒÂ¶r mer lo-fi, besÃƒÂ¶k ÃƒÂ¤ven tvÃƒÂ¥enigheten pÃƒÂ¥ http://www.lofi.se","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb0e4aeec153163b3da92634f8b57f895c17008d","amp;dn":"Smog+-+Red+Apple+Falls+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb0e4aeec153163b3da92634f8b57f895c17008d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,14,74,238,193,83,22,59,61,169,38,52,248,181,127,137,92,23,0,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
