Highly practical articles then focus on the methods used for a range of individual herbicide compounds and classes of herbicide compounds.\r\n\r\nVolume 2 presents some of the key recent advances in analytical technology in this field, before going on to discuss best practices for the generation and analysis of residues in environmental samples. Highly practical articles then focus on the methods used for a range of individual fungicide and pesticide compounds, and classes of fungicide and pesticide compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvides the latest information in one comprehensive source - saving time and money\r\nWritten by leading practioners in key industrial and government laboratories\r\nIncludes key recent advances in analytical technology in this field\r\nProvides full-length articles, compound classes and individual compounds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9dd44d97da7d514b7f90a60053f95cfd12dcbf0","amp;dn":"Handbook+Of+Residue+Analytical+Methods+For+Agrochemicals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9dd44d97da7d514b7f90a60053f95cfd12dcbf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,221,68,217,125,167,213,20,183,249,10,96,5,63,149,207,209,45,203,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
