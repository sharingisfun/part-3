In Transformational Leadership, Professor Roberto defines effective leadership as consisting of three fundamental processes.\n\nEstablishing direction: Great leaders not only cultivate attractive and profitable visions for the future of teams, companies, and organizations, they develop solid strategies for achieving goals and results.\nAligning people: Great leaders have the ability to bring different groups together for a shared purpose by communicating the direction, building a shared sense of understanding, getting people to believe in their vision, and persuading people to enact key strategies.\nMotivating and inspiring others: Great leaders surmount potential roadblocks on the path to change by energizing people and satisfying their core needs, including achievement, belonging, recognition, self-esteem, and a desire for control over their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c4c5157e26af10a2cbded4f8acb7a56083415b","amp;dn":"Transformational+Leadership%3A+How+Leaders+Change+Teams%2C+Companies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c4c5157e26af10a2cbded4f8acb7a56083415b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,196,197,21,126,38,175,16,162,203,222,212,248,172,183,165,96,131,65,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
