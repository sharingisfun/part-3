It is a compilation of his first fifty Number One country music singles, starting with 1981&amp;#039;s &quot;Fool Hearted Memory&quot; and presented in chronological order. A new track, &quot;I Hate Everything&quot;, was also included, and became his fifty-first overall Number One in 2004. The figure of fifty Number Ones relies not just on songs that have reached the top of the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, but also of those which topped the Radio &amp; Records and Gavin Report charts.\n\nAs of December 17, 2007, it has been certified seven times platinum by the RIAA.\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc one\n\n  1. &quot;I Hate Everything&quot; (Gary Harrison, Keith Stegall)\n  2. &quot;Fool Hearted Memory&quot; (Byron Hill, Alan R.
