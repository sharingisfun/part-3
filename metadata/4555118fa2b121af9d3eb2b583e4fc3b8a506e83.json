Few of us tend to feel weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re entirely normal when it comes to sex, and what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re supposed to be feeling rarely matches up with the reality. This book argues that 21st-century sex is ultimately fated to be a balancing act between love and desire, and adventure and commitment. Covering topics that include lust, fetishism, adultery and pornography, Alain de Botton frankly articulates the dilemmas of modern sexuality, offering insights and consolation to help us think more deeply and wisely about the sex we are, or arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, having.\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4555118fa2b121af9d3eb2b583e4fc3b8a506e83","amp;dn":"Making+Sense+of+Sex%2CMaking+Out+in+Tagalog%2CHow+to+Think+More+abou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4555118fa2b121af9d3eb2b583e4fc3b8a506e83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,85,17,143,162,177,33,175,157,62,178,181,131,228,252,59,138,80,110,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
