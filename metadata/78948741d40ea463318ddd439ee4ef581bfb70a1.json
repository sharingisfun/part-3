However, as he watches his memories of her fade away, he realizes that he still loves her, and may be too late to correct his mistake.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/tPbPRNa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/tPbPRNa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/bKoCQfK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/bKoCQfK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/an42HVZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/an42HVZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/3CzJPR3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/3CzJPR3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/vSIcwIN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/vSIcwIN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/oP5pqkS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/oP5pqkS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/6qs7EmZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/6qs7EmZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/b8O5AeF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/b8O5AeF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/gWyBE6E&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/gWyBE6E&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nCast\n\nJim Carrey as Joel Barish\nKate Winslet as Clementine Kruczynski\nKirsten Dunst as Mary Svevo\nMark Ruffalo as Stan Fink\nElijah Wood as Patrick\nTom Wilkinson as Howard Mierzwiak\nJane Adams as Carrie Eakin\nDavid Cross as Rob Eakin\nDeirdre O'Connell as Hollis Mierzwiak\nThomas Jay Ryan as Frank\n\n\n\n\nMEDIA-INFO\n\nBox Office\n\n\nBudget:$20.000.000 (estimated)\nOpening Weekend:$268.118 (Japan) (18 March 2005)\nGross:$1.747.623 (Japan) (8 April 2005)\n\nDid You Know?\n\n\n\nTrivia\nThe idea was brought to Michel Gondry by his friend the artist Pierre Bismuth who suggested, &quot;You get a card in the mail that says: someone you know has just erased you from their memory...&quot;\n\nGoofs\nIn the scene where Mary first comes into Joel's apartment, Patrick and Stan had been drinking beer. At first, just before the door is opened, they are both Rolling Rock (green bottles). After she has entered, Stan's beer turns into a Labatt Blue (brown bottle).\n\nQuotes\n[first lines]\nJoel: [voice over] random thoughts for Valentine's day, 2004. Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies to make people feel like crap.\n\n\nCrazy Credits\nThe text in the opening credits appears quickly and then slowly withers away, like a memory.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind-- --- --Blu-ray.com\n\nVideo Quality\n\nAfter a showing on HD-DVD what seems like ages agoÃ‚â€”April 2007Ã‚â€”followed by a Japanese Blu-ray release that was snapped up by eager importers, Eternal Sunshine finally makes it to Blu-ray in the U.S. with a 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer that's much better than merely acceptable but just shy of great. By and large, this is a satisfying high definition presentation and an immediately appreciable upgrade from the DVD. Clarity is not quite exemplary, but is certainly strong, with ample fine detail visible in the pores and whiskers on Jim Carrey's face, the patterns of cloth, and the textures and lines of in-focus background objects. Color also seems accurate to Gondry and cinematographer Ellen Kuras' intent, vacillating between warm early memories and the cold, ghostly palette of the flight through Joel's mind. (Of course, Clementine's ever-changing hair hues are always ultra-vibrant.) That said, there are a few minor issues that keep Eternal Sunshine from looking its best. Although grain appears entirely natural through much of the film, certain scenes have a slightly filtered, more artificial-looking qualityÃ‚â€”as if smoothed out with some light DNRÃ‚â€”and there are also telltale traces of edge enhancement at times. Black levels also have a tendency to be a bit too dense, occasionally robbing the image of some of its shadow detail. However, none of these quibbles would keep me from picking up this disc. Eternal Sunshine still looks appropriately dreamy.\n\n\n\n*Title.....................: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n*Genre.....................: Drama | Romance | Sci-Fi\n*Encoded/Released By.......: tomcat12\n*Year/Language.............: 2004/English\n*Source....................: BluRay\n*Type/Writing Library......: MPEG-4 AVC/ x264 core 133 r2334 rc=2pass\n*Conteiner.................: mp4\n*File size.................: 3.80 GiB\n*Overall Bit Rate..........: 5 049 Kbps\n*Video Bit Rate............: 4 602 Kbps\n*AUDiO:....................: AAC / 6CH / 448 Kbps\n*Resolution................: 1 920 x 1 038 pixels\n*FPS/AR....................: 23.976 fps/1.85:1\n*Runtime/sample...................: 1h 47mn/01min\n*SUBTiTLES srt:.................: Arabic,Brazilian,Czech,Danish,Dutch,English,Persian.\n*SUBTiTLES srt:.................: Greek,Portuguese,Romanian,Servian,Spanish,Vietnamese.\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n00:00:00.000 : 01.
