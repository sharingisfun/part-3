Eastwood's Dave Garver is a\nself-centered California jazz disc jockey struggling with the idea of\ncommitting to his on-again, off-again girlfriend Tobie (Donna Mills).\nOne night he meets the mini-skirted Evelyn (Jessica Walters) in a bar, and\nhe goes home with her for what he assumes is a one-night stand. Dave\ndiscovers, however, that Evelyn has repeatedly called his show requesting\nthat he play 'Misty' for me, and she is not about to go gently into the\nnight now that she has bedded him. Even though it touches on the early-\n70s flashpoints of sexual liberation, studio execs expressed doubts about\nwhy anyone would want to see a movie featuring Eastwood as a deejay.\nEastwood reportedly answered that he was not sure either, but he thought\nit was a good suspense story, and he offered his services as director for\nfree. Play Misty for Me wound up making five times more than it cost and\nursor to such erotic thrillers as Fatal Attraction (1987) and Basic\nInstinct (1992). Eastwood mentor Don Siegel appears early on as a\nbartender.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Clint Eastwood.\n=&gt;-Jessica Walter.\n=&gt;-Donna Mills.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Clint Eastwood.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Mystery : Drama : Thriller.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1971.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.37 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 917 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 43mn.\n=&gt;-Play Misty for Me..........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/play_misty_for_me/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1800 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 129 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324c74bd311f3879599361bbd647a0194698831c","amp;dn":"Play+Misty+for+Me+-+Clint+Eastwood+Thriller+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324c74bd311f3879599361bbd647a0194698831c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,76,116,189,49,31,56,121,89,147,97,187,214,71,160,25,70,152,131,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
