With its Southern Gothic setting, critics have compared it favorably with novels by American authors William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor.\n\nTHE DEATH OF BUNNY MUNRO (2009), his second novel, deals with a middle aged Lothario whose constant womanising and alcohol abuse comes to a head after the suicide of his wife.  He and his son go on an increasingly out of control road trip around Brighton, over which looms the shadow of a serial killer making his way towards Brighton, as well as Bunny's own mortality.\n\n\nBoth books are in ePUB format.\n\n* AND THE ASS SAW THE ANGEL (Penguin, 1990)\n\n* THE DEATH OF BUNNY MUNRO (Faber &amp; Faber, 2009)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01388ca14a4087a843ad7111473685819014a81a","amp;dn":"Nick+Cave+-+The+Ass+Saw+the+Angel+%2F+Death+of+Bunny+Munro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01388ca14a4087a843ad7111473685819014a81a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,56,140,161,74,64,135,168,67,173,113,17,71,54,133,129,144,20,168,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
