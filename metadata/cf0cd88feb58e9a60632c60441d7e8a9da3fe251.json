And differ he does, with an impassioned, straight-shooting argument not only that lies are \\&quot;the social equivalent of toxic waste,\\&quot; but also that each of us is capable of, and would benefit from, a life led free of the lie. \n\nHarris takes his time defining and stratifying types of lies--from adultery to government cover-ups to the seemingly innocuous little white lie--but insists that at any scale, a lie \\&quot;condenses a lack of trust and trustworthiness into a single act.\\&quot; Worse, the gravest danger is the liar\\'s inability to contain its effects; when we gamble on deception, we can\\'t anticipate how far the lie will spread, and thus we limit the informed decision-making of who knows how many others. \n\nConversely, Harris argues, even if we\\'re motivated only selfishly, lying less frees us to trust others more. And that\\'s the truth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf0cd88feb58e9a60632c60441d7e8a9da3fe251","amp;dn":"Lying%2C+by+Sam+Harris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf0cd88feb58e9a60632c60441d7e8a9da3fe251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,12,216,143,235,88,233,166,6,50,198,4,65,215,232,169,218,63,226,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
