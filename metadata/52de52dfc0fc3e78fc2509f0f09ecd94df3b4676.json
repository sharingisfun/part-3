Do your best to\nbreak all the bricks on the screen without dropping the ball.\nIf you break all the bricks, then you will move on to the \nnext board.  If you are really good, you'll be able to beat\nthe board pack and hopefully have the new high score.\n\nTo play, pick a board pack and click the Play button.  Don't\nforget to grab the power-ups during the game... they will \nmake the game a lot more fun.  Blue power-ups are usually good,\nred power-ups are usually bad, and gray power-ups can be\neither good or bad based on your situation.\n\n\nRequirements:\n\nWindows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/Working On Vista,Windows 7 Both 32/64 Bit\nDirectX 3 or greater  \n(DirectX 9 with latest video card drivers recommended)\nCPU 300Mhz minimum (500Mhz recommended)\n64 megs of memory \nvideo card that supports:\n800x600 resolution and 16bit color depth\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52de52dfc0fc3e78fc2509f0f09ecd94df3b4676","amp;dn":"Super+DX-Ball+Deluxe+%2B+Bonus+%28Full-Game%29++%28Requested%29++%7Bblaze69%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52de52dfc0fc3e78fc2509f0f09ecd94df3b4676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,222,82,223,192,252,62,120,252,37,9,240,240,158,205,148,223,59,70,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
