This new edition has been expanded to cover recent developments such as the use of glass as a structural material. It also now examines the contribution that material selection makes to sustainable construction practice, considering the availability of raw materials, production, recycling and reuse, which all contribute to the life cycle assessment of structures. As well as being brought up-to-date with current usage and performance standards, each section now also contains an extra chapter on recycling.\n\nCovers the following materials:\n\n    metals\n    concrete\n    ceramics (including bricks and masonry)\n    polymers\n    fibre composites\n    bituminous materials\n    timber\n    glass.\n\nThis new edition maintains our familiar and accessible format, starting with fundamental principles and continuing with a section on each of the major groups of materials. It gives you a clear and comprehensive perspective on the whole range of materials used in modern construction. A must have for Civil and Structural engineering students, and for students of architecture, surveying or construction on courses which require an understanding of materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f1958069f43e40a3f705cb698d9db8984cfe03e","amp;dn":"Construction+Materials%3A+Their+Nature+and+Behaviour%2C3rd+Ed.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f1958069f43e40a3f705cb698d9db8984cfe03e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,25,88,6,159,67,228,10,63,112,92,182,152,217,219,137,132,207,224,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
