This documentary is similar, only it's the real deal... There are no celebrities here and there's no messing around. You're invited to watch three generations of men (the youngest of which is a young boy called Natan) fishing freely off the coast of Mexico. For just over an hour you can forget about Facebook or Twitter, and observe what comes through as a beautiful, surprisingly bare way of life that is intrinsically connected to the wildlife and nature. Before Natan splits to Rome indefinitely with his Italian mother, his Mexican father and grandpa give the child a taste of what it's like to be a fisherman. Director Pedro GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez-Rubio does a great job at capturing on film the family's situation and a sense of the kind of memories that Natan is to carry with him across to Europe.\n\n==============================================\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name:                                      Alamar (Pedro GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez-Rubio_2009).avi                     \nFile Size (in bytes):                           734,081,024                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:13:30                \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.818                     \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1098                 \nFrames Per Second:                              23.976          \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                        MPEG-4                   \nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                          B-VOP              \nQPel (&quot;QPel&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                          \nGMC (&quot;GMC&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                             \nNVOP (&quot;NVOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                            N-VOP              \nH264 (&quot;H264&quot; or &quot;&quot;):\t                                            \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.203&quot;                     \n                                                                                \nMPEG-2 (&quot;MPEG-2&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                           \nInterlaced (&quot;I/L&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                      \nProgressive (&quot;Prog&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                                   \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            224                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            CBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2\n\n==============================================\n\nOther related torrents here: http://thepiratebay.se/user/rpessoa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8267451df1e51bcb63193dd6b74cf9a141d909","amp;dn":"Alamar+%28Pedro+Gonzalez+Rubio%2C+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8267451df1e51bcb63193dd6b74cf9a141d909","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,130,103,69,29,241,229,27,203,99,25,61,214,183,76,249,161,65,217,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
