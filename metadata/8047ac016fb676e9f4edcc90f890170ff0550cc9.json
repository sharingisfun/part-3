Please forgive , then, for living out their own kind of American reverie on their latest studio album, Life in the Dark. On this new collection of plainspoken yet poetic folk songs, the New York-based group comes across as a ragtag bunch of storytellers fresh from NYCâ€™s subway platforms (which happens to be where they got their start over a decade ago). \r\nThe more obvious reference points range from Bob Dylan to earlier folk singers like Woody Guthrie, and one thingâ€™s for sure: These guys have steeped themselves in Americana and created some real red, white, and blue tea. \r\nThat said, theyâ€™re looking at the tea from a bit of a cockeyed perspective, with tracks like â€œPlunderâ€ and album opener â€œAerosol Ballâ€ in particular scrutinizing the status quo. Songwriter and guitarist Ian Felice confirms as much. â€œThis is an album about living in Dreamsville, USA, playing music with your friends and just letting it come into being like a radio transmitting messages,â€ he says. â€œSimply put, itâ€™s about people playing music together in a room (at the same time) and trying to achieve a noisy precision of speech; looking at the world through the wrong end of a telescope and continuing our exploration into the perpetual apocalypse of daily life.â€ \r\n\r\nThat last turn of phrase comes into even clearer focus in the full-length video bassist Josh Rawson created for the album. With different bunches of found footage spliced together for each track, Rawson describes the video as â€œan orgy of home movies, volcanoes, cartoons, daytime westerns, wartime reels, and educational films that fall and bend and spill all â€™round you.â€ We donâ€™t make a rule out of participating in orgies, but this one sounds kind of fun. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Aerosol Ball.flac \r\n02 - Jack at the Asylum.flac \r\n03 - Life in the Dark.flac \r\n04 - Triumph '73.flac \r\n05 - Plunder.flac \r\n06 - Sally!.flac \r\n07 - Diamond Bell.flac \r\n08 - Dancing On the Wing.flac \r\n09 - Sell the House.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: Indie-Folk \r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report: \r\nSource                           : CD \r\nFormat                           : FLAC \r\nFormat/Info                      : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM \r\nBit rate mode                    : Variable \r\nBit rate                         : ~743-1000 Kbps \r\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels \r\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz \r\nBit depth                        : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8047ac016fb676e9f4edcc90f890170ff0550cc9","amp;dn":"%282016%29+The+Felice+Brothers+-+Life+in+the+Dark+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8047ac016fb676e9f4edcc90f890170ff0550cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,71,172,1,111,182,118,233,244,237,204,144,248,144,23,15,240,85,12,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
