The Praxis\n\nAll will must bend to the perfect truth of The Praxis\n\nFor millennia, the Shaa have subjugated the universe, forcing the myriad sentient races to bow to their joyless tyranny. But the Shaa will soon be no more. The dread empire is in its rapidly fading twilight, and with its impending fall comes the promise of a new galactic order . . . and bloody chaos.\n\nA young Terran naval officer marked by his lowly birth, Lt. Gareth Martinez is the first to recognize the insidious plot of the Naxid -- the powerful, warlike insectoid society that was enslaved before all others -- to replace the mastersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ despotic rule with their own. Barely escaping a swarming surprise attack, Martinez and Caroline Sula, a pilot whose beautiful face conceals a deadly secret, are now the last hope for freedom for every being who ever languished in Shaa chains -- as the interstellar battle begins against a merciless foe whose only perfect truth is annihilation.\n\n---\n\n2. The Sundering\n\nThe Dread Empire of the Shaa is no more, following the death of the last oppressor. But freedom remains elusive for the myriad sentient races enslaved for ten centuries, as an even greater terror arises. The NaxidsÃ¢â‚¬â€a powerful insectoid species themselves subjugated until the recent Shaa demiseÃ¢â‚¬â€plan to fill the vacuum with their own bloody domination, and have already won a shattering victory with superior force and unimaginable cruelty. But two heroes survived the carnage at Magaria: Lord Gareth Martinez and the fiery, mysterious gun pilot Lady Caroline Sula, whose courageous exploits are becoming legend in the new history of galactic civil war. Yet their cunning, skill, and bravery may be no match for the overwhelming enemy descending upon the loyalist stronghold of Zanshaa, as the horrific battle looms that will determine the structure of the universeÃ¢â‚¬â€and who shall live to inhabit itÃ¢â‚¬â€for millennia to come.\n\n===\n\nRead by David Drummond\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c92b67caaf014055298c80f7eaf808c56d73442","amp;dn":"Walter+Jon+Williams+-+Dread+Empire%26rsquo%3Bs+Fall+%5B1-2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c92b67caaf014055298c80f7eaf808c56d73442","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,146,182,124,170,240,20,5,82,152,200,15,126,175,128,140,86,215,52,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
