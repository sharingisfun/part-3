As the reporters investigate further, the viewers see a display of a fascinating man's rise to fame, and how he eventually fell off the &quot;top of the world.&quot;\n\nDirector: Orson Welles\nWriters: Herman J.

The high.definition.x264.standards.revision.3.1.addendum.1 elaborated and provided a formula explaining how max reference frames are to be calculated following h264 specs. While rules work well for standard WS releaeses (&quot;--ref 5 or higher is required unless the vertical resolution is greater than 864, then 4 must be used to respect L4.1&quot;), it is not accurate for full screen 1080p (1:~1.33).\nBlu-Rays in general follow h264 L4.1 and 4 reference frames, but they are all in 1:1.78 frame as they are meant for WS HD TVs (meaning FS movies have large black areas on the sides). For rips however all those black parts are cropped out.\nFor this specific movie the vertical res is 1080 (1488*1080=1.378), however the horizontal resolution plays a big part unlike in widescreen movies. \nThe formula the rules were simplified from is:\nref = 12288 * 1024 / (vertical resolution * horizontal resolution * 1.5)\nthis gives a ref5 for 1488*1080 and silimiar resolutions: &quot;12582912 / 2410560 = 5.21&quot;\nUsing the --level 4.1 switch basically automates the ref frames setting according to h264 requirements.
