Price plays the vengeful Louis Mazzini, an aristocrat manque ruthlessly determined to get his own back on the d'Ascoyne family who drove his mother to an early grave, and deprived her and him of their rightful station in life. Starting out as a humble clerk in the d'Ascoyne family business, Louis resolves to kill each of the family members who stand between him and his unlikely accession to the dukedom of Chalfont.\n\nIn a remarkable portmanteau of performances, ranging from comic caricatures to rounded, touching characters, Guinness relishes his chance to show off, playing all eight doomed d'Ascoynes. The story is told in flashback as Louis, on the eve of his execution for a murder that was, ironically, a suicide, reads through his own memoirs. The film is beautifully designed and shot, the script witty, sexy and supremely cynical\n\nA very strong candidate for the best of the films made by Ealing Studios, Kind Hearts and Coronets is one of the all-time classics of British comedy, a superlative blend of social satire and black comedy with an irresistible appeal. Hardly anything evokes the dignified yet slightly musty aura of the English stately home and the iniquities of the British class system more forcefully than this deliciously subversive film.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.25gb\nDuration.... 01:46:10\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width.... 720\nFrame Height.... 544\nData Rate.... 1581kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 101kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de51d032f851d808d409cc1601653288eda31a9b","amp;dn":"Kind+Hearts+and+Coronets+1949+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de51d032f851d808d409cc1601653288eda31a9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,81,208,50,248,81,216,8,212,9,204,22,1,101,50,136,237,163,26,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
