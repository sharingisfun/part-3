Initially released in the United States on 16 May 1970, by Decca and MCA and the United Kingdom on 23 May 1970, by Track and Polydor, the album has been reissued on several occasions and in several different formats. As of 2005, the album is ranked number 170 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe album has been cited as the best live rock recording of all time by The Telegraph, The Independent, The New York Times, the BBC, and Rolling Stone. It is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and in Q magazine's list of Loudest Albums of All Time. A Rolling Stone readers' poll in 2012 ranked it the best live album of all time. \n\nIn October 2010, Universal Music announced the impending release of a 40th Anniversary edition of the album which would not only contain the full Leeds show from 14 February 1970 but also the band's complete performance from Hull which was recorded the following evening as well as a heavyweight vinyl reproduction of the original six-track album, memorabilia and a replica 7 Inch Single of 'Summertime Blues/ Heaven &amp; Hell'.[14] This performance had previously been unavailable because of a problem with the recording of John Entwistle's bass guitar on the first six songs. To fix this problem his performance at the Leeds show was overdubbed over these tracks of the Hull performance using digital technology.\n\n2010 40th Anniversary Edition (complete &quot;Leeds&quot; &amp; &quot;Hull&quot; performances)\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1 - Live At Leeds \t\n \t\n01. \t&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;   \t5:12\n02. \t&quot;I Can't Explain&quot;   \t2:38\n03. \t&quot;Fortune Teller&quot;   \t3:13\n04. \t&quot;Tattoo&quot;   \t3:00\n05. \t&quot;Young Man Blues&quot;   \t5:56\n06. \t&quot;Substitute&quot;   \t3:05\n07. \t&quot;Happy Jack&quot;   \t2:13\n08. \t&quot;I'm a Boy&quot;   \t2:45\n09. \t&quot;A Quick One, While He's Away&quot;   \t13:44\n10. \t&quot;Summertime Blues&quot;   \t3:35\n11. \t&quot;Shakin' All Over&quot;   \t4:35\n12. \t&quot;My Generation&quot;   \t15:26\n13. \t&quot;Magic Bus&quot;   \t8:21\n\nDisc 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live At Leeds: 'Tommy' \t\n \t\n01. \t&quot;Overture&quot;   \t6:49\n02. \t&quot;It's a Boy&quot;   \t0:35\n03. \t&quot;1921&quot;   \t2:26\n04. \t&quot;Amazing Journey&quot;   \t3:18\n05. \t&quot;Sparks&quot;   \t4:22\n06. \t&quot;Eyesight to the Blind a.k.a. &quot;Born Blind&quot;&quot;   \t1:58\n07. \t&quot;Christmas&quot;   \t3:18\n08. \t&quot;The Acid Queen&quot;   \t3:32\n09. \t&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;   \t2:52\n10. \t&quot;Do You Think It's Alright?&quot;   \t0:22\n11. \t&quot;Fiddle About&quot;   \t1:13\n12. \t&quot;Tommy, Can You Hear Me?&quot;   \t0:55\n13. \t&quot;There's a Doctor&quot;   \t0:23\n14. \t&quot;Go to the Mirror!&quot;   \t3:24\n15. \t&quot;Smash The Mirror&quot;   \t1:19\n16. \t&quot;Miracle Cure&quot;   \t0:13\n17. \t&quot;Sally Simpson&quot;   \t4:01\n18. \t&quot;I'm Free&quot;   \t2:39\n19. \t&quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp&quot;   \t1:00\n20. \t&quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot;   \t8:48\n\nDisc 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live At Hull \t\n \t\n01. \t&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;   \t4:04\n02. \t&quot;I Can't Explain&quot;   \t2:51\n03. \t&quot;Fortune Teller&quot;   \t2:35\n04. \t&quot;Tattoo&quot;   \t3:02\n05. \t&quot;Young Man Blues&quot;   \t5:41\n06. \t&quot;Substitute&quot;   \t2:07\n07. \t&quot;Happy Jack&quot;   \t2:12\n08. \t&quot;I'm a Boy&quot;   \t2:48\n09. \t&quot;A Quick One, While He's Away&quot;   \t9:51\n10. \t&quot;Summertime Blues&quot;   \t3:43\n11. \t&quot;Shakin' All Over&quot;   \t5:09\n12. \t&quot;My Generation&quot;   \t15:58\n\nDisc 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live At Hull: 'Tommy' \t\n\t\n01. \t&quot;Overture&quot;   \t5:30\n02. \t&quot;It's a Boy&quot;   \t0:43\n03. \t&quot;1921&quot;   \t2:28\n04. \t&quot;Amazing Journey&quot;   \t3:18\n05. \t&quot;Sparks&quot;   \t4:14\n06. \t&quot;Eyesight to the Blind a.k.a. &quot;Born Blind&quot;&quot;   \t1:56\n07. \t&quot;Christmas&quot;   \t3:18\n08. \t&quot;The Acid Queen&quot;   \t3:33\n09. \t&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;   \t2:47\n10. \t&quot;Do You Think It's Alright?&quot;   \t0:23\n11. \t&quot;Fiddle About&quot;   \t1:14\n12. \t&quot;Tommy, Can You Hear Me?&quot;   \t0:57\n13. \t&quot;There's a Doctor&quot;   \t0:22\n14. \t&quot;Go to the Mirror!&quot;   \t3:32\n15. \t&quot;Smash The Mirror&quot;   \t1:22\n16. \t&quot;Miracle Cure&quot;   \t0:13\n17. \t&quot;Sally Simpson&quot;   \t4:08\n18. \t&quot;I'm Free&quot;   \t2:24\n19. \t&quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp&quot;   \t1:00\n20. \t&quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot;   \t8:19\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Roger Daltrey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, harmonica, tambourine\n    Pete Townshend Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals\n    John Entwistle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, vocals\n    Keith Moon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums1\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d7a8fe580e8633be83fc152173ce19db3a32397","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Live+At+Leeds+%5B40th+Anniversary+Edition%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d7a8fe580e8633be83fc152173ce19db3a32397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,122,143,229,128,232,99,59,232,63,193,82,23,60,225,157,179,163,35,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
