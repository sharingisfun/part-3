He was awarded the 1981 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1982 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and the 1990 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for impassioned writing with wide horizons, characterized by sensuous intelligence and humanistic integrity.&quot;  Ilan Stavans wrote that Paz was &quot;the quintessential surveyor, a Dante's Virgil, a Renaissance man.&quot;\n\nPerhaps his most famous work is THE LABYRINTH OF SOLITUDE (1950), a book-length essay that delves into the minds of his countrymen, describing them as hidden behind masks of solitude.  Due to their history, their identity is lost between a pre-Columbian and a Spanish culture, negating either.  A key work in understanding Mexican culture, it greatly influenced other Mexican writers, such as Carlos Fuentes. \n\nIn addition, this torrent presents a selection of Paz's poetry and a number of important essay collections, including ALTERNATING CURRENT, CONVERGENCES, THE OTHER MEXICO, and THE BOW AND THE LYRE.  Along with these are volumes of critical studies and biographies, including of MARCEL DUCHAMP and SOR JUANA, an analytical biography of Sor Juana InÃƒÂ©s de la Cruz, the Mexican 17th-century nun, feminist poet, mathematician, and thinker.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* AIRBORN / HIJOS DEL AIRE [with Charles Tomlinson] (Arcade, 1981).  \n\n* ALTERNATING CURRENT (Arcade, 1990).
