The five-piece was now seven, having added a new drummer and a woodwind player, and moving the man known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSnoopyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ over to keyboards. Even the cover of Da Capo reflected the transformation in its restaging of the first albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s photo.\nTheir sound had more jazz and classical effects, beginning with the harpsichord and sax all over the chaotic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStephanie Knows WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Arthur Lee sings all the songs on the album, even on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOrange SkiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, demonstrating Bryan MacLeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s propensity to write songs about ice cream. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ?Que Vida!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is wonderfully poetic, matching the Latin beat and an infectious finger-picked guitar. The mood is immediately destroyed by the marvelous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeven And Seven IsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, released earlier as a single that amazingly charted. Its galloping beat manages to stay steady all the way through the atomic explosion at the end. The challenges continue on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe CastleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, an extremely complicated yet mesmerizing composition. Slightly more straightforward is the should-have-been hit single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShe Comes In ColorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the title of which would in time be stolen by the Stones for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A RainbowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, while the main flute section would be stolen by Madonna for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeautiful StrangerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nWhile side one is a nearly perfect album side, the same cannot be said for side two. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevelationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a nineteen-minute jam framed by a harpsichord solo, otherwise consisting mostly of harmonica blasts and Arthur yelling over a boogie beat. (Oh, and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a drum solo too.) It may have been groundbreaking to have a single song take up an album side; after all, Dylan and Zappa did it, but those were at least double albums, and it also helps if the song is, you know, good. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevelationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is not. Maybe one must be high to appreciate it?\nStill, the quality of the six songs on side one makes Da Capo a worthy follow-up. (In fact, all of side one was included on RhinoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s excellent 1995 Love Story anthology, which would be essential had it also included all of the first album.) Today the album is only available as a download, but again, the 2002 Elektra Classic import CD has it in both mono and stereo, with excerpts from the recording sessions for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeven And Seven IsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Of course, that also means it includes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevelationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ twice.\n2002 reissue of 1967 classic features the original seven tracks in mono &amp; stereo with 'Seven &amp; Seven Is' (Tracking Session) added as a bonus. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2814443fd0eee397f044b05c9c825aebbf0234a","amp;dn":"Love+-+Da+Capo+%281967%2F2002%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2814443fd0eee397f044b05c9c825aebbf0234a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,129,68,67,253,14,238,57,127,4,75,5,201,200,37,174,187,240,35,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
