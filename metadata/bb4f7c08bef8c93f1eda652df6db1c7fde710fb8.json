Wendy is finally settling into the single life after struggling with the death of her husband. After a difficult season of grief, she's taken over the family business of coordinating the town's most beautiful and memorable weddings with the help of her friend and co-worker Roseanne (Kim Fields). Wendy's business and values are challenged, however, when the charming and incredibly irritating Marco opens shop as a divorce attorney right next to her wedding chapel. Although Wendy will stop at nothing to promote her marriage business over Marco's divorce business, she must form an alliance with Marco after her son Collin (Edward Ruttle) announces his unexpected engagement to Marco's daughter Sophia (Alicia Josipovic). As Wendy grows closer to Marco, she begins to realize that if she shields herself from the pain of love lost, she may prevent herself from experiencing true love in the future. Will Wendy open up to a second chance at love?\n\nCast: \n\nAntonio Cupo ... Marco \n \nLisa Whelchel ... Wendy \n \nKim Fields ... Roseanne \n \nAlicia Josipovic ... Sophia \n \nDavid Lewis ...
