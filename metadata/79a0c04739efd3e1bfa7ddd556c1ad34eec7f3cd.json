Its music video features a live performance by a band, all eight of whose members are played by AndrÃƒÂ© 3000, that mimicks the Beatles' 1964 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The song received praise from contemporary music critics, and won for Best Urban/Alternative Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards.\nAlong with &quot;The Way You Move&quot;, recorded by OutKast's other member Big Boi, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; was released by LaFace Records as one of the album's two lead singles. It became a commercial success, reaching the top five of most of the charts it entered, and topping the Billboard Hot 100 and the ARIA Singles Chart, among others: in 2009, Billboard named it as the 20th highest selling song of the 2000s decade in the United States. The song popularized the phrase &quot;shake it like a Polaroid picture&quot;, and the Polaroid Corporation used the song to revitalize the public's perception of its products.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a0c04739efd3e1bfa7ddd556c1ad34eec7f3cd","amp;dn":"Hey+Ya%21+-+OutKast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a0c04739efd3e1bfa7ddd556c1ad34eec7f3cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,160,192,71,57,239,211,225,191,167,221,213,86,193,173,52,238,199,243,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
