King (born September 16, 1925), known by the stage name B.B. King, is an American blues musician, singer, songwriter, and guitarist.\nRolling Stone magazine ranked him at No. 6 on its 2011 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time (previously ranked No. 3 in the 2003 edition of the same list),and he was ranked No. 17 in Gibson's &quot;Top 50 Guitarists of All Time&quot;.According to Edward M. Komara, King &quot;introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending and shimmering vibrato that would influence virtually every electric blues guitarist that followed.&quot;[3] King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He is considered one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname &quot;The King of Blues&quot;, and one of the &quot;Three Kings of the Blues Guitar&quot; (along with Albert King and Freddie King).King is also known for performing tirelessly throughout his musical career appearing at 250-300 concerts per year until his seventies. In 1956 it was noted that he appeared \nat 342 shows. King continues to appear at 100 shows a year.\nOver the years, King has developed one of the world's most identifiable guitar styles. He borrowed from Blind Lemon Jefferson, T-Bone Walker and others, integrating his precise and complex vocal-like string bends and his left hand vibrato, both of which have become indispensable components of rock guitarists' vocabulary. His economy and phrasing has been a model for thousands of players.King has mixed blues, jazz, swing, mainstream pop and jump into a unique sound. In King's words, &quot;When I sing, I play in my mind; the minute I stop singing orally, I start to sing by playing Lucille.&quot;\n\n====================================\n\nAlbum List\n\n(1956) B.B.
