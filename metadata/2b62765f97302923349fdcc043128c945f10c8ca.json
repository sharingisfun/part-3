Jew and American? How can we claim our own identities when our lives are linked so closely to othersâ€™? These are the questions at the heart of Jonathan Safran Foerâ€™s first novel in eleven yearsâ€”a work of extraordinary scope and heartbreaking intimacy.\r\n\r\nUnfolding over four tumultuous weeks in present-day Washington, D.C., Here I Am is the story of a fracturing family in a moment of crisis. As Jacob and Julia Bloch and their three sons are forced to confront the distances between the lives they think they want and the lives they are living, a catastrophic earthquake sets in motion a quickly escalating conflict in the Middle East. At stake is the meaning of homeâ€”and the fundamental question of how much aliveness one can bear.\r\n\r\nShowcasing the same high-energy inventiveness, hilarious irreverence, and emotional urgency that readers loved in his earlier work, Here I Am is Foerâ€™s most searching, hard-hitting, and grandly entertaining novel yet. It not only confirms Foerâ€™s stature as a dazzling literary talent but reveals a novelist who has fully come into his own as one of our most important writers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b62765f97302923349fdcc043128c945f10c8ca","amp;dn":"Here+I+Am+-+Jonathan+Safran+Foer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b62765f97302923349fdcc043128c945f10c8ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,98,118,95,151,48,41,35,52,159,220,192,67,18,140,148,95,16,200,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
