It is for people who want to have an advantage in everything that they say, write and do. It is for YOU if you want to find an edge--an advantage--in your work life. Much of The Unfair Advantage: Sell with NLP! is based on NLP (neurolinguistic programming) skills. But NLP is much more and much less than what is seen in this book. The techniques and skills here have been fine-tuned by the author for the last 30 years for only one purpose: to help sales and marketing professionals be more effective and successful. This book will teach you how to sell YOU, understand your prospects, and lead the sales process. The Revised Edition contains two new chapters that were not included in the 2000 edition (Mindsets or Metaprogams and Handling Objections). That is the only major change in the Revised Edition other than format and pricing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f6d6d780c6b6085b2961c5791e7a7687e31ee2","amp;dn":"The+Unfair+Advantage%3A+Sell+with+NLP%21%3A+Revised+Edition+by+Duane+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f6d6d780c6b6085b2961c5791e7a7687e31ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,246,214,215,128,198,182,8,91,41,97,197,121,30,122,118,135,227,30,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
