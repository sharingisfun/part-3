Under certain conditions, this could also lead to a crash.\n\nImporting a Session View clip containing automation for a Max for Live device into another Live Set would create automation breakpoints in the Arrangement View.\n\nWhen loop is activated in the Arrangement View, MIDI sustain messages and other CC# messages would not be recorded reliably after the first loop iteration.\n\nLive would allocate an unusually high amount of RAM when rendering video with the 64-bit version on OSX.\n\nWhen configuring plug-in parameters, some sliders in Live's plug-in panel would not match the position of the respective parameter in the plug-in GUI.\n\nAfter installing a newly purchased Pack, Live would show an error message and the Pack couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be used until Live was authorized manually again.\n\nText in deactivated clips was not readable with certain skins.\n\nFixed a crash that occurred when closing the plug-in window of a UAD Audio Unit by pressing the [ESC] key.\n\nFixed a crash which might occur when renaming a Drum Rack pad while triggering another pad.\n\nLive could crash under certain conditions when running as a ReWire slave and creating a new Live Set without saving the previous Set.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, Live would delete send automation or modulation envelopes from clips when exporting clips or tracks to the browser. Additionally, Live could crash when using the undo feature after such an export operation.\n\nChanges for Push:\nCertain Max for Live devices which accessed the Push Touch Strip would not work properly.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthepiratebay.se - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (07).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb1f051dc0530f630e18052914b46639a9562d9","amp;dn":"Ableton+Live+9.1.3+Suite+%2B+Authorize+%2864bit%29+-+OS+X+%5Bio%5D%5Bpacket-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb1f051dc0530f630e18052914b46639a9562d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,177,240,81,220,5,48,246,48,225,128,82,145,75,70,99,154,149,98,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
