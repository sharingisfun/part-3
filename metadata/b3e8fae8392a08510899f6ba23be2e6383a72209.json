When the young researcher washes up on an uncharted island after a shipwreck, she believes she's alone - until strange noises start coming from the shadows. Travel across the open island wilderness and through the tombs underground as ruthless predators stalk your every move. Adapt to your surroundings in a gritty battle to survive using your wits, brute strength, and whatever weapons you can find. Fight unflinching melee battles as the hunted becomes the hunter in a cinematic story tailor-made for Lara Croft.\n\nThis is Pal and NTSC even though the release name says just NTSC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3e8fae8392a08510899f6ba23be2e6383a72209","amp;dn":"Tomb.Raider.XBOX360-P2P+%5BPAL%2FNTSC-U%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3e8fae8392a08510899f6ba23be2e6383a72209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,232,250,232,57,42,8,81,8,153,246,186,35,190,46,99,131,167,34,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
