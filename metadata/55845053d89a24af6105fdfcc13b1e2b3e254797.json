Well it is worth the price of admission. As the title suggest it takes performances from all around the globe from 1987 through 1993 when the band was on their Lose Your Illusions tour. \n\nSlash, Izzy, and on a few tracks Gilby Clark play some killer guitar. Extended solos in some places and some all around impressive work always. Duff holds is own with Steven Adler and sometimes Matt Sorum. Axl's voice sounds pretty good through out and his interaction with the crowds is wonderful. \n\n'Welcome To The Jungle' is done fantastic. The intro is classic. 'Dust N' Bones' kicks; Izzy dominates here. The fact that they didn't leave of tracks from Lies is great as it is truly the bands best work. 'Patience' is chilling because the crowd almost over powers Rose. 'Used To Love Her' is as ruthless as always. 'Move To The City' is phenomenal. 'Rocket Queen' blows away the studio version as does 'Paradise City.' 'Estranged' could have been better but they all hated each other by then so that's alright. \n\nWhat really makes this worth owning is Axl's cover of Black Sabbaths 'Its Alright.' Absolutely stunning. Short, sweet, and brilliant. Take a listen and see what I mean because this has to be heard to appreciate. \n\nLive: Era is essential for the true GNR fan. Yeah there may be a better version of 'You Could Be Mine' but who has the time to find it on their own? \n\nby Morton\n\nTRACKLIST:\nDisc 1:\n01 - Nightrain.wma                                          \n02 - Mr. Brownstone.wma                                     \n03 - It's So Easy.wma                                       \n04 - Welcome To The Jungle.wma                              \n05 - Dust N' Bones.wma                                      \n06 - My Michelle.wma                                        \n07 - You're Crazy.wma                                       \n08 - Used To Love Her.wma                                   \n09 - Patience.wma                                           \n10 - It's Alright.wma                                       \n11 - November Rain.wma     \n\nDisc 2:\n01 - Out Ta Get Me.wma                                      \n02 - Pretty Tied Up.wma                                     \n03 - Yesterdays.wma                                         \n04 - Move To The City.wma                                   \n05 - You Could Be Mine.wma                                  \n06 - Rocket Queen.wma                                       \n07 - Sweet Child O' Mine.wma                                \n08 - Knockin' On Heaven's Door.wma                          \n09 - Don't Cry.wma                                          \n10 - Estranged.wma                                          \n11 - Paradise City.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55845053d89a24af6105fdfcc13b1e2b3e254797","amp;dn":"Guns+N%5C%27+Roses+-+Live+Era+%5C%2787+%5C%2793+%281999%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55845053d89a24af6105fdfcc13b1e2b3e254797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,132,80,83,216,154,36,175,97,5,253,252,193,59,30,43,62,37,71,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
