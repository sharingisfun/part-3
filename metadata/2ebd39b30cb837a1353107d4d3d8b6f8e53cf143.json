Now, with the recent advancements in synthesis technologies and the finding of new functional monomers, research in this field has shown strong potential in generating better property polymers from renewable resources. A text describing these advances in synthesis, processing, and technology of such polymers not only provides the stateÃ¢â‚¬â€œofÃ¢â‚¬â€œtheÃ¢â‚¬â€œart information to researchers, but also acts to stimulate research in this direction. The contents are based on a wide range of functional monomers and the contributions are written by eminent researchers.\n\nSpecifically Renewable Polymers:\n\nDemonstrates the design, synthesis, properties and applications of plant oilÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased polymers\n\nPresents an elaborate review of acid mediated polymerization techniques for the generation of green polymers\n\nDetails the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from olive oil based wastewater\n\nDescribes the use of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) techniques\n\nReviews the renewable polymers derived from transgenic crop plants\n\nProvides an overview of a range of biomassÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased polymers\n\nConcludes with the recent efforts and approaches exploiting the natural materials in developing drug delivery systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ebd39b30cb837a1353107d4d3d8b6f8e53cf143","amp;dn":"High+Performance+Polymers+and+Engineering+Plastics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ebd39b30cb837a1353107d4d3d8b6f8e53cf143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,189,57,179,12,184,55,161,53,49,7,212,211,216,182,248,229,60,241,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
