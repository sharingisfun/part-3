Like its predecessors, this edition requires few mathematical prerequisites. Only reasonable proficiency in algebra is required for an understanding of the concepts and methods underlying the calculations. The emphasis continues to be on an intuitive understanding of principles rather than an understanding based on mathematical sophistication. For most of the statistical techniques covered in this edition, we discuss the capabilities of one or more software packages (MINITAB, SAS, SPSS, and NCSS) that may be used to perform the calculations needed for their application. Resulting screen displays are also shown.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 INTRODUCTION TO BIOSTATISTICS 1\n2 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 19\n3 SOME BASIC PROBABILITY CONCEPTS 65\n4 PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS 92\n4.1 Introduction 93\n4.2 Probability Distributions of Discrete Variables 93\n5 SOME IMPORTANT SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS 134\n6 ESTIMATION 161\n7 HYPOTHESIS TESTING 214\n8 ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE 304\n9 SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION AND CORRELATION 413\n10 MULTIPLE REGRESSION AND CORRELATION 489\n11 REGRESSION ANALYSIS: SOME ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES 539\n12 THE CHI-SQUARE DISTRIBUTION AND THE ANALYSIS OF FREQUENCIES 600\n13 NONPARAMETRIC AND DISTRIBUTION-FREE STATISTICS 670\n14 SURVIVAL ANALYSIS 750\n15 VITAL STATISTICS (ONLINE)\nAPPENDIX: STATISTICAL TABLES A-1\nANSWERS TO ODD-NUMBERED\nEXERCISES A-107\nINDEX I-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:726930dca274d012d3dbb15c07574cb480b55fb8","amp;dn":"Biostatistics+-+A+Foundation+for+Analysis+in+the+Health+Sciences","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"726930dca274d012d3dbb15c07574cb480b55fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,105,48,220,162,116,208,18,211,219,177,92,7,87,76,180,128,181,95,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
