Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going easy on Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem, giving them one and a half problems for each heart, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got 15,000 problems,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he continues. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But for 2 and a half hours, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gonna make Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem forget about it, make Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem smile, kick their butts, and have a good time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re an Allman Brothers fan, this thing will break your heart. Meant as a celebration, paying homage to Gregg AllmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical legacy, the Rounder CD/DVD set is bittersweet, a glorious rendering of some of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classics.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great recreation of what once was and will never be again, due to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision to stop touring at the end of the year after Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks announced their departures from the band.\n\nBut the fact that its so true to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original state makes you miss Duane even more. His presence is paid homage to by Jack Pearson, who joined the band when Haynes left in Ã¢â‚¬â„¢97 and stayed till Ã¢â‚¬â„¢99. His work is outstanding and so close to DuaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eerie. You find yourself looking around onstage to see where that sound is coming from. Its hard to reconcile that sound with PearsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s low key stage presence. No rock god poses, no facial tics, no histrionics- just standing there and delivering Duane.\n\nThis is as close as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever get to the original power and glory of the young Allman Brothers Band of the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s. They sound as good as they did for 1971's Allman Brothers Live At Fillmore East. Gregg has never sounded better, apparently recovered from his 2010 liver transplant and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢12's back problems that forced him to cancel shows. He looks lean and sounds mean and mournful, his bluesy groan in tip-top shape.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Statesboro BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is recreated just as it was at the Fillmore, but with Taj Mahal out in front with his magnificent growl. MahalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version of the Blind Willie McTell classic on his eponymous Ã¢â‚¬â„¢68 debut reportedly was the inspiration for the Allmans recording it at the Fillmore. Allman slides in for the second verse, his bluesy, pain-wracked groans as good as his seventies self.\n\nJohn Hiatt adds a unique spin to Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Way Out,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ adding a folksy, butt rockinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ flavor while Black Crowes guitarist Audley Freed and Pearson do Dickie and Duane behind him and Jaimoe anchors the beat alongside studio superstar drummer Kenny Aronoff (Jefferson Airplane, Joe Cocker, Smashing Pumpkins, Johnny Cash.)\n\nOther cast members include Vince Gill, Dr. John, Susan Tedeschi, Keb Mo, Devon Allman, Sam Moore, Robert Randolph, Jackson Browne, Martina McBride, Trace Adkins, Eric Church, and Wet WillieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jimmy Hall.\n\nLooking like a slightly less weathered version of Keith Richards, Hall turns in a blistering performance on Ã¢â‚¬Å“You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Lose What You Never HadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ over the top of equally blistering backup from RandolphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pedal steel and Devon AllmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crunchy licks.\n\nThe finale, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Will the Circle Be Unbroken,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with the entire cast onstage, gets off to a ragged start with Allman having trouble finding the melody, his vocal weak and off key perhaps because of being unable to hear himself over the thundering horde of talent banging away. But church commences as as soon as Taj Mahal takes over, and remains in charge throughout, his gruff exhortations punctuating everybody elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solos. Sam Moore chimes in with more churchy soul, former Allman Brother and current Stones keyboardist Chuck Leavell throws in some Van Dyke Parks-worthy piano licks and Dr. John brings a big forkful of gumbo fonk to the mix.\n\nBut this one wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t end here. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so much good stuff sprinkled throughout that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have trouble taking this one out of your viewing device, trawling through it again and again to bask in the eternal glory of the AllmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soulful blues legacy.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1715a8ab6d9dd88ca5f2817bd7fad4c09fbd2bb","amp;dn":"VA+-+All+My+Friends+Songs+%26amp%3B+Voice+of+Gregg+Allman+%282014%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1715a8ab6d9dd88ca5f2817bd7fad4c09fbd2bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,113,90,138,182,217,221,136,202,95,40,23,189,127,173,76,9,251,210,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
