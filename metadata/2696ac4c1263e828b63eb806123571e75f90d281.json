A decade earlier, Motown dipped their toe in the water with the jumbled Back to Front, which tried desperately to camouflage its nature as a comp with three new songs, which, at 14 tracks, hurt the hit quotient dramatically. This, however, gets it almost all right. Spanning 20 tracks (only two of which are new, tacked onto the end; while not especially memorable, neither is bad), this collection has nearly all the big hits from his solo recordings (the Top Ten &quot;Love Will Conquer All&quot; is notably absent, but that's the only chart-topper not here), along with five Commodores ballads that showcase Richie the balladeer at a peak: &quot;Just to Be Close to You,&quot; &quot;Easy,&quot; &quot;Three Times a Lady,&quot; &quot;Still,&quot; &quot;Sail On.&quot; Since these were the first tracks to showcase Lionel Richie as a talent separate from the Commodores, their presence is welcome on a collection of his solo hits, and they indeed make this a fuller experience, since this now has all of Richie's soft rock hits in one place. Taken together, it's a formidable body of work, making a clear case for him as one of the preeminent soft rock craftsmen of the early '80s. True, the collection might have benefited slightly from a chronological track listing, but by jumping between albums, and between Commodores and solo material, the consistency of his records becomes evident. Few of his peers created singles as memorable as &quot;Easy,&quot; the infectious &quot;All Night Long (All Night),&quot; &quot;Truly,&quot; the sweetly melancholic &quot;Hello,&quot; the insistent, gently ominous &quot;Running with the Night,&quot; &quot;Just to Be Close to You,&quot; and the ebullient &quot;You Are,&quot; as delightful as 45s came in the early days of the Reagan Administration. Not everything here quite reaches those standards -- admittedly, those are the hits upon which his reputation lay, plus they're the best that soft pop got in the '80s -- but the rest is all well-crafted and easily enjoyable, proving that Lionel Richie is a singular adult contemporary talent. He may be sappy, but he's got skills. \n- Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] All Night Long\n[02] Say You, Say Me\n[03] My Destiny\n[04] Running With The Night\n[05] Dancing On The Ceiling\n[06] Don't Stop The Music\n[07] Love, Oh Love\n[08] Ballerina Girl\n[09] My Love\n[10] Love Will Conquer All\n[11] Do It To Me\n[12] Cinderella\n[13] Tender Heart\n[14] Don't Wanna Lose You\n[15] Closest Thing To Heaven\n[16] I Forgot\n[17] Angel\n[18] To Love A Woman (Featuring Enrique Iglesias)\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:19m:38s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Three Times A Lady\n[02] Easy\n[03] Endless Love (Duet With Diana Ross)\n[04] Hello\n[05] Still\n[06] Sail On\n[07] Stuck On You\n[08] You Are\n[09] Truly\n[10] Just To Be Close To You\n[11] Sweet Love\n[12] Penny Lover\n[13] Oh No\n[14] Lady (You Bring Me Up)\n[15] Wonderland\n[16] Machine Gun\n[17] Brickhouse\n[18] Too Hot To Trot\n[19] Flying High\n[20] Zoom\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:16m:55s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 02h:36m:33s\nTotal File Size....................... 993mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
