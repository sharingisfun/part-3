He is known for making experimental electronic music often in odd numbered time signatures. He is an unusually prolific artist, having released records on the History of the Future, Isolate/DySLeXiC ResPonSe, Addict, Zod, Distort, Sublight, Low-Res, Planet Mu and Hymen record labels.\n\nHis style has been critically acclaimed, notably by the late British radio disc jockey John Peel.\n\nVenetian Snares composes much of his music with trackers. Before he began to release his music commercially, he worked primarily with OctaMED on an Amiga 500. At some point prior to 2000, he began using a PC and the Windows port of OctaMED, MED Soundstudio. Today he works also with Renoise.\n\nThe covers for four of his releases have been illustrated by central British artist Trevor Brown. In Brown&amp;#039;s usual style, these covers feature airbrushes of young girls in sexual or violent scenes.\n\nVenetian Snares&amp;#039; latest full length album titled My Downfall (Original Soundtrack) has been confirmed by Mike Paradinas for a 2007 release on Planet Mu. It&amp;#039;s considered to be a follow up to Rossz Csillag Alatt SzÃƒÂ¼letett.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBreakcore is a loosely defined extreme electronic music style that brings together elements of jungle, hardcore techno, IDM, mashup, industrial music and noise into a breakbeat-oriented sound that encourages speed, complexity and maximum sonic density.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4360e143313187c308fab4409a67b7864490064","amp;dn":"Venetian+Snares+Discography+%281999+-+2007%29+%5BBreakcore+IDM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4360e143313187c308fab4409a67b7864490064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,54,14,20,51,19,24,124,48,143,171,68,9,166,123,120,100,73,0,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
