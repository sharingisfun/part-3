Disc 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFunked UpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the follow-up to Candy's successful Candy Store album. The album is filled with the Funk and R&amp;B that she injects into her live performances but seldom brings into the studio. Disc 2, Chilled Out, contains relaxed, mellow grooves for those late night hours, inspired by the music that Candy and producer Thomas Bank composed for the soundtrack the wine documentary 'Kissed By The Grape'. \n\nCandy's website: http://www.candydulfer.nl/\n\nCredits to the original Uploader\n\n\nCheck my Candy's Discography:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4410495/Candy_Dulfer_-_Discography_(1989-2007)_%5Bmp3_320%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4410495/Candy_Dulfer_-_Discography_(1989-2007)_%5Bmp3_320%5D&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2da6813ed15c5778ea7c4c0ce1dfd6bf122b18f","amp;dn":"Candy+Dulfer+-+Funked+Up+%26+Chilled+Out+%5B2CD%5D+%282009%29+%5Bmp3%40224%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2da6813ed15c5778ea7c4c0ce1dfd6bf122b18f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,218,104,19,237,21,197,119,142,167,196,192,206,29,253,107,241,34,177,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
