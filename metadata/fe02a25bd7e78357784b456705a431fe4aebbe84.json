Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a testament to immense talent and the elusive endowment of staying power.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn the summer of 2010, COCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s founding membersÃ¢â‚¬â€bassist/vocalist Mike Dean, drummer/vocalist Reed Mullin and guitarist Woody WeathermanÃ¢â‚¬â€gathered at WeathermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s farm in Virginia to get to work again after a five-year hiatus. With longtime vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan busy working with metal supergroup Down back home in New Orleans, COC began playing together as a three-piece for the first time since the mid-1980s.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same lineup behind 1985Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Animosity, widely considered a crossover classic. While the trio re-visited songs from that album and 1987Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Technocracy, this was not just an exercise in nostalgia, and they soon began writing new material.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“It was a little strange at first but pretty quickly it felt like we hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t missed a beat,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ recalled Dean.\n\nAfter touring the U.S. and Europe with bands including Goatsnake and Clutch, and appearances at festivals like Deathfest and Roadburn,, COC joined with longtime producer John Custer in early 2011 to begin recording what would be the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first release since 2005Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s critically acclaimed In the Arms of God, which featured Stanton Moore of Galactic on the drums filling in for an injured Mullin. COC recorded all 11 tracks at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 in Los Angeles with help from Foo Fighters' engineer John Lousteau.\n\nDuring the sessions, Custer commented on COCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncanny ability when in the studio to Ã¢â‚¬Å“behave as a single organism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCorrosion of Conformity was officially released on February 28, 2012, with artwork that features a revamp of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iconic spiked-skull logo by Seldon Hunt (Melvins, High on Fire). Critics and fans alike have greeted it warmly.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Corrosion of Conformity not only brings back one of heavy rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most seminal and defining bands, but it pushes that band into new ground itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never yet known,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ observed The Obelisk. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The achievement is substantial, the performances crisp, the production clear but organic, but sure enough, these elements and the varied aesthetic of the band come together to create something wholly stronger than its parts.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCorrosion of Conformity is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first release with Candlelight, which has also hosted bands including Opeth and Orange Goblin. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Animosity is one of my favorite records ever,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said CandlelightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Steve Beatty. Ã¢â‚¬Å“To have COC on Candlelight with that line-up is simply mouthwatering.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe band plans to embark on a world tour starting in the United States in March 2012, including three performances at this year's SXSW Music Conference in Austin. Joining them for most of those U.S. dates will be Torche, Valient Thorr and A Storm of LightÃ¢â‚¬â€a lineup that Dean noted is Ã¢â‚¬Å“really compatible without every band doing the same thing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ COC will then head to Europe and the UK with Black Cobra and Zoroaster.\n\nThe original members of COC are excited to be working together again.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Mike, Woody and I essentially learned how to play music together and cultivated our own style, sound, and unspoken language,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Mullin. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Re-bonding with them musically has been the greatest thing thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever happened to me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nWoodroe Weatherman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\nMike Dean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, vocals\nReed Mullin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, vocals\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
