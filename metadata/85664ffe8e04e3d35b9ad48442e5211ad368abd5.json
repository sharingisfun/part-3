Marghitu, &quot;Mechanical Engineer's Handbook (Engineering)&quot;\nAcademic Press | 2001 | ISBN: 012471370X | 880 pages | PDF\n\nThe Mechanical Engineer's Handbook was developed and written specifically to fill a need for mechanical engineers and mechanical engineering students throughout the world. With over 1000 pages, 550 illustrations, and 26 tables the Mechanical Engineer's Handbook is very comprehensive, yet affordable, compact, and durable. The Handbook covers all major areas of mechanical engineering with succinct coverage of the definitions, formulas, examples, theory, proofs, and explanations of all principle subject areas. The Handbook is an essential, practical companion for all mechanical engineering students with core coverage of nearly all relevant courses included. Also, anyone preparing for the engineering licensing examinations will find this handbook to be an invaluable aid. Useful analytical techniques provide the student and practicing engineer with powerful tools for mechanical design.\n\nThis book is designed to be a portable reference with a depth of coverage not found in &quot;pocketbooks&quot; of formulas and definitions and without the verbosity, high price, and excessive size of the huge encyclopedic handbooks. If an engineer needs a quick reference for a wide array of information, yet does not have a full library of textbooks or does not want to spend the extra time and effort necessary to search and carry a six pound handbook, this book is for them.\n\nCovers all major areas of mechanical engineering with succinct coverage of the definitions, formulae, examples, theory, proofs and explanations of all principle subject areas\nBoasts over 1000 pages, 550 illustrations, and 26 tables\nIs comprehensive, yet affordable, compact, and durable with strong 'flexible' binding\nPossesses a true handbook 'feel' in size and design with a full colour cover, thumb index, cross-references and useful printed endpapers ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85664ffe8e04e3d35b9ad48442e5211ad368abd5","amp;dn":"Mechanical+Engineer%5C%27s+Handbook+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85664ffe8e04e3d35b9ad48442e5211ad368abd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,102,79,254,142,4,227,211,91,154,212,132,66,229,33,26,211,104,171,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
