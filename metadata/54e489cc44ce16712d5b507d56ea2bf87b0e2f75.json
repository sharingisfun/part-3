From then on the Cinema Novo (an avant-garde Brazilian cinema) started having international repercussion.\n\nThe director of the polemic and stimulant motion picture was by that time a 25 year old young man who started his career in the cinema with the performance of the following short-length experimental pictures: &quot;PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡tio &quot; (1957) and &quot;Cruz na PraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a&quot; (1959). He also finished &quot;Barravento &quot; ( 1962), a long-length motion picture started by Luis Paulino dos Santos. These works as well as the tasks he carried out as a cinema reviewer had already high-lighted his name in the intellectual circles of Salvador city where he was considered one of the young Brazilian cineasts of that epoch.\n\nWith the protesting text &quot;A EstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tica da Fome&quot; and the issue of the scenario of &quot;Deus e o Diabo&quot;, in the following year he achieved fame.\n\nIn 1966, while he was waiting for the beginning of his new motion picture, Glauber Rocha produced two short length documentaries as follows: &quot;Amazonas Amazonas&quot; and &quot;MaranhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o 66&quot;; the plot of the last one referring to the entrance into office of the then Governor JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Sarney. The next film, &quot;Terra em Transe&quot; got also distinction and prizes of the international review. Before his third long-length motion picture, he had a new experience, &quot;Cancer&quot;; and then, with the film &quot;O DragÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o da Maldade Contra o Santo Guerreiro&quot; he got the prize of the best motion picture director of Cannes Festival, in 1969.\n\nThis prize gave him the opportunity to work abroad producing the following films: &quot;Der Leone Have Sept CabeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§as&quot; (1969) a French/Italian joint-production filmed in Africa; &quot;CabeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§as Cortadas&quot; (1970) filmed in Spain; &quot;HistÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ria do Brasil&quot; (1974) which had Marcos Medeiros as a joint-director, filmed in Cuba and Italy; and &quot;Claro&quot; an Italian production dating from 1975.\n\nOnce again, in 1977, he was awarded a prize at Cannes Festival with the performance of the short-length &quot;Di Cavalcanti&quot;, a homage he paid to his friend, the painter Di Cavalcanti, who had recently died. This very polemical film was interdicted by the painter's family.\n\n&quot;A Idade da Terra&quot; (1978) which had in its cast the following artists: Norma Bengell, Jece ValadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o, Ana Maria MagalhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£es and Geraldo del Rey, was performed at the International Cinema Exhibition of Venice and got controversial and enthusiastic opinions. About this motion picture the Italian Michelangelo Antonioni said: &quot;each scene is a lesson showing how modern cinema has to be done&quot;.\n\nIn August 1981, Glauber Rocha came back from Portugal very sick and died on 22nd of the same month. During his funeral, many friends admirers and artists were present and immediately started to study Glauber Rocha's work. Little by little, they realized that his work was much larger than they had imagined. At the present time his works are kept at Tempo Glauber, a museum and center of studies containing documents about cinema, scripts that were never filmed, poems, plays, original books which had never been issued and drawings. They are examples which prove that Glauber Rocha's work is still enthusiastic and alive.\n\n=========================================\n\nExtras:\nInterview with cast\nTrailer\nRevies of the time\nThe hinterland of Glauber\nScreemplay\nPhoto Galery\nPublicity of the time\nThe restauration\nTechnical cast\n\n=========================================\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name:                                      Deus.e.o.Diabo.na.Terra.do.Sol_Glauber.Rocha.DVDRip.Xvid.AC3.avi                     \nFile Size (in bytes):                           1,940,502,528                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             96          \nPreload (in ms):                                32       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Split         \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:58:52                \nFrame Count:                                    170990             \nFrame Width x Height (pixels):                  640 x 480 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;                    1.333                     \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:                              23.976          \nPics Per Second:                                23.976            \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1722                 \nMPEG-4:                                         MPEG-4                   \n[B-VOP][QPel][GMC][NVOP][H264]:                 [B-VOP][][][][]   \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.234&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nMPEG Stream ID (e.g. &quot;0xbd&quot;):                             \nMPEG VOB file Substream(e.g. &quot;0x80&quot;):                  \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            448                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            CBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      6\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e489cc44ce16712d5b507d56ea2bf87b0e2f75","amp;dn":"Deus+e+o+Diabo+na+Terra+do+Sol+aka+Black+God+White+Devil+%5B%2B+Extr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e489cc44ce16712d5b507d56ea2bf87b0e2f75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,228,137,204,68,206,22,113,45,91,80,125,86,234,43,248,123,14,47,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
