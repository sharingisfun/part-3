Each tells the story of a planetary invasion by men on a do-or-die mission.\n\n&quot;An Army of One&quot; by B. V. Larson (a novella in Star Force series) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ One man attempts to stay neutralÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and fails. The Macros are invading from the skies. The only nanotized man who isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t officially part of Star Force learns how hard it can be to avoid an interstellar war.\n\n&quot;First Conquest&quot; by David VanDyke (Book #1 Stellar Conquest) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In 2115, EarthFleet sends its best warships and bravest Marines on a one-way trip to conquer an alien star system, to win or die trying.\n\n&quot;Cyborgs!&quot; by Vaughn Heppner (a novella set in the Doom Star series) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Space Marines are in the Oort Cloud, racing in their insertion pods to the frozen planetoid of Tyche. Alone in the dark, outnumbered and outgunned by the cyborgs waiting for them on the methane-ice surface, the hour of desperation has arrived. \n\n\n\nby B.V.
