And why does so much of our knowledge remain unconscious? Thanks to clever psychological and brain-imaging experiments, scientists are closer to cracking this mystery than ever before.\n\n In this lively book, Stanislas Dehaene describes the pioneering work his lab and the labs of other cognitive neuroscientists worldwide have accomplished in defining, testing, and explaining the brain events behind a conscious state. We can now pin down the neurons that fire when a person reports becoming aware of a piece of information and understand the crucial role unconscious computations play in how we make decisions. The emerging theory enables a test of consciousness in animals, babies, and those with severe brain injuries.\n\n A joyous exploration of the mind and its thrilling complexities, Consciousness and the Brain will excite anyone interested in cutting-edge science and technology and the vast philosophical, personal, and ethical implications of finally quantifying consciousness.\n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c3245d303264b84319fc3089b58ed113b3be899","amp;dn":"Consciousness+and+the+Brain%3A+Deciphering+How+the+Brain+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c3245d303264b84319fc3089b58ed113b3be899","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,50,69,211,3,38,75,132,49,159,195,8,155,88,237,17,59,59,232,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
