The High-Rider Gnome has journeyed long from his hidden grotto in the tropics to join you in The Sims 4. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eagerly awaiting your arrival in Build Mode, ready to grace your homes with his feats of stationary flamingo bronco busting!\nLook for him in Build Mode in the Outdoors or Decorations sorts, or type Gnome in the search box.\nSim and object highlights can now be toggled on/off by entering hovereffects on/off in the cheat console (this will eliminate the white border on a Sim or an object when you hover over it to interact). In addition, you can add -nohovereffects to the Command Line Arguments. In order to add the argument:\nOpen the Origin client, right click on The Sims 4 game box art, select Ã¢â‚¬Å“View Game PropertiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, click Ã¢â‚¬Å“Game PropertiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, enter -nohovereffects into the text box, and then click Apply.\n\nBug Fixes / Issues\nFixed an issue with some gallery downloads that were causing the game to hang.\nFixed several bugs that would result in incorrect relationship states between Sims.\nFor players using the Ã¢â‚¬Å“cas.fulleditmodeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ cheat to go back and adjust Sims after theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been created, note that using this cheat will still allow you to manually select invalid relationships. Please exercise caution when changing relationships while using this cheat.\nThe automated filtering used for Gallery uploads was unintentionally blocking the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“gayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“homosexualÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“homosapienÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. It has now been fixed and these terms will not be blocked or prevented.\nFixed a crash that would result if a block without walls was saved as a room.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Copy update files over the main folder (overwrite)\n2. Copy Crack\n3. Go to My documentsElectronic ArtsThe Sims 4 and delete everything except folders Saves and mods BEFORE you run the game\n4. ...\n5. Profit\n\nOrigin is still Required\n\n\nAll credit goes to 3DM team and their amazing work\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50a227dd21829fa6d8d448e53edc28b16d5ba9c","amp;dn":"The.Sims.4.Update.2.and.Crack.v5-3DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50a227dd21829fa6d8d448e53edc28b16d5ba9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,10,34,125,210,24,41,250,109,141,68,142,83,237,194,139,22,213,186,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
