She is returned to England to live at her uncle&amp;#039;s castle. Her uncle is very distant due to the loss of his wife ten years before. Neglected once again, she begins exploring the estate and discovers a garden that has been locked and neglected. Aided by one of the servants&amp;#039; boys, she begins restoring the garden, and eventually discovers some other secrets of the manor.\nWritten by Ed Sutton\n\n\nC O M M E N T S\n\nMesmerizing, beautifully acted family film, 27 August 1999\nAuthor: Tommy-92 from baltimore, maryland \n\nWhile I have called The Secret Garden a family film, that doesn&amp;#039;t mean it&amp;#039;s just for children. It is a film for all ages, and sure to be enjoyed by all of them, too. A vivid and affecting film, it&amp;#039;s got many things going for it: mesmerizing cinemetography and time-lapse photography, a good music score and script, breathtaking sets, wonderful direction, great acting, even gorgeous flowers! Agneiska Holland does a great job at bringing out all the subtle little points and details in the story and great performances from her young cast, particularly from Kate Maberly as Mary. Heydon Prowse is good, too, as Colin, and so is Maggie Smith as Mrs. Medlock, the frusterated, overprotective housekeeper who seems to be mean, but really is only doing what she thinks best. One of the few films I&amp;#039;ve seen that I can call perfect with conviction; definitely should be seen and appreciated. \n\n\nBE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n\nENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6742d8ffe9da4ea7ecf38660abd9d761814e1e75","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Garden%5B1993%5DDvDrip%5B720x576%5DAC3%5B2ch%5D%5BEng%5D-RHooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6742d8ffe9da4ea7ecf38660abd9d761814e1e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,66,216,255,233,218,78,167,236,243,134,96,171,217,215,97,129,78,30,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
