It is envisaged that the work of this book will help to re-define how we can better visualise Space and Place, considering: Science, Technology and Art.\nThe book is therefore a celebration of the meeting point between Art and Cartography. It provides a starting point for a journey that will explore innovative methods and techniques for representing our world using the complementary techniques from Art, Science and technology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bff049a175040070aa1b081b1b2935a9defbb8e","amp;dn":"Cartography+and+Art+%28History+Maps+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bff049a175040070aa1b081b1b2935a9defbb8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,255,4,154,23,80,64,7,10,161,176,129,177,178,147,90,157,239,187,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
