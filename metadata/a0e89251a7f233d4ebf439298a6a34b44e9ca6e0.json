rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/edit/5629784&lt;/a&gt;  Sonnox Elite Oxford Plugins AU VST RTAS MAC OSX INTEL \n\n\n\n\n\nMaking paths, logos, and lines come to life\n\n\nWith 3D Stroke, paths, logos, or lines can take on lives of their own: glowing, tapering, and moving in complex ways through 3D space, while a \n\nbuilt-in camera lets you capture the action from any angle. It's broadcast TV's secret weapon for animated logos and sophisticated write-on effects. \n\n\n\n\nTrapcode Echospace 1.0\n\n\nPainless control of 3D layer instances\nEchospace takes the tedium out of working with multiple layer instances in After Effects. Begin with an image, text, footage, or even compositions, and \n\nEchospace will create multiple versions of that layer that can be controlled as a group or individually. Movement and effects can ripple through the stack ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nwith offset and delay controls and much more.\n\n\n\n\nTrapcode Horizon 1.0\n\n\nA camera-aware image mapping tool\n\nGive your compositions what they've been missing with this unique mapping tool. The Trapcode Horizon plug-in is a camera-aware image mapping tool that ties \n\nyour After Effects camera to a 3D world. By applying images or gradients to the inside of a giant sphere, Horizon creates an infinite background. \n\nNo matter where your camera is directed, the simple controls make photorealistic backgrounds or sky gradients a snap. \n\n\n\nTrapcode Lux 1.0\n\n\nA way to see the light in After Effects\n\nThe 3D lighting feature in After Effects creates pools of light generated from light sources in 3D space ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but you can't see the light itself or the cone \n\nit produces. Enter Trapcode Lux: a speedy plug-in that adds volumetric lighting effects to projects that require realistic spotlights, point lights, or \n\nstage lighting of all kinds. (Now published by Red Giant Software.)\n\n\n\n\nTrapcode Particular 1.5\n\nQuick-rendering 3D particles with full camera integration and natural behavior\n\nMany editing programs offer basic particle-generation features. But Trapcode Particular goes way beyond the basics, with real-time interactive previews, \n\nbouncing particles, 3D camera integration, particles that emit particles, custom shapes, air resistance, gravity and turbulence controls, depth of field, \n\nand more. Get the effects seen in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpider-Man 3.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nTrapcode Shine\n\nUltra-fast light ray effects\n\nCreate compelling light effects without leaving your editing timeline, and without the tedious render times of specialized 3D applications. \n\nSunshine through clouds, headlights through fog, or horror movie titles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Shine does it all. Choose from 22 powerful presets, or make your own light ray \n\neffects from scratch. With 16-bit and 32-bit support , Trapcode Shine guarantees high-quality light effects for any project. \n\n\n\nTrapcode Sound Keys\n\nEasy audio-to-video synchronization\n\nAudio-intensive animations no longer require time-consuming hand tweaking of keyframes. Trapcode Sound Keys makes it easy to synchronize motion and sound \n\nin After Effects using either amplitude or frequency ranges. Unlike palette-based audio-sync products, Sound Keys is applied as a regular effect, making \n\nit possible to save settings with your project, generate keyframes into output parameters, and link keyframes to expressions. \n\n\n\nTrapcode Starglow\n\nDazzling effects to transform ordinary highlights\n\nStarglow is a fast-rendering multidirectional glow effect. It can be used to create multicolored star-shaped glints like those created by a camera filter. \n\nEach customizable glow consists of up to eight directions, and each direction can be assigned an individual color map and streak length offering endless \n\npossibilities.\n\n\n\n######################################  SERIALS INCLUDED  ######################################\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0e89251a7f233d4ebf439298a6a34b44e9ca6e0","amp;dn":"Trapcode+Plugins+3D+Stroke+2.5+-+Adobe+CS5+2010+by+TDK3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0e89251a7f233d4ebf439298a6a34b44e9ca6e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,232,146,81,167,242,51,212,235,244,57,41,138,106,52,180,78,156,166,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
