Marieb began her teaching career at Springfield College, where she taught A&amp;P to physical education majors.  She then joined the faculty of the Biological Science Division of Holyoke Community College with a Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. As a result of her contact with her students at Holyoke Community College, many of whom were pursuing degrees in nursing, she developed a desire to better understand the relationship between the scientific study of the human body and the clinical aspects of nursing practice.  Still teaching full-time, Dr. Marieb pursued her nursing education, which culminated in a Master of Science degree with a clinical specialization in gerontology from the University of Massachusetts.  It is this experience, along with stories from the fieldÃƒÂ¢??including those of former students now in health careersÃƒÂ¢??that has informed the development of the unique perspective and accessibility for which her texts and laboratory manuals are known.  \n\n\n\nKatja Hoehn is an instructor in the Department of Chemical, Biological, and Environmental Sciences at Mount Royal College in Calgary, Canada. She received her M.D. (with Distinction) from the University of Saskatchewan, and her Ph.D. in Pharmacology from Dalhousie University. Dr. Hoehn has been a contributor to several books and has written numerous research papers in Neuroscience and Pharmacology.  In 1991, the Dalhousie Medical Research Foundation presented her with the Max Forman (Jr.) Prize for excellence in medical research.  During her 11 years at Mount Royal College, Dr. Hoehn has received numerous awards including a PanCanadian Educational Technology Faculty Award (1999), a Teaching Excellence Award from the StudentÃƒÂ¢??s Association of Mount Royal College (2001), and the Mount Royal College Distinguished Faculty Teaching award (2004).  She is also actively involved in the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS). \n\n:-D \n\nThanks to the original uploader RPALA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b615d7ae9bd3c5debba50f5e4c8285b52a33ecb","amp;dn":"%28Medical%29+Human+anatomy+and+physiology+7th+ed+-+Marieb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b615d7ae9bd3c5debba50f5e4c8285b52a33ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,97,93,122,233,189,60,93,235,186,80,245,228,200,40,91,82,163,62,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
