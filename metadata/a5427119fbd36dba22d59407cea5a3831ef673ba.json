This time the choir teams up with the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra in a mixed program of chamber orchestra, choral, and choral a cappella works. The main course on this CD is the rarely recorded and monumental Te Deum. Young Estonian conductor Risto Joost delivers a reading that is rich and inspired.\r\n\r\nSince the 2011/2012 season, Risto Joost has been the principal conductor of the Netherlands Chamber Choir who accompany him on this new recording from Globe.\r\n\r\nHe has swiftly identified himself as one of the worldâ€™s leading exponents of Arvo PÃ¤rtâ€™s music and this disc is sure to be one of his best recordings.\r\n\r\nThe recording presents Arvo PÃ¤rtâ€™s probably most well known vocal and instrumental works composed from 1992-2000, all of which have found their place in the repertoire of the leading vocal ensembles and orchestras in the world. The Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, under the passionate leadership of Gordon Nikolic is a great example of a modern chamber orchestra, very capable of performing any style of music.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Wallfahrtslied (1985)\r\n02 - Orient and Occident (2000)\r\n03 - Nunc dimittis (2001)\r\n04 - Fratres (1997)\r\n05 - Te Deum Verses 1-4 (1984-85 rev 2007)\r\n06 - Te Deum Verses 5-6 (1984-85 rev 2007)\r\n07 - Te Deum Verses 7-9 (1984-85 rev 2007)\r\n08 - Te Deum Verses 10-12 (1984-85 rev 2007)\r\n09 - Te Deum Verses 13-15 (1984-85 rev 2007)\r\n10 - Te Deum Verses 16-17 (1984-85 rev 2007)\r\n\r\n* 2012 Globe / KPP | GLO5252\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nGordan Nikolic violin\r\nNetherlands Chamber Choir\r\nNetherlands Chamber Orchestra\r\nRisto Joost Conductor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Arvo Part Album's....\r\n\r\n\r\nArvo Part - Choral &amp; Instrumental Works (2004) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/13070235/Arvo_Part_-_Choral__amp__Instrumental_Works_%282004%29_[2CD]_[EAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5427119fbd36dba22d59407cea5a3831ef673ba","amp;dn":"Arvo+Part+-+Te+Deum+%282012%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5427119fbd36dba22d59407cea5a3831ef673ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,66,113,25,251,211,109,186,34,213,148,7,206,165,163,131,30,246,115,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
