Although assembly language is commonly used for writing device drivers, emulators, and video games, many programmers find its somewhat unfriendly syntax intimidating to learn and use. Since 1996, Randall Hydes The Art of Assembly Language has provided a comprehensive, plain-English, and patient introduction to assembly for non-assembly programmers. Hydes primary teaching tool, High Level Assembler (or HLA), incorporates many of the features found in high-level languages (like C, C++, and Java) to help you quickly grasp basic assembly concepts. HLA lets you write true low-level code while enjoying the benefits of high-level language programming. As you read The Art of Assembly Language, you will learn the low-level theory fundamental to computer science and turn that understanding into real, functional code. You will learn how to: Edit, compile, and run an HLA program Declare and use constants, scalar variables, pointers, arrays, structures, unions, and namespaces Translate arithmetic expressions (integer and floating point) Convert high-level control structures This much anticipated second edition of The Art of Assembly Language has been updated to reflect recent changes to HLA and to support Linux, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD. Whether you are new to programming or you have experience with high-level languages, The Art of Assembly Language, 2nd Edition is your essential guide to learning this complex, low-level language. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e174ea0d9d7e471e7beff9b0190d7a57bef2b7e","amp;dn":"The++Art++of++Assembly++Language++Second++Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e174ea0d9d7e471e7beff9b0190d7a57bef2b7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,23,78,160,217,215,228,113,231,190,255,155,1,144,215,165,123,239,43,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
