They disbanded in 1973 and lead singer Paul Rodgers went on to become a frontman of the band Bad Company along with Simon Kirke on drums. Lead guitarist Paul Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler and died from a drug-induced heart failure at the age of 25 in 1976. Bassist Andy Fraser formed Sharks. \n\nThe band was famed for its sensational live shows and nonstop touring. However, early studio albums did not sell very well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until the release of Fire and Water which featured the massive hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;. The song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival 1970 where they played to 600,000 people. \n\nBy the early 1970s, Free was one of the biggest-selling British blues-rock groups; by the time the band dissolved in 1973, they had sold more than 20 million albums around the world and had played more than 700 arena and festival concerts. &quot;All Right Now,&quot; remains a rock staple, and had been entered into ASCAP's &quot;One Million&quot; airplay singles club\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    Waiting on You\n    Sugar for Mr Morrision\n    I'm a Mover\n    Over the Green Hills\n    Songs of Yesterday\n    Broad Daylight\n    Woman [In Session]\n    I'll Be Creepin'\n    Trouble on Double Time\n    Mouthful of Grass\n    All Right Now [In Session]\n    Fire and Water\n    Be My Friend [In Session][Take]\n    Be My Friend [In Session][Take]\n    Ride on a Pony [In Session][Take]\n    Ride on a Pony [In Session][Take]\n    Ride on a Pony [In Session][Take]\n    Ride on a Pony [In Session][Take]\n    Ride on a Pony [In Session][Take]\n    Get Where I Belong\n    The Hunter\n    Woman [In Concert]\n    Free Me\n    Remember\n    Fire and Water\n    Be My Friend [In Concert]\n    Ride on a Pony [In Concert]\n    Mr Big\n    Don't Say You Love Me\n    Woman [In Concert]\n    All Right Now [In Concert]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e1ea565a7df6cf2d8870c8fa159a42efcfe76c0","amp;dn":"Free+-+Live+At+The+BBC+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e1ea565a7df6cf2d8870c8fa159a42efcfe76c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,30,165,101,167,223,108,242,216,135,12,143,161,89,164,46,252,254,118,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
