The film opens with Curtis landing on the freewheeling, all-male asteroid of Ceres. Before winning a dance contest with his buddy Blueberry Pirate -- who is renowned for smuggling fresh fruit -- Curtis learns from Blueberry about a scheme to give a fetal &quot;real live girl&quot; to the similarly male-dominated planet of Jupiter in exchange for a strapping adolescent known solely as &quot;The Boy Who Actually Saw a Female Breast.&quot; He in turn will be sent to the all-female planet of Venus where he will spend his life servicing the planet's occupants. Unfortunately, Curtis is followed by the mysterious self-proclaimed birthday boy Professor Hess, who has a tendency to vaporize any and all who come into contact with him. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival as a part of the Midnight Madness program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8ede70355fbe93f3d41fc438b8b9fc3477f4b6","amp;dn":"The+American+Astronaut+%282001%29+DVDrip-XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8ede70355fbe93f3d41fc438b8b9fc3477f4b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,142,222,112,53,95,190,147,243,212,31,196,56,184,185,252,52,119,244,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
