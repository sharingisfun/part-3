The version which is floating around the internet is generally v1.10, which is older and buggier, so I decided to upload the latest version (v1.6) for you pirates.\n\nFor those who want to study the KLN 90A in more detail, I have included the real world manuals from Bendix-King. These manuals were up-to-date at the time I uploaded this package here.\n\nFor those who are tired of BN-2's blue panel and want to try something different, I have included the latest version of Frank Safranek's alternative panels for BN-2 Islander. Refer to their Readme files for more info.\n\nUnfortunately, this aircraft has an annoying clicking sound bug. This problem occurs due to a faulty wind sound file which comes with the original installer. To solve it, I prepared a &quot;fix&quot; for you and included it in the package. Do NOT forget to apply it after the installation is complete.\n\nSeed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79854aaefe7d0f203ec8d5b1691b5b6db211723e","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Flight1+BN-2+Islander+v1.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79854aaefe7d0f203ec8d5b1691b5b6db211723e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,133,74,174,254,125,15,32,62,200,213,177,105,27,91,109,178,17,114,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
