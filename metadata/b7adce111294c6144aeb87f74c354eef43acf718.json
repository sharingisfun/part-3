Billions of interconnected devices will be monitoring the environment, transportation systems, factories, farms, forests, utilities, soil and weather conditions, oceans and resources.\n\nMany of these sensors and actuators will be networked into autonomous sets, with much of the information being exchanged machine-to-machine directly and without human involvement. Machine-to-machine communications are typically terse. Most sensors and actuators will report or act upon small pieces of information - &quot;chirps&quot;. Burdening these devices with current network protocol stacks is inefficient, unnecessary and unduly increases their cost of ownership.\n\nThis must change. The architecture of the\nInternet of Things must evolve now by\nincorporating simpler protocols toward at the edges of the\nnetwork, or remain forever inefficient. Rethinking the Internet of Things describes reasons why we must rethink current approaches to the Internet of Things. Appropriate architectures that will coexist with existing networking protocols are described in detail. An architecture comprised of integrator functions, propagator nodes, and end devices, along with their interactions, is explored.\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\n    Discusses the difference between the &quot;normal&quot; Internet and the Internet of Things.\n    Describes a new architecture and its components in the &quot;chirp&quot; context.\n    Explains the shortcomings of IP for IoT.\n    Describes the anatomy of the IoT.\n    Describes how to build a suitable network to maximize\n    the amazing potential of the IoT.\n\nWho this book is for\n\n\nThought\nleaders, executives, architectural, standards and development leaders in\nthe evolving IoT industry. Corporations and organizations whose\ncommercial products could be adapted simply to be functioning devices on the\nIOT while saving billions of dollars in unnecessary costs or proprietary\ndesigns. Those who wish to capitalize on technology change and those\ninterested in the Internet, its capabilities and the need to improve it.\n\nPage Numbers Source ISBN: 1430257407\nPublisher: Apress; 1 edition (December 29, 2013)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00EBCGHSW","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7adce111294c6144aeb87f74c354eef43acf718","amp;dn":"%5BFrancis+daCosta%5DRethinking+the+Internet+of+Things+A+Scalable+Ap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7adce111294c6144aeb87f74c354eef43acf718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,173,206,17,18,148,198,20,74,235,135,247,76,53,78,239,67,172,247,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
