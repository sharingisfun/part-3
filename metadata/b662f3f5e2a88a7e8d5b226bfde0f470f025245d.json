Updates to nearly every chapter keep this book at the forefront of developments in modern power systems, reflecting international standards, practices, and technologies.\n\nTopics covered include:\n-    Electric power generation: nonconventional methods\n-    Electric power generation: conventional methods\n-    Transmission system\n-    Distribution systems\n-    Electric power utilization\n-    Power quality\n\nL.L. Grigsby, a respected and accomplished authority in power engineering, and section editors Saifur Rahman, Rama Ramakumar, George Karady, Bill Kersting, Andrew Hanson, and Mark Halpin present substantially new and revised material, giving readers up-to-date information on core areas. These include advanced energy technologies, distributed utilities, load characterization and modeling, and power quality issues such as power system harmonics, voltage sags, and power quality monitoring.\n\nWith six new and 16 fully revised chapters, the book supplies a high level of detail and, more importantly, a tutorial style of writing and use of photographs and graphics to help the reader understand the material.\n\nNew chapters cover:\n-    Water\n-    Transmission Line Reliability Methods\n-    High Voltage Direct Current Transmission System\n-    Advanced Technology High-Temperature Conduction\n-    Distribution Short-Circuit Protection\n-    Linear Electric Motors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b662f3f5e2a88a7e8d5b226bfde0f470f025245d","amp;dn":"Electric+Power+Generation%2C+Transmission%2C+and+Distribution+%283rd+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b662f3f5e2a88a7e8d5b226bfde0f470f025245d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,98,243,245,226,168,138,126,141,91,34,107,253,224,244,112,240,37,36,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
