Described as a cross between Metallica and Alice in Chains, the group spent several years playing the Iowa bar circuit before the two men joined Slipknot. Stone Sour re-formed in the early 2000s, though, and quickly distinguished themselves with a pair of gold-selling albums and three Grammy nominations.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Orchids\n02.Take A Number\n03.Bother\n04.Through Glass\n05.Choose\n06.Come What(ever) May\n07.Sillyworld\n08.Say You'll Haunt Me\n09.Threadbare\n10.Nylon 6/6\n11.Inhale\n12.Get Inside\n13.Road Hogs\n14.Kill Everybody\n15.Tumult\n16.Digital (Did You Tell)\n17.Pieces\n18.Your God\n19.Home Again\n20.30/30-150\n21.The Bitter End\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
