By providing mechanics before functional anatomy, the book helps students understand forces and their effects before studying how body structures deal with forces. Students will learn to appreciate the consequences of external forces, how the body generates internal forces to maintain position, and how forces create movement in physical activities.\nRather than presenting the principles as isolated and abstract, the text enables students to discover the principles of biomechanics for themselves through observation. By examining ordinary activities firsthand, students will develop meaningful explanations resulting in a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanical concepts. This practical approach combines striking visual elements with clear and concise language to encourage active learning and improved comprehension.\n\nThis updated edition maintains the organization and features that made previous editions user friendly, such as a quick reference guide of frequently used equations printed on the inside cover and review questions at the end of each chapter to test studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ understanding of important concepts. The third edition also incorporates new features to facilitate learning:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Access to MaxTRAQ Educational 2D software allows students to analyze real-world sport movements through video.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The new web resource guides students step by step through the process of solving 10 sample problems.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New art and diagrams enhance problem sets and help students visualize the mechanics of real-world scenarios.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Increased number of review questions (200) and problem sets (120) provide an opportunity for practical application of concepts.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Greater emphasis on the basics, including improved descriptions of conversions and an expanded explanation of the assumption of point mass when modeling objects, provides a stronger foundation for understanding.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New content on deriving kinematic data from video or film and the use of accelerometers in monitoring physical activity keeps students informed of technological advances in the field.\n\nInstructors will benefit from an updated ancillary package. An instructor guide outlines each chapter and offers step-by-step solutions to the quantitative problems presented, as well as sample lecture topics, student activities, and teaching tips. A test package makes it easy to prepare quizzes and tests, and an image bank contains most of the figures and tables from the text for use in developing course presentations.\nBiomechanics of Sport and Exercise, Third Edition, is ideal for those needing a deeper understanding of biomechanics from a qualitative perspective. Thoroughly updated and expanded, this text makes the biomechanics of physical activity easy to understand and apply. .\n\nAbout the Author\nPeter M. McGinnis, PhD, is a professor in the department of kinesiology at the State University of New York, College at Cortland, where he has taught since 1990. He is also the menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pole vault coach at SUNY Cortland. Before 1990, Dr. McGinnis was an assistant professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Northern Colorado. During that time he served as a sport biomechanist in the Sports Science Division of the U.S. Olympic Committee in Colorado Springs, where he conducted applied sport biomechanics research, tested athletes, taught biomechanics courses to coaches, and developed educational materials for coaches.\nDr. McGinnis is also the biomechanist for the pole vault event for USA Track and Field. As a member of the American Society of Testing Materials, he serves as chair of the pole vault equipment subcommittee and the task group on pole vault helmets. He has authored numerous articles and technical reports about the biomechanics of pole vaulting and has been a reviewer for Sports Biomechanics, the Journal of Applied Biomechanics, Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport, and the Journal of Sports Sciences.\nDr. McGinnis is a member of numerous professional organizations, including the American College of Sports Medicine, American Society of Biomechanics, and the International Society of Biomechanics in Sport. He received a PhD in physical education from the University of Illinois in 1984 and a BS in engineering from Swarthmore College in 1976.
