It is a false possitive (it happens with almost all the trainers), but you can safely delete it if you don't trust me (but better if you do it when the installation is over instead of during the installation process).\n\n\n\n============================================================================\nInstructions:                                                              =\n============================================================================\n\n1. Mount, burn or just unzip the .iso file.\n2. Run &quot;Setup.exe&quot; to install the game.\n3. Use the shortcuts the installer creates to play.\n\n\n\n============================================================================\nFAQ:                                                                       =\n============================================================================\n\n Q: Does the multiplayer (co-op) work?\n A: Yes, either using Steam, or using programs like Tunngle, Garena or Hamachi (LAN).\n\n Q: Do I need Steam to play?\n A: No.\n\n Q: But can I use Steam to play?\n A: Yes. \n\n Q: What skins are included?\n A: All of them until today. \n\n Q: What DLCs are included?\n A: All of them until today.\n\n Q: There are several Borderlands 2 torrents. Why to get this one?\n A: Because you get the game with eveything that has been published until today just in one torrent, because you don't have to worry to download additional files, like cracks, which are also included (so just download, install and play), because you can combine English/Spanish audio with English/Spanish text, so you can play, for example, with English voices but Spanish texts, because it works online and you can choose to use Steam or not, because a saved game with a level 61 character with awesome ÃƒÂ­tems and a savegame editor are included, etc.\n\n\n\nNotice this is not an update but the full game. Do not install it over an existing installation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69dccb0ad6adb18ff1b38195c4802be5591608a7","amp;dn":"Borderlands+2+GOTY+v1.8.2+%2B+DLCs+%28Eng%2FSpa%29+%28online%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69dccb0ad6adb18ff1b38195c4802be5591608a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,220,203,10,214,173,177,143,241,179,129,149,196,128,43,229,89,22,8,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
