SpyHunter is automatically configured to give you optimal protection with limited interaction, so all you need to do is install it for immediate and ongoing protection.\n\nAs malware continues to evolve and become more sophisticated to avoid detection by anti-spyware/anti-virus programs, SpyHunter responds with advanced technology to stay one step ahead of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s malware threats. SpyHunter offers additional customization capabilities to ensure every user is able to custom tailor SpyHunter to fit their specific needs.\n\nSpyHunter has the ability to detect and remove rootkits, which are used to stealth install rogue anti-spyware programs and other trojans.\n\nRootkits use hidden and encrypted files and folders to avoid detection by traditional security software. SpyHunterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s newly integrated advanced rootkit detection technology allows it to perform an instant rootkit scan and promptly display a message upon detection. SpyHunter will then ask the user to reboot the computer and will remove the rootkit during the reboot process.\n\nIn order to remove rootkits completely, Windows must be stopped upon boot because rootkits utilize other files that load and run with Windows. Therefore, to prevent rootkits from regenerating on a userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s computer, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve added a Compact OS into SpyHunter that allows your system to be booted without Windows so that the rootkit may be removed from your computer.\n\nIf SpyHunter is not able to automatically remove a malware object, the Spyware HelpDesk, an interactive feature integrated into SpyHunter, allows our technicians to remotely analyze your machine and directly deliver a custom fix to specific malware problems that may be unique to your computer.\n\nKey Features\n* SpyHunter Scanner\nSpyHunter has been carefully engineered to be powerful and complete enough for the most demanding technical professional, yet simple enough for a first-time computer user to utilize safely and effectively.
