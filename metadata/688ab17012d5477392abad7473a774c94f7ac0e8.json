Dead and Buried focuses on Dan Gillis (James Farentino)\na man who has recently returned to his hometown of Potter's Bluff to be its\nsheriff. His job becomes difficult when a series of strangers who visit\nPotter's Bluff begin dying in violent and mysterious ways. To make matters\nworse, his wife, Janet (Melody Anderson), has begun to act strangely,\ntaking an odd interest in voodoo and acting like she might be having an\naffair. As the murder victims pile up, Gillis discovers that all his\ntroubles have an occult origin that has to do with the town's elderly\nmortician, Dobbs (Jack Albertson, in his final feature film role). Gillis\ngets to the bottom of the mystery, only to discover that the truth is much\nworse than he imagined. Despite effective direction and solid acting, Dead\nand Buried got lost in the shuffle of the early '80s horror boom and\nfailed to click with the movie-going public. However, it later gained an\naudience via home video and cable and remains a minor cult favorite today\nthanks to its singular blend of creepy atmosphere and gruesome shocks.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-James Farentino.\n=&gt;-Melody Anderson.\n=&gt;-Jack Albertson.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Gary Sherman.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Horror : Mystery : Drama.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1981.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.32 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 006 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 33mn.\n=&gt;-Dead And Buried............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dead_and_buried/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 720.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1889 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 218 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688ab17012d5477392abad7473a774c94f7ac0e8","amp;dn":"Dead+And+Buried+-+Horror+1981+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688ab17012d5477392abad7473a774c94f7ac0e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,138,177,112,18,213,71,115,146,171,173,116,115,167,116,201,79,122,192,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
