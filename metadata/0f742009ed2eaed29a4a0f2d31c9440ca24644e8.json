Now Main thing i want you to read is Audio work.\n\nwell i was searching for good audio of this movie for quiet sometime but had no luck earlier cam audios were ok but not so good in certain parts of movie specially Robot speaking among others. today i found 2 audios on net. 1 was ok in action scenes and other during vocals so i join both of them and in order to get one ok audio. it took my lot of time but all went smooth. i try to kill echo and normalized audio as well. since both are CAM audios keep in mind. you wont notice when audio change every part has been normalized and smooth. its like 1 complete audio Well my friends told me those who watched in cinema that robot, gangsters speaking parts are bit hard to understand due to their accent. Director of this movie has done the same with District 9 Anyways this is by far best Yet. unless something poped up later which i dont think anytime soon.\n\nP/S: if you have good/bad audios or you know how to get one please come forward and contact me.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/226/utd9o7Rz.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/226/utd9o7Rz.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/75/KFokK8x0.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/75/KFokK8x0.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/226/8KFfXSSJ.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/226/8KFfXSSJ.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/1569/Mrt0SZIC.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/1569/Mrt0SZIC.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f742009ed2eaed29a4a0f2d31c9440ca24644e8","amp;dn":"Chappie+2015+HDCAM+New+AUDIO+x264-CPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f742009ed2eaed29a4a0f2d31c9440ca24644e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,116,32,9,237,46,174,210,154,74,15,45,49,201,68,12,162,70,68,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
