The book is divided into three sections. Section A consists of introduction, Section B comprises the synthesis and characterization techniques, and Section C is dedicated to the applications of MOFs. The book would be useful for scientists and researchers interested in the field of MOFs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b208fdb2b9e531ca0b2118a178e95d05a7d0a1e","amp;dn":"Metal-Organic+Frameworks+-+Fahmina+Zafar%2C+Eram+Sharmin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b208fdb2b9e531ca0b2118a178e95d05a7d0a1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,32,143,219,43,158,83,28,160,178,17,138,23,142,149,208,90,125,10,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
