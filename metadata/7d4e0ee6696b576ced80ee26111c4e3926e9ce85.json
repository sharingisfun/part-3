It was the seventh studio album released after his death and the third to be produced by Alan Douglas. The album contains five jam sessions. The raw material was recorded 1969 in NYC, featuring Buddy Miles, Billy Cox, Mitch Mitchell and Larry Young (among others). It was released on vinyl in 1980 by Polydor (UK) and Reprise (USA). The album itself was never re-released officially, neither on LP nor on CD. What you find here is a vinyl rip of the original US release plus two different unofficial CD releases, following more or less the Douglas release. Some of the tracks you can also find on Dagger Records' 'Hear My Music' and on the official Sony/Hendrix-Family releases 'West Coast Seattle Boy' and 'People, Hell and Angels'. max\n\n\nJimi Hendrix - Nine To The Universe\nLabel: Reprise Records - HS 2299\nFormat: Vinyl, LP, Album\nCountry: US\nReleased: 1980\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Blues Rock, Psychedelic Rock\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1 \tNine To The Universe \t8:45\nA2 \tJimi / Jimmy Jam \t8:04\nB1 \tYoung / Hendrix \t10:32\nB2 \tEasy Blues \t4:30\nB3 \tDrone Blues \t6:16\n\n\nJimi Hendrix - Message From Nine To The Universe\nLabel: Reclamation - RECD 1012\nFormat: CD, Unofficial Release\nCountry: UK\nReleased: 2006\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Psychedelic Rock, Classic Rock\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 \tNine To The Universe \t8:48\n2 \tJimi / Jimmy Jam \t8:01\n3 \tYoung / Hendrix Jam \t10:26\n4 \tEasy Blues \t4:17\n5 \tDrone Blues \t6:18\n6 \tMidnight Lightning Jam \t11:58\n7 \tHighway Of Broken Dreams \t14:16\n8 \tLonely Avenue Jam \t2:48\n9 \tLover Man \t4:13\n10 \tTring To Be \t7:15\n\n\nJimi Hendrix - Message From 9 To The Universe Volume 1\nATM 055\nLabel: none\nFormat: CD, Unofficial Release\nCountry: ?\nReleased: ?\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Psychedelic Rock, Classic Rock\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 \tMessage from Nine To The Universe \t18:49\n2 \tJimi / Jimmy Jam \t16:16\n3 \tYoung / Hendrix Jam \t14:28\n4 \tEasy Blues \t4:17\n5 \tDrone Blues \t8:36","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d4e0ee6696b576ced80ee26111c4e3926e9ce85","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+%28Message+from%29+Nine+To+The+Universe+%283+different+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d4e0ee6696b576ced80ee26111c4e3926e9ce85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,78,14,230,105,107,87,108,237,128,238,38,17,28,78,57,38,233,206,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
