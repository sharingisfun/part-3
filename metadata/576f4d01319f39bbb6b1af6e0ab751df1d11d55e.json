By the end of the 80s, however, the band -- whose music was instantly recognizable from Mark King's thumb-slap bass technique and associate member Wally Badarou's synthesizer flourishes -- had crossed over to the point where they were often classified as sophisti-pop and dance-rock, equally likely to be placed in the context of Sade and the Style Council as any group that made polished, upbeat, danceable pop/rock. The band's commercial peak came with 1985's World Machine, but they continued to record and tour sporadically throughout the 90s and 2000's.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Lessons In Love\n02.Running In The Family\n03.To Be With You Again\n04.Leaving Me Now\n05.Starchild\n06.Standing In The Light\n07.Micro-Kid\n08.Physical Presence\n09.Hot Water\n10.The Chant Has Begun\n11.Dune Tune\n12.Almost There\n13.Two Hearts Collide\n14.Take Care Of Yourself\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Heaven In My Hands\n02.Love Games\n03.Children Say\n04.It's Over\n05.Something About You\n06.I Don't Know Why\n07.Are You Hearing (What I Hear)\n08.Take A Look\n09.Heathrow\n10.Turn It On\n11.The Chinese Way\n12.Love Meeting Love\n13.The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)\n14.Tracie\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:576f4d01319f39bbb6b1af6e0ab751df1d11d55e","amp;dn":"Level+42+-+Greatest+Hits++And+More+%281998%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"576f4d01319f39bbb6b1af6e0ab751df1d11d55e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,111,77,1,49,159,57,187,182,177,175,110,10,183,81,223,29,17,213,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
