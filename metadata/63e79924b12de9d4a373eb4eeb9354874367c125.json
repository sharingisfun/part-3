In fact, a couple of '70s groups\nhave direct ties to Imagination; Leee John and Ashley Ingram spent time\nduring that decade playing supportive roles in the Delfonics and Chairmen\nof the Board, prior to Imagination's formation. Along with drummer Errol Kennedy,\nvocalist John and bassist Ingram formed the group in 1981. By the end of that year,\nthey already had their first album released and a minor hit in the form of that album's\ntitle track, &quot;Body Talk.&quot; The group's second album, 1982's In the Heat of the Night,\nwas their most successful, spawning a trio of U.S. R&amp;B chart hits in the form of\n&quot;Just an Illusion&quot; (number 27), &quot;Music and Lights&quot; (number 52), and &quot;Changes&quot;\n(number 46). Those singles were even more popular in their home country,\nwith the first pair reaching the Top Five.\n\nThe remix collection Night Dubbing appeared the following year, as did the group's\nthird proper album, Scandalous. The group's success fizzled until their mid-'90s\nbreakup (at the time, Leee John was the only remaining original member), though\n1984's &quot;This Means War&quot; was able to put a dent in the U.S. R&amp;B chart. John remained\nactive in the entertainment industry, hosting U.K. television programs and continuing\nhis recording career as a solo artist and collaborator. Since the group's split, several\ncompilations have been released;\n\nMusic Club's The Very Best of Imagination is the best place to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbum Review (c/o Allmusic)\n\nhis Very Best of Imagination, released in 2000 by the U.K.'s Music Club,\nis the best introduction to the clubby R&amp;B group's work. Not to be confused\nwith the 1998 release of the same title from BR, which is two-thirds the same\nselection-wise, this holds a slight edge over the several other Imagination\nanthologies with a smarter crop of inclusions. Like most of the other Imagination\nanthologies, this one concentrates on material from the group's first three albums,\nwhen they were at their peak both artistically and commercially. There are no glaring\nomissions, and all seven minutes of &quot;So Good, So Right&quot; are rightfully included,\nso this one gets the nod.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nImagination - The Very Best of Imagination\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArtist.............................: Imagination\nAlbum:..............The Very Best of Imagination\nGenre.......................: Disco / R&amp;B / Funk\nSource......................................: CD\nYear......................................: 2000\n\nRipper: Exact Audio Copy V1.0 b1 &amp; HP DVD RW AD-7701H\n\nCodec...............................: LAME 3.98\nVersion......................: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality.......: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels....................: Stereo / 44100 HZ\nTags...........: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3, APE v2,000\n\nInformation..: 2000 Music Club &quot;Very Best Of&quot; Compilation\n\nRipped by..............: BSW on 7/23/2011\nPosted by..............: BSW on 7/23/2011\nNews Server...........: news.astraweb.com\n\nNews Group(s).: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded......: NFO, SFV, M3U, LOG\nCovers.....................: Front\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1.
