The duo's breakthrough came about with the discovery of Donna Summer, who was one of the backing singers they used for recording sessions. Liking her voice and striking appearance, they recorded two singles, &quot;The Hostage&quot; and &quot;Lady Of The Night&quot;. Two albums followed: Lady Of The Night in 1974 and Love To Love You Baby in 1975. The latter's 17-minute epic title track was a groundbreaking recording, technologically ahead of its time and aimed squarely at the thriving disco scene. &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot; was a pulsating, sensual single (compared by some to Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg's version of &quot;Je T'Aime ... Moi Non Plus&quot;), distinctive for Summer's sexual sighs and groans that punctuated the final stages of the record. It was a worldwide hit, as well as a controversial one, and a phenomenon on the disco scene, typified by New York's thriving clubs, such as The Gallery, The Paradise Garage and Studio 54. Moroder continued to produce other artists and Summer's subsequent albums. Summer's &quot;I Feel Love&quot; (taken from I Remember Yesterday) continued where &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot; left off and was an electronic production masterpiece, especially considering the technology available at the time. It was another apex in disco's history and confirmed Summer's unintentional rise to the role of disco prima donna.&quot;\n\n\nIMDB.com Donna Summer biography:\n\n&quot;Donna Summer was the Queen of Disco in the 1970s with a pop/dance/rock sound that was a hybrid of American soul and European synthesizer based music. Summer's musical career was launched on stage in Munich, Germany, in productions of Hair and Porgy &amp; Bess. In Germany, she hooked up with producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, and delivered the orgasmic &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; which brought her worldwide fame. Summer was the first female artist to garner back-to-back multi-platinum double albums and the first female artist to incorporate synthesizers as well as the first artist to create an extended play song. Musically, she diversified into pop and rock, while career-wise, she appeared in the disco movie Thank God It's Friday (1978), for which the song, &quot;Last Dance&quot; won a Best Song Oscar, as well as numerous American TV music specials. Her career reached its zenith in 1980 with the release of the critically-acclaimed record &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, a diverse fusion of rock and dance which is still considered to be the forerunner of such range of artists as Billy Idol, Whitney Houston and Alanis Morissette.&quot;\n\n\nAllmusic.com Donna Summer biography:\n\n&quot;Donna Summer's title as the &quot;Queen of Disco&quot; wasn't mere hype ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she was one of the very few disco performers to enjoy a measure of career longevity, and her consistent chart success was rivaled in the disco world only by the Bee Gees. Summer was certainly a talented vocalist, trained as a powerful gospel belter, but then again, so were many of her contemporaries. Of major importance in setting Summer apart were her songwriting abilities and her choice of talented collaborators in producers/songwriters Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, which resulted in a steady supply of high-quality (and, often, high-concept) material. But what was more, few vocalists could match the sultry, unfettered eroticism Summer brought to many of her best recordings, which seemed to embody the spirit of the disco era perfectly. The total package made Summer the ultimate disco diva, one of the few whose star power was even bigger than the music.\n\nSummer was born LaDonna Andre Gaines on December 31, 1948, and grew up in Boston's Mission Hill section. Part of a religious family, she first sang in her church's gospel choir, and as a teenager performed with a rock group called the Crow. After high school, she moved to New York to sing and act in stage productions, and soon landed a role in a German production of Hair. She moved to Europe around 1968-1969, and spent a year in the German cast, after which she became part of the Hair company in Vienna. She joined the Viennese Folk Opera, and later returned to Germany, where she settled in Munich and met and married Helmut Sommer, adopting an Anglicized version of his last name. Summer performed in various stage musicals and worked as a studio vocalist in Munich, recording demos and background vocals. Her first solo recording was 1971's &quot;Sally Go 'Round the Roses,&quot; but success would not come until 1974, when she met producers/songwriters Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte while working on a Three Dog Night record. The three teamed up for the single &quot;The Hostage,&quot; which became a hit around Western Europe, and Summer released her first album, Lady of the Night, in Europe only. In 1975, the trio recorded &quot;Love to Love You Baby,&quot; a disco-fied reimagining of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin's lush, heavy-breathing opus &quot;Je T'aime...Moi Non Plus.&quot; Powered by Summer's graphic moans, &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; became a massive hit in Europe, and drew the attention of Casablanca Records, which put the track out in America. It climbed to number two on the singles charts, and became a dance-club sensation when Moroder remixed the track into a 17-minute, side-long epic on the LP of the same name.\n\nIn the wake of &quot;Love to Love You Baby,&quot; albums (as opposed to just singles) became an important forum for Summer and her producers. The 1976 follow-up Love Trilogy contained another side-long suite in &quot;Try Me (I Know We Can Make It Work),&quot; and demonstrated Moroder and Bellotte's growing sophistication as arrangers with its lush, sweeping strings. Four Seasons of Love, released later in the year, was a concept album with one track dedicated to each season, and 1977's I Remember Yesterday featured a variety of genre exercises. Despite the album's title, it produced the most forward-looking single in Summer and Moroder's catalog, the monumental &quot;I Feel Love.&quot; Eschewing the strings and typical disco excess, &quot;I Feel Love&quot; was the first major pop hit recorded with an entirely synthesized backing track; its lean, sleek arrangement and driving, hypnotic pulse laid the groundwork not only for countless Euro-dance imitators, but also for the techno revolution of the '80s and '90s. It became Summer's second Top Ten hit in the U.S., and she followed it with Once Upon a Time, another concept album, this one retelling the story of Cinderella for the disco era.\n\nSummer's albums were selling well, bolstered by her popularity in the dance clubs, and she was poised to become a major pop hitmaker as well. Her acting turn in the 1978 disco-themed comedy Thank God It's Friday produced another hit in &quot;Last Dance,&quot; which won her a Grammy for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal (as well as an Oscar for songwriter Paul Jabara). Doubtlessly benefiting from the added exposure, the double-LP set Live and More became Summer's first number one album later that year. It featured one side of new studio material, including a disco cover of the psychedelic pop epic &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; that became her first number one pop single early the next year. Her 1979 double-LP Bad Girls featured more of her songwriting contributions than ever, and went straight to number one, as did the lusty singles &quot;Bad Girls&quot; and the rock-oriented &quot;Hot Stuff,&quot; which made Summer the first female artist ever to score three number one singles in the same calendar year. Her greatest-hits package On the Radio also topped the charts, the first time any artist had ever hit number one with three consecutive double LPs; the newly recorded title track became another hit, and Summer's duet with Barbra Streisand, &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),&quot; became her fourth number one single.\n\nAt the peak of her success, Summer decided to leave Casablanca, and became the first artist signed to the new Geffen label. Sensing that the disco era was coming to a close, Summer attempted to modify her style to include more R&amp;B and pop/rock on her first Geffen album, 1980's The Wanderer; the album and its title track were both hits. Not wanting to alienate her core audience, Summer returned to pure dance music on an attempted follow-up; however, Geffen deemed I'm a Rainbow not worthy of release  - it was finally issued in 1996. Summer ended her collaboration with prodcers Moroder and Bellotte but in 1992 she reunited with Moroder for the non-LP single &quot;Carry On,&quot; which won the inaugural Grammy for Best Dance Recording in 1998.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\nLady of the Night (1974)\n========================\n01.
