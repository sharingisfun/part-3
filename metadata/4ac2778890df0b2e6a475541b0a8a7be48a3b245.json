Ching, &quot;Architecture: Form, Space, and Order&quot;\n\nISBN: 0471752169 \n\nFor more than thirty years, the beautifully illustrated Architecture: Form, Space, and Order has been the classic introduction to the basic vocabulary of architectural design. The updated Third Edition features expanded sections on circulation, light, views, and site context, along with new considerations of environmental factors, building codes, and contemporary examples of form, space, and order.\n\nThis classic visual reference helps both students and practicing architects understand the basic vocabulary of architectural design by examining how form and space are ordered in the built environment.? Using his trademark meticulous drawing, Professor Ching shows the relationship between fundamental elements of architecture through the ages and across cultural boundaries. By looking at these seminal ideas, Architecture: Form, Space, and Order encourages the reader to look critically at the built environment and promotes a more evocative understanding of architecture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac2778890df0b2e6a475541b0a8a7be48a3b245","amp;dn":"Architecture%3A+Form%2C+Space%2C+and+Order","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac2778890df0b2e6a475541b0a8a7be48a3b245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,194,119,136,144,223,11,46,106,71,85,65,176,168,167,190,72,163,178,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
