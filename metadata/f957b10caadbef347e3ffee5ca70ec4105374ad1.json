Well i was the same, until I got majorly pissed that the only way i could watch it at will was to either buy the DVD, watch it subbed, or watch it online at a rate of 3 fps &gt;:(. So what i did was find what seemed to be the only good copy on the internet, streamed it, and then went through the painstaking task of finding a program that could extract it from the temps (I used VideoCacheView by the way). So seriously guys, PLEASE SEED BECAUSE IT WAS A LOT MORE TROUBLE THAN IT SOUNDS!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f957b10caadbef347e3ffee5ca70ec4105374ad1","amp;dn":"Death+Note+Movie+Trilogy+English+Dub+%28Kevin+Wood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f957b10caadbef347e3ffee5ca70ec4105374ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,87,177,12,170,219,239,52,126,63,254,229,202,112,236,65,5,55,74,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
