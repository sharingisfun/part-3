Indeed, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get to know some immediately-useful VMM 2012 tricks in building service templates. But youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also come to understand how Operations Manager handles monitoring, Service Manager and App Controller facilitate self-service, and Orchestrator glues everything together. \n\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re here to pass that 70-246 and get your MCSE: Private Cloud, or just looking to expand your knowledge, this course isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one to miss. \n\nRelated Area of Expertise:\nMicrosoft System Center\n\nPrivate Cloud isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so much a technology as a way of thinking. A Private Cloud in operations might look like a virtual environment. It has all of the same actions, buttons, and management tools. But it is the way in which you operate that virtual environment that evolves it into something special, and something far more useful for your datacenter. \n\nThis certification tests not only your virtual skills; it also requires a mile-wide-and-inch-deep understanding of the entirety of System Center: Operations Manager, Virtual Machine Manager, Orchestrator, Service Manager, App Controller, and Data Protection Manager. \n\nGreg approaches this course as the second of MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two exams, with the 70-247 being your first in line. By starting with the 70-247, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the technology underpinnings for a Private Cloud firmly constructed. Greg continues that story in this course by helping you actually use the environment you just created. \n\nBut he goes further here than ever before, delivering real-world examples that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want to implement immediately. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll leave with a better understanding of how a System Center Private Cloud will greatly enhance IT services like IIS, SQL, and even Remote Desktop Services.\n\n\nFor more Visit : http://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training-videos/course/microsoft-system-center-70-246","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1bf1be19925bd1c87bc6eb2cedefba2f47266a","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+-+Monitoring.%26amp%3B.Operating.Private.Cloud.with.Syst","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1bf1be19925bd1c87bc6eb2cedefba2f47266a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,27,241,190,25,146,91,209,200,123,198,235,44,237,239,186,47,71,38,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
