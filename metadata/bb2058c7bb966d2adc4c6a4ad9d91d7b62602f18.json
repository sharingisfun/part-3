Scout Finch, daughter of the town lawyer, likes to spend her summers building treehouses, swimming, and catching lightning bugs with her big brother Jem. But one summer, when a black man is accused of raping a white woman, ScoutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s carefree days come to an end. In the county courtroom, she will join her father in a desperate battle against ignorance and prejudice. When it first appeared in 1960, this extraordinary novel became an instant best-seller, winning a Pulitzer Prize and triumphant critical success. Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill a Mockingbird explores the deepest roots of human behaviorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple story. \nToday, it is universally hailed as a masterpiece of American literature.\n\nAwards:\n - Audie Award Winner\n - National Book Award Finalist (Fiction)\n - Pulitzer Prize Winner","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb2058c7bb966d2adc4c6a4ad9d91d7b62602f18","amp;dn":"TO+KILL+A+MOCKINGBIRD+-+Harper+Lee+Read+Sissy+Spacek+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb2058c7bb966d2adc4c6a4ad9d91d7b62602f18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,32,88,199,187,150,109,42,220,76,106,74,217,217,29,123,98,96,47,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
