AUGUSTINE (354-430), bishop of Hippo, was an early Christian theologian and philosopher whose writings were very influential in the development of western Christianity and western philosophy.\n\nAugustine was one of the main figures through and by whom the widespread merging of the Greek philosophical tradition and the Judeo-Christian religious and scriptural traditions was accomplished.  He was one of the towering figures of medieval philosophy whose authority and thought came to exert a pervasive and enduring influence well into the modern period, and even up to the present day, especially among those sympathetic to the religious tradition which he helped to shape.  But even for those who do not share this sympathy, there is much in Augustine's thought that is worthy of serious philosophical attention.  Augustine was not only one of the major sources whereby classical philosophy in general and Neoplatonism in particular enter into the mainstream of early and subsequent medieval philosophy, but there are significant contributions of his own that emerge from his modification of that Greco-Roman inheritance, e.g., his subtle accounts of belief and authority, his account of knowledge and illumination, his emphasis upon the importance and centrality of the will, and his focus upon a new way of conceptualizing the phenomena of human history.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format, of varying quality, unless otherwise noted:\n\n* THE CITY OF GOD (Penguin Classics, 1984).
