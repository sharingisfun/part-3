King, Leslie S. Klinger (Editors)\r\nEnglish | 2016 | Mystery &amp; Thriller | 12.5 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this follow-up to the acclaimed In the Company of Sherlock Holmes, expert Sherlockians Laurie King and Les Klinger put forth the question: What happens when great writers/creators who are not known as Sherlock Holmes devotees admit to being inspired by Conan Doyle stories? While some are highly-regarded mystery writers, others are best known for their work in the fields of fantasy or science fiction. All of these talented authors, however, share a great admiration for Arthur Conan Doyle and his greatest creations, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.\r\nTo the editorsâ€™ great delight, these stories go in many directions. Some explore the spirit of Holmes himself; others tell of detectives themselves inspired by Holmesâ€™s adventures or methods. A young boy becomes a detective; a young woman sharpens her investigative skills; an aging actress and a housemaid each find that they have unexpected talents. Other characters from the Holmes stories are explored, and even non-Holmesian tales by Conan Doyle are echoed. The variations are endless!\r\nAlthough not a formal collection of new Sherlock Holmes storiesâ€”however some do fit that moldâ€”instead these writers were asked to be inspired by the Conan Doyle canon. The results are breathtaking, for fans of Holmes and Watson as well as readers new to Doyleâ€™s writingâ€”indeed, for all readers who love exceptional storytelling.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7124285c17463cb4cf91f1c6726941bd36a33c","amp;dn":"Echoes+of+Sherlock+Holmes+-+Laurie+R.+King-Leslie+S.+Klinger+%5BEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7124285c17463cb4cf91f1c6726941bd36a33c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,113,36,40,92,23,70,60,180,207,145,241,198,114,105,65,189,54,163,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
