Filled with foreboding soundscapes, hypnotic rhythms and enigmatic lyrics, this is music that will resonate not only with fans of Lynch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s films, but also to listeners who appreciate daring, experimental music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:212b94fd2d171cfda3a300b0a2b497d2d355e3f0","amp;dn":"David+Lynch+-+Crazy+Clown+Time+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"212b94fd2d171cfda3a300b0a2b497d2d355e3f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,43,148,253,45,23,28,253,163,163,0,176,162,180,151,210,211,85,227,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
