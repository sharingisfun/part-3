When &quot;Get It On&quot; was leaked to several radio stations around the U.S., it generated considerable buzz due to the speculation of the &quot;mystery&quot; band. The Zeppelin comparisons were enough to bolster early sales and the record shipped gold as &quot;Get It On&quot; became a sizable AOR hit and the band took part in the Monsters of Rock tour with acts like Van Halen and the Scorpions. However, a heavy backlash soon followed and subsequent releases from their self-titled debut failed to make much impact on radio. Kingdom Come entered the studio to record a follow-up with producer Keith Olsen at the helm. The resulting In Your Face, released in 1989, did little to quell the Zeppelin comparisons or to reverse the act's decline in commercial clout. The ensuing tour saw Kingdom Come collapse and all the original members, save for Wolf, leave the band. Wolf would carry on, releasing Hands of Time under the Kingdom Come banner in 1990, but the album stiffed and, along with the emergence of grunge, sealed the act's fate in the U.S. Kingdom Come would continue to release new material throughout the '90s and into the new century, but it was mostly limited to issue in Wolf's native Germany. \n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.
