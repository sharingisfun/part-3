They focus on fragments posthumously published under the title THE WILL TO POWER, which Heidegger read as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, rather than on Nietzsche's published works.  The lectures thus form a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers and are central to Heidegger's thought.\n\nThey books appeared in English translation during the years 1979-1987, and were reproduced in two paperback volumes in 1991, with some errors corrected and a new Introduction added.  (It's maddening, however, that the publisher never saw fit to include an index.)  The four individual volumes and original publication data are as follows:\n\n* Volume 1: The Will to Power as Art (Harper &amp; Row, 1979).  Translated with Notes and Analysis by David Farrell Krell.\n\n* Volume 2: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same (Harper &amp; Row, 1984).  Translated with Notes and Analysis by David Farrell Krell.\n\n* Volume 3: The Will to Power as Knowledge and as Metaphysics (Harper &amp; Row, 1987).  Translated by Joan Stambaugh, David Farrell Krell and Frank A. Capuzzi; edited with Notes and Analysis by David Farrell Krell.\n\n* Volume 4: Nihilism (Harper &amp; Row, 1982).  Translated by Frank A. Capuzzi; edited with Notes and Analysis by David Farrell Krell.\n\n==================================\n\nFor a collection of works by Friedrich Nietzsche, see the following:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9386147/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9386147/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9427312/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9427312/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4561a445fd94f6c4670f725e25403a7ef5663704","amp;dn":"Martin+Heidegger+-+Lectures+on+Nietzsche+%284+vols.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4561a445fd94f6c4670f725e25403a7ef5663704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,97,164,69,253,148,246,196,103,15,114,94,37,64,58,126,245,102,55,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
