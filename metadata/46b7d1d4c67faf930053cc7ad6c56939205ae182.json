Her parents have arrived in town for a surprise visit, and if they see her dyed hair, tattoos, and piercings, they just might disown her. Even worse, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re expecting to meet a nice, wholesome boyfriend, not a guy named Mace who has a neck tattoo and plays in a band. All her lies are about to come crashing down around her, but then she meets Cade.\n\nCade moved to Philadelphia to act and to leave his problems behind in Texas. So far though, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kept the problems and had very little opportunity to take the stage. When Max approaches him in a coffee shop with a crazy request to pretend to be her boyfriend, he agrees to play the part. But when Cade plays the role a little too well, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re forced to keep the ruse going. And the more they fake the relationship, the more real it begins to feel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46b7d1d4c67faf930053cc7ad6c56939205ae182","amp;dn":"FAKING+IT+%28Losing+It+%232%29+-+Cora+Carmack+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46b7d1d4c67faf930053cc7ad6c56939205ae182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,183,209,212,198,127,175,147,0,83,204,122,214,197,105,57,32,90,225,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
