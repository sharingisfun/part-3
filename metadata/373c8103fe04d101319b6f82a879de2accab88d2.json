NarutoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peers are praised by their families while Naruto wallows in loneliness. That night, Sakura Haruno takes Naruto out to the park to complain about her parents. They are confronted by Tobi who tracked Naruto down when the Akatsuki planted a seal on him. Tobi then uses the technique Gentei Tsukuyomi (Ã©â„¢ï¿½Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¨ÂªÂ­?, lit. Limited Moon Reading) and transports the two into an alternate reality. There, Naruto is known as Menma (Ã£Æ’Â¡Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£Æ’Å¾?); SakuraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents are heroes who defended Konoha from the Nine Tailed Fox with their lives; all their peers have opposite personalities; and NarutoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, are alive. Shortly after, Naruto and Sakura participate in a mission to retrieve the Red Moon scroll which details on how to defeat an enemy of that world known as the masked man. During the mission, Kushina is injured when she protects Naruto and dissuades NarutoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refusal to bond with his parents.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2290828/\nRelease Date: 28 July 2012 (Japan)\nGenre: Animation | Action | Adventure\nStars : Junko Takeuchi, Chie Nakamura, Toshiyuki Morikawa\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: SHQ@Ganool\nSource: 1080p BluRay AVC DTS-HD MA\nSize: 800MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:373c8103fe04d101319b6f82a879de2accab88d2","amp;dn":"Road+to+Ninja%3A+Naruto+the+Movie+%282012%29+BluRay+720p+800MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"373c8103fe04d101319b6f82a879de2accab88d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,60,129,3,254,4,209,1,49,155,111,130,168,121,222,42,204,171,136,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
