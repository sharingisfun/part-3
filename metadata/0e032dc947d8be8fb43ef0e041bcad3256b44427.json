Chevy Chase is Tony, the cop assigned to protect Gloria. Dudley Moore is a surprisingly kinky symphony conductor. There are grandmothers playing Scrabble with expletives, Burgess Meredith's snake Esme, and an old Japanese couple in the back of the careening limo. What more can I say?\n  This is great little feel good screwball comedy from the 70's.\n\n  Starring: Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase, Dudley Moore, Burgess Meredith, Rachel Roberts, Eugene Roche.\n\n  Directed by: Colin Higgins.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 56min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 608 x 352\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e032dc947d8be8fb43ef0e041bcad3256b44427","amp;dn":"Foul+Play+%281978%29+%28Goldie+Hawn%2C+Chevy+Chase%2C+Dudley+Moore%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e032dc947d8be8fb43ef0e041bcad3256b44427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,3,45,201,71,216,190,143,180,62,240,224,65,188,173,50,86,180,68,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
