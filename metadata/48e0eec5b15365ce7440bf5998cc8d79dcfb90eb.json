Unfortunately the tavern has seen better days. With only two functioning rooms, crumbling architecture, and an ever-diminishing reputation there is plenty of room for improvement.\r\nCan you turn this dilapidated ruin into a thriving business? In a fantasy world filled with cunning wizards, tricky elves, cat obsessed gnomes, grumpy dwarves, and sad fairies it certainly isnâ€™t going to be easy, especially if you want them all to stay happy under one roof. If you are going to make a go of it there is a lot to do: staff to hire, meals to cook, ingredients to forage, quests to undertake, and gods to appease. Yet if you can survive the brutal world that surrounds you there is definitely a profit to be made!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e0eec5b15365ce7440bf5998cc8d79dcfb90eb","amp;dn":"Moonstone+Tavern+-+A+Fantasy+Tavern+Sim%21+v1.0.0.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e0eec5b15365ce7440bf5998cc8d79dcfb90eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,224,238,197,177,83,101,206,116,64,191,89,152,204,141,121,220,251,144,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
