With new breakthroughs in modern neuroscience and the wisdom of thousands of years of contemplative practice, it is possible for us to shape our own thoughts in a similar way for greater happiness, love, compassion, and wisdom.\n\nBuddha's Brain joins the forces of modern neuroscience with ancient contemplative teachings to show readers how they can work toward greater emotional well-being, healthier relationships, more effective actions, and deepened religious and spiritual understanding. This book will explain how the core elements of both psychological well-being and religious or spiritual life-virtue, mindfulness, and wisdom-are based in the core functions of the brain: regulating, learning, and valuing. Readers will also learn practical ways to apply this information, as the book offers many exercises they can do to tap the unused potential of the brain and rewire it over time for greater peace and well-being.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4ee40dcbaa033cc9b4a45f038a15a82fdc4090","amp;dn":"Rick+Hanson+-+Buddha%27s+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4ee40dcbaa033cc9b4a45f038a15a82fdc4090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,78,228,13,203,170,3,60,201,180,164,95,3,138,21,168,47,220,64,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
