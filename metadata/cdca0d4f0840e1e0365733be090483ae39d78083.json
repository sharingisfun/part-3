Eighteen or nineteen of his plays have survived complete (depending if one includes his authorship of RHESUS) and there are also fragments, some substantial, of most of the other plays.  More of his plays have survived intact than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together, partly due to mere chance and partly because his popularity grew as theirs declined -- he became, in the Hellenistic Age, a cornerstone of ancient literary education, along with Homer, Demosthenes and Menander.\n\nEuripides is identified with theatrical innovations that have profoundly influenced drama down to modern times, especially in the representation of traditional, mythical heroes as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  This new approach led him to pioneer developments that later writers adapted to comedy, some of which are characteristic of romance.  Yet he also became &quot;the most tragic of poets&quot;, focusing on the inner lives and motives of his characters in a way previously unknown.\n\nHis contemporaries associated him with Socrates as a leader of a decadent intellectualism, both of them being frequently lampooned by comic poets such as Aristophanes.  Whereas Socrates was eventually put on trial and executed as a corrupting influence, Euripides chose a voluntary exile in old age, dying in Macedonia.\n\n\nAll the following books are in PDF format:\n\n* ALCESTIS / MEDEA / HIPPOLYTUS (Hackett, 2007).
