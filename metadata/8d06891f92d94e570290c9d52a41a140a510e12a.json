Both parties have an unspoken agreement never to repeat what is said. Not even to their spouses. The Audience breaks this contract of silence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and imagines a series of pivotal meetings between the Downing Street incumbents and their Queen. From Churchill to Cameron, each Prime Minister has used these private conversations as a sounding board and a confessional Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sometimes intimate, sometimes explosive.\n\nFrom young mother to grandmother, these private audiences chart the arc of the second Elizabethan Age. Politicians come and go through the revolving door of electoral politics, while she remains constant, waiting to welcome her next Prime Minister.\n\nThe Audience reunites writer Peter Morgan and Academy Award-winning actress Helen Mirren following their collaboration on the critically-acclaimed movie sensation The Queen.\n\nThe Audience is directed by Academy Award-nominated director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours) and presented in the West End by Matthew Byam Shaw for Playful Productions, Robert Fox and Andy Harries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d06891f92d94e570290c9d52a41a140a510e12a","amp;dn":"THE+AUDIENCE+NTLive+06.13.2013+HDTV+1080p+AC3+MME","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d06891f92d94e570290c9d52a41a140a510e12a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,6,137,31,146,217,78,87,2,144,201,213,42,65,161,64,165,16,225,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
