Featuring singer and bassist Mlny Parsonz, drummer Lee Smith, and guitarist Josh Coleman, the band's hazy, psychedelic sound evokes the early days of stoner and space rock, with Parsonz's soulful vocals bringing an element of dark drama to the band's swaggering sound. Royal Thunder made their recorded debut in 2009 with a self-titled EP, which the band self-released before signing to Relapse shortly afterwards, where the label re-released the album the following year. Their first full-length, CVI, arrived two years later in 2012. Enjoy and support the artist.\n\nCrooked Thunder:\n\n1. Time Machine\n2. Forget You\n3. Wake Up\n4. Floor\n5. The Line\n6.
