It's something to 'control', 'do battle with', all in a warped quest to 'be thin' and live up to society's photoshopped ideals. Plus there's the obesity epidemic where we've trained our tastebuds to crave the fat, salt and sugar that so much junk food is saturated with. \nBy examining the pyschological factors that encourage us to eat more than we know we should, as well as the tricks used by marketers to influence what and how much we eat, Change the Way You Eat provides the tools for readers to take ownership of their eating choices so that lifelong change can take place. Discover how: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ our stage of life, gender, financial resources and values all influence our food choices \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ branding, packaging and labelling combine to manipulate our shopping habits \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ our inbuilt taste preferences can determine the food weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re drawn to, and how to reprogram them \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ our environment Ã¢â‚¬â€ from the type of music playing while we eat to the number of people we eat with Ã¢â‚¬â€ can all affect our eating habits \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ our personality and emotions can determine our food choices and habits, and \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ we can implement our newfound knowledge to take back control of our plate, become conscious eaters and gain real enjoyment from nourishing ourselves in a way that promotes long-term health and happiness.\n\nLeanne Cooper is an author, educator, nutrition consultant and advisor.
