In addition, detailed instruction and documentation provided with the code samples will allow even novice Python programmers to add their own unique twists or use the models presented to build new solutions.\n\nRapid development of new cybercrime investigation tools is an essential ingredient in virtually every case and environment. Whether you are performing post-mortem investigation, executing live triage, extracting evidence from mobile devices or cloud services, or you are collecting and processing evidence from a network, Python forensic implementations can fill in the gaps.\n\nDrawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and illustrative code samples, author Chet Hosmer discusses how to:\n\nDevelop new forensic solutions independent of large vendor software release schedules\nParticipate in an open-source workbench that facilitates direct involvement in the design and implementation of new methods that augment or replace existing tools\nAdvance your career by creating new solutions along with the construction of cutting-edge automation solutions to solve old problems\n\nProvides hands-on tools, code samples, and detailed instruction and documentation that can be put to use immediately\nDiscusses how to create a Python forensics workbench\nCovers effective forensic searching and indexing using Python\nShows how to use Python to examine mobile device operating systems: iOS, Android, and Windows 8\nPresents complete coverage of how to use Python scripts for network investigation\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f347e781ac2c7719404c2402890afe618d3af6e6","amp;dn":"Python+Forensics+%28Syngress%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f347e781ac2c7719404c2402890afe618d3af6e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,71,231,129,172,44,119,25,64,76,36,2,137,10,254,97,141,58,246,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
