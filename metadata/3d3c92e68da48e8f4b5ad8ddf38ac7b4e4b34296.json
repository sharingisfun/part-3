While appropriate for all skill levels, new scrollers will benefit from a comprehensive section devoted to basic skills. This section includes articles pulled directly from the pages of Scroll Saw Woodworking &amp; Crafts on such essential subjects as choosing blades and wood, cutting, pattern placement, sanding, and safety. Beginners get plenty of advice on these basics before moving forward with novice projects, including simple Christmas motifs, a maple-leaf pattern, and a curious cat. Not to be overlooked, a variety of intermediate and advanced patterns and projects are also included, along with the techniques needed to create themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½such as compound cutting for a chess set, fretworking for an intricate Victorian doll bed, intarsia for holiday ornaments, and stack cutting for a classic corner shelf. Seasoned woodworkers will enjoy the chapter committed to using unusual materials such as corian, coins, stained glass, and vellum. Each pattern design is taken from the workshops of today's top designers, including Rick Hutcheson, John Nelson, Gary MacKay, Karen Longabaugh, Sue Mey, Kathy Wise, and Gary Browning.\nAbout the Author\n\nScroll Saw Woodworking &amp; Crafts is the leading magazine for wood crafters and scroll saw artists, providing step-by-step projects and original patterns from the world's best designers.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 189 pages\n    * Publisher: Fox Chapel Publishing; 1 edition (December 1, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 156523426X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1565234260","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d3c92e68da48e8f4b5ad8ddf38ac7b4e4b34296","amp;dn":"Big+Book+Of+Scroll+Saw+Woodworking%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d3c92e68da48e8f4b5ad8ddf38ac7b4e4b34296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,60,146,230,141,164,142,143,75,90,216,221,243,138,199,180,228,179,66,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
