Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah, ah, ah. \n\nI gotta roll, can't stand still, got a flame in my heart, can't get my fill. \nEyes that shine burning red, dreams of you all through my head. \n\nAh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah. \n\nHey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby, Tell me won't you you do me now. \n\nDidn't take too long 'fore I found out, what people mean my down and out. \nSpent my money, took my car, started telling her friends she wants to be a star. \nI don't know but I been told, a big-legged woman ain't got no soul. \n\n* Chorus \n\nAll I ask for when I pray, steady rollin' woman gonna come my way. \nNeed a woman gonna hold my hand, won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRock And Roll \n(Bonham/Jones/Page/Plant) \n\nIt's been a long time since I rock and rolled, \nIt's been a long time since I did the Stroll. \nOoh, let me get it back, let me get it back, \nLet me get it back, baby, where I come from. \nIt's been a long time, been a long time, \nBeen a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. Yes it has. \n\nIt's been a long time since the book of love, \nI can't count the tears of a life with no love. \nCarry me back, carry me back, \nCarry me back, baby, where I come from. \nIt's been a long time, been a long time, \nBeen a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. \n\nSeems so long since we walked in the moonlight, \nMaking vows that just can't work right. \nOpen your arms, opens your arms, \nOpen your arms, baby, let my love come running in. \nIt's been a long time, been a long time, \nBeen a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Battle Of Evermore \n(Page/Plant) \n\nQueen of Light took her bow, And then she turned to go, \nThe Prince of Peace embraced the gloom, And walked the night alone. \n\nOh, dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light. \nThe dark Lord rides in force tonight, And time will tell us all. \n\nOh, throw down your plow and hoe, Rest not to lock your homes. \n\nSide by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all. \n\nI hear the horses' thunder down in the valley blow, \nI'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow. \n\nThe apples of the valley hold, The seas of happiness, \nThe ground is rich from tender care, Repay, do not forget, no, no. \nDance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light. \n\nThe apples turn to brown and black, The tyrant's face is red. \n\nOh the war is common cry, Pick up you swords and fly. \nThe sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know. \n\nOh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow, \nTired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow. \n\nThe pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath, \nThe drums will shake the castle wall, the ring wraiths ride in black, Ride on. \n\nSing as you raise your bow, shoot straighter than before. \nNo comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold. \n\nOh dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light. \nThe magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back. Bring it back. \n\nAt last the sun is shining, The clouds of blue roll by, \nWith flames from the dragon of darkness, the sunlight blinds his eyes. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStairway To Heaven\n(Page/Plant) \n\nThere's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold \nAnd she's buying a stairway to heaven. \nWhen she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed \nWith a word she can get what she came for. \nOoh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. \n\nThere's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure \n'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. \nIn a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, \nSometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. \nOoh, it makes me wonder, \nOoh, it makes me wonder. \n\nThere's a feeling I get when I look to the west, \nAnd my spirit is crying for leaving. \nIn my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, \nAnd the voices of those who standing looking. \nOoh, it makes me wonder, \nOoh, it really makes me wonder. \n\nAnd it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune \nThen the piper will lead us to reason. \nAnd a new day will dawn for those who stand long \nAnd the forests will echo with laughter. \n\nIf there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, \nIt's just a spring clean for the May queen. \nYes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run \nThere's still time to change the road you're on. \nAnd it makes me wonder. \n\nYour head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, \nThe piper's calling you to join him, \nDear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know \nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind. \n\nAnd as we wind on down the road \nOur shadows taller than our soul. \nThere walks a lady we all know \nWho shines white light and wants to show \nHow everything still turns to gold. \nAnd if you listen very hard \nThe tune will come to you at last. \nWhen all are one and one is all \nTo be a rock and not to roll. \n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to heaven. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMisty Mountain Hop \n(Jones/Page/Plant) \n\nWalkin' in the park just the other day, Baby, \nWhat do you, what do you think I saw? \nCrowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said, \n&quot;Hey, Boy, do you wanna score?&quot; \nAnd you know how it is; \nI really don't know what time it was, woh, oh, \nSo I asked them if I could stay awhile. \n\nI didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really, \nReally out of my mind. \nJust then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said, \n&quot;Please, hey, would we care to all get in line, \nGet in line.&quot; \nWell you know, They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, \nOh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, ooh. \n\nWhy don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see, \nAnd Baby, Baby, Baby, do you like it? \nThere you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin' \nAh, not trying to fight it. \nYou really don't care if they're coming, oh, oh, \nI know that it's all a state of mind, ooh. \n\nIf you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better, \nYou better open your eyes. \nFolk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't \nWhich, which way the pressure lies, \nSo I've decided what I'm gonna do now. \nSo I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains \nWhere the spirits go now, \nOver the hills where the spirits fly, ooh. \nI really don't know. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFour Sticks \n(Page/Plant) \n\nOh, Baby, it's cryin' time, Oh, Baby, I got to fly. \nGot to try to find a way, Got to try to get away, \n'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, Babe. \n\nOh, Baby, the river's red, Oh, Baby, in my head. \nThere's a funny feelin' goin' on, I don't think I can hold out long. \n\n*And when the owls cry in the night, Oh, Baby, Baby, when the pines begin to cry, \nBaby, Baby, Baby, how do you feel? If the river runs dry, Baby, \nHow do you feel? \n\nCraze, Baby, the rainbow's end, Baby, it's just a den \nFor those who hide, Who hide their love to depths of life \nAnd ruin dreams that we all knew so, Babe. \n\n* Chorus \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGoing To California\n(Page/Plant) \n\nSpent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine. \nMade up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart. \nSomeone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair. \nTook my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same. \nThe sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today. \nThe mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake \nas the children of the sun began to awake. \n\nSeems that the wrath of the Gods \nGot a punch on the nose and it started to flow; \nI think I might be sinking. \nThrow me a line if I reach it in time \nI'll meet you up there where the path \nRuns straight and high. \n\nTo find a queen without a king, \nThey say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la \nRide a white mare in the footsteps of dawn \nTryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born. \nStanding on a hill in my mountain of dreams, \nTelling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen The Levee Breaks\n(Bonham/Jones/Page/Plant/Memphis Minnie) \n\nIf it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break, (X2) \nWhen The Levee Breaks I'll have no place to stay. \n\nMean old levee taught me to weep and moan, (X2) \nGot what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home, \nOh, well, oh, well, oh, well. \n\nDon't it make you feel bad \nWhen you're tryin' to find your way home, \nYou don't know which way to go? \nIf you're goin' down South \nThey go no work to do, \nIf you don't know about Chicago. \n\nCryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good, \nNow, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good, \nWhen the levee breaks, mama, you got to move. \n\nAll last night sat on the levee and moaned, (X2) \nThinkin' about me baby and my happy home. \nGoing, going to Chicago... Going to Chicago... Sorry but I can't take you... \nGoing down... going down now... going down.... \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6261dfc4c1462e21311c9d270841d554379aad71","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+1971+IV+2011+Remastered+%26+Arts+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6261dfc4c1462e21311c9d270841d554379aad71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,97,223,196,193,70,46,33,49,28,157,39,8,65,213,84,55,154,173,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
