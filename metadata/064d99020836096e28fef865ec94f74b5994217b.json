He was awarded the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;principally for his great novel, Buddenbrooks, which has won steadily increased recognition as one of the classic works of contemporary literature.&quot;\n\nMann's first novel, BUDDENBROOKS (1901), won both popular and critical acclaim.  Deeply indebted to the German cultural tradition and specifically influenced by Schopenhauer, Wagner, and Nietzsche, Mann combines &quot;intellectual&quot; themes with vivid realism and comic flair.  Much of his work including the early novellas, &quot;Tonio KrÃ¶ger&quot; and &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, explores the psychology of the creative temperament and the often tragic position of the intellectual or artist in bourgeois society.  Politically he became an increasingly outspoken opponent of European fascism, a concern reflected in his second major novel, THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN (1924), and in subsequent works.\n\nHis most important later works were the monumental tetralogy JOSEPH AND HIS BROTHERS (1933-1943), a reinterpretation of the biblical story as the emergence of mobile, responsible individuality out of the tribal collective, of history out of myth, and of a human God out of the unknowable;  THE BELOVED RETURNS (1939), in which Mann returned to the world of Goethe's novel &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; (1774); and the great tragic novel, DOCTOR FAUSTUS (1947), the story of composer Adrian LeverkÃ¼hn and the corruption of German culture in the years before and during World War II.  He also extended the comic picaresque fragment, CONFESSIONS OF FELIX KRULL, which he had begun at the time of &quot;Death in Venice&quot;; it was never finished but appeared as his last novel in 1954.\n\nThis collection also features a large selection of Mann's essays, non-fiction, letters, and wartime speeches, many of which have been long out-of-print.  The literary essays in particular make for marvellous reading, with insightful contributions on Goethe, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Lessing, Kleist, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Schiller, Wagner, Freud, and many others.  Several autobiographical works are here, including Mann's remarkable memoir about the writing of DOCTOR FAUSTUS, its evolution shaped by world events and a personal health crisis, as well as three volumes of letters, including a new scan of his decades-long correspondence with Hermann Hesse.\n\nI am indebted to @pharmakate for allowing me to include a number of original scans of John Wood's superb recent translations.\n\n\nThe following are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated\n\n                         == NOVELS &amp; NOVELLAS ==                                   \n\n* The Beloved Returns: Lotte in Weimar (Knopf, 1940; 1968).
