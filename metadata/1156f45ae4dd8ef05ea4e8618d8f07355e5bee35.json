Some writers start at the beginning and let the story unfold without a plan. They are called &quot;pantsers,&quot; because they write by the &quot;seat of the pants.&quot;\n\nOther writers plan and outline and know the ending before they start. These are the &quot;plotters.&quot;\n\nThe two sides never seem to agree with each other on the best approach.\n\nBut what if it's not the beginning or the end that is the key to a successful book? What if, amazing as it may seem, the place to begin writing your novel is in the very middle of the story?\n\nAccording to #1 bestselling writing teacher James Scott Bell, that's exactly where you'll find your story's heart and heat. Bell's &quot;Mirror Moment&quot; is the secret, and its power is available to any writer, at any stage of the writing process.\n\nBringing together years of craft study and personal discovery, Bell presents a truly unique approach to writing a novel, one that will stand the test of time and serve you all your writing life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1156f45ae4dd8ef05ea4e8618d8f07355e5bee35","amp;dn":"Write+Your+Novel+From+The+Middle+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1156f45ae4dd8ef05ea4e8618d8f07355e5bee35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,86,244,90,228,221,142,240,94,164,232,97,141,143,7,53,94,91,238,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
