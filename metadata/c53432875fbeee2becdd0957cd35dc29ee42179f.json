How could an ancient Sanskrit text contain an account which could only be of a journey in an alien craft?\n\nCompare photographs of American space centre launch sites to the constructions on the plains of Nazca in Peru. In order to understand the mysteries which Erich Von Daniken has cataloqued we must go back to these ancient relics with an open mind. We must call in the resources and experience of sciences other than archaeology. \n\nRead Von Daniken's classic work and make up your own mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c53432875fbeee2becdd0957cd35dc29ee42179f","amp;dn":"Erich.Von.Daniken.Chariots.Of.The.Gods.BD.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c53432875fbeee2becdd0957cd35dc29ee42179f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,52,50,135,95,190,238,43,236,221,9,87,205,53,220,41,238,66,23,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
