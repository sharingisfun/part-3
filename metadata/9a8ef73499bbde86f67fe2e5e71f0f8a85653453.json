This is a common task for show openers or to add extra information into your shot. We'll begin this tutorial by importing our background plate and creating the text we'll integrate. Then we'll track the background plate and attach our text to the track. We'll then learn about the uses of pre-composing and how to combine various effects to make our text look more three dimensional. We'll then learn how to take elements from our background and layer them into our text to create the illusion that the text is in the scene. We'll finish the tutorial by doing a quick color correction and render out our finished shot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a8ef73499bbde86f67fe2e5e71f0f8a85653453","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Integrating+Titles+with+Footage+in+After+Effect","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a8ef73499bbde86f67fe2e5e71f0f8a85653453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,142,247,52,153,187,222,134,246,127,226,229,231,31,15,138,133,101,52,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
