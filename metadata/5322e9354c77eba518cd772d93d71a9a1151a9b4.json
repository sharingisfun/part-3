All dialogue written by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino has a knack for picking superb backing tracks for his films, ...    Full Descriptionand the soundtrack to his bold debut, RESERVOIR DOGS, is no exception. Nestled between Steven Wright's sad-sack song announcements is the disc's opening tune, the George Baker Selection's &quot;Little Green Bag,&quot; a shuffling groove with a faux-tropical melody line that's hard to shake, followed by Blue Swede's candy-coated pop gem &quot;Hooked on a Feeling,&quot; with its unmistakable &quot;hooga-chakka&quot; intro.\n\nJoe Tex's eminently funky &quot;I Gotcha&quot; and the too-cool-for-school &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; by Stealers Wheel are killers, while Sandy Rogers's &quot;Fool for Love&quot; and Harry Nilsson's charming &quot;Coconut&quot; round out the soundtrack's essentials. The rest of the disc is filled in with the band Bedlam's covers of &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot; and &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; and separately tracked selections of dialogue from the amazingly influential film.\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  VA       \nAlbum     -  Reservoir Dogs Soundtrack                                          \nGenre     -  Various                                             \nLabel     -  MCA\nYear      -  1992                                            \nTracks    -  16                                               \nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  71.9 MB\nkbps      -  320\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                         \nI will seed my torrents for about one week.
