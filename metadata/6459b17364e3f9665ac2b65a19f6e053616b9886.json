Hundreds of North Americans have traveled to San Miguel to cook with Hugh during the 6-day seminars that he runs with his wife, Teri Sandison, during the winter months. The recipes are based on Hugh's cooking school in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, a famous artist community located in the high mountain country north of Mexico City.\nMexican Flavors includes classic recipes such as Guacamole, Tortilla Soup, and Barbecue Chicken with Mole Sauce. But there are many gastronomic surprises such as Banana Salsa, Quesadillas with Papaya and Brie, Barbecued Caesar Salad with Chile Croutons, and Fallen Kahlua Chocolate Cake. The recipes use a wide range of seasonings to achieve innovative flavors with a Mexican flair - all from ingredients available at every American supermarket. Throughout the book, Hugh is at your side showing you easy preparation and cooking techniques, what can be completed in advance, and in page-after-page illuminating the techniques, the history, and the unique flavors of Mexican cuisine.\nThree special sections show an innovative approach to some of Mexico's most famous dishes. Chile Rellenos are filled with Pulled Pork or a Pine Nut Goat Cheese Herb stuffing, and then smoked on the barbecue. Tacos and tostadas are deconstructed so that even those new to Mexican cuisine can create their own masterpiece. And enchiladas, with their fillings of duck, shrimp, or shiitake mushrooms, are a master class on fail-safe ways to create perfection.\n\nAcclaimed as a food photographer, Teri Sandison brings the recipes to life with stunning food photographs. She shows equal skill capturing the mood of San Miguel through shots of everyday life, festivals, markets scenes, and cooking class action shots. Visit San Miguel, a UNESCO World Heritage city, through the lens of Teri's camera. Open Mexican Flavors and step into the life of San Miguel de Allende; walk through the farmer's markets; people-watch on the Jardin; see behind the doors of old colonial homes; and attend the cooking classes at Camp San Miguel.
