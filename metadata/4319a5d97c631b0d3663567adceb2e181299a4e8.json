An Introduction To Indian Music\n2. DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡drÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡\n3. MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ru-BihÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡g\n4. Bhimpalasi\n5. Sindhi-Bhairavi\n\nThis 1960s classic is a perfect introduction not only to Ravi Shankar's brilliant work on the sitar, but also to classical Indian music in general. Shankar offers brief, informative explanations of Indian ragas, scales, rhythms, song structures, and time signatures to set the stage for each spiritual piece he, Chatur Lal (tabla), and N.C. Mullick (tamboura) perform. Though Western listeners may not be able intellectually to pinpoint the subtle purposes of the various ragas' rhythms and movements, unconsciously listeners will feel them vividly. For instance, the plodding tension created by the 2/3/2/3 rhythm in &quot;MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ru-BihÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡g&quot; well reflects the raga's poetic metaphor of separated, longing lovers. The loose, playful improvisation on &quot;Sindhi-Bhairavi&quot; mirrors the passionate romance of lovers. Overall, classical Indian music is diverse and complex, but The Sounds of India simplifies it beautifully for those interested in exploring it and its greatest ambassador.\nKaren Karleski\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4319a5d97c631b0d3663567adceb2e181299a4e8","amp;dn":"Ravi+Shankar+-+The+Sounds+Of+India","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4319a5d97c631b0d3663567adceb2e181299a4e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,25,165,217,124,99,27,13,54,99,86,122,220,235,46,24,18,153,164,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
