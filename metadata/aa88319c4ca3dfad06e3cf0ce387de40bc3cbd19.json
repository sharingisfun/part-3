He was popular for his pop/rock and New Wave music early on before moving to more eclectic, though less commercially successful, pop/jazz/classical hybrids. \n\n\nGold 2008\n\nThis Is It! (The A&amp;M Years 1979Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1989), released in February 1997, is a Joe Jackson compilation double album, covering his period with A&amp;M Records between 1979 and 1989.\n\nAllmusic journalist, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, states, &quot;... is a double-disc, 37-track collection covering Joe Jackson's commercial and creative heyday. Over the course of two discs, This Is It! runs through all of his biggest hits Ã¢â‚¬â€ &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot;, &quot;It's Different for Girls,&quot; &quot;Steppin' Out&quot;, &quot;Breaking Us in Two&quot;, &quot;You Can't Get What Want (Till You Know What You Want)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ plus a number of significant album tracks and lesser-known singles, making it a comprehensive retrospective of Jackson's pop-oriented work. While it's unfortunate that the compilation stops just short of his last pop album, 1991's Laughter &amp; Lust, because it was released on Virgin Records, the great majority of his best work is here, making it a perfect choice for fans who want something more Ã¢â‚¬â€ and better assembled Ã¢â‚¬â€ than Greatest Hits, and those who don't want to dig as deep as the actual albums&quot;.[3]\n\nIn his book, The Great Rock Discography, journalist Martin C. Strong awards the album 8 out of 10.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; - 3:40\n2.\t&quot;Fools in Love&quot; - 4:31\n3.\t&quot;One More Time&quot; - 3:19\n4.\t&quot;Sunday Papers&quot; - 4:23\n5.\t&quot;Look Sharp!&quot; - 3:26\n6.\t&quot;Got the Time&quot; [live] - 4:45\n7.\t&quot;On Your Radio&quot; - 4:04\n8.\t&quot;It's Different for Girls&quot; - 3:45\n9.\t&quot;Don't Wanna Be Like That&quot; - 3:45\n10.\t&quot;Amateur Hour&quot; - 4:10\n11.\t&quot;I'm the Man&quot; - 4:00\n12.\t&quot;Tilt&quot; - 2:48\n13.\t&quot;Someone up There&quot; - 3:51\n14.\t&quot;One to One&quot; - 3:26\n15.\t&quot;Beat Crazy&quot; - 4:18\n16.\t&quot;Biology&quot; - 4:35\n17.\t&quot;Jumpin' Jive&quot; (Cab Calloway/Frank Froeba/Jack Palmer) - 2:43\n18.\t&quot;What's the Use of Getting Sober (When You're Gonna Get Drunk Again)?&quot; (Bill Meyers) - 3:48\n19.\t&quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; [live] - 4:36\n20.\t&quot;Another World&quot; - 4:13\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Breaking Us in Two&quot; - 4:50\n2.\t&quot;Chinatown&quot; - 4:28\n3.\t&quot;Real Men&quot; - 4:05\n4.\t&quot;Steppin' Out&quot; - 4:22\n5.\t&quot;A Slow Song&quot; - 7:00\n6.\t&quot;You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)&quot; - 4:55\n7.\t&quot;Not Here, Not Now&quot; - 5:30\n8.\t&quot;Be My Number Two&quot; - 4:24\n9.\t&quot;Happy Ending&quot; - 3:40\n10.\t&quot;Wild West&quot; - 4:35\n11.\t&quot;Right and Wrong&quot; - 4:37\n12.\t&quot;Home Town&quot; - 3:14\n13.\t&quot;Precious Time&quot; - 3:24\n14.\t&quot;Me and You (Against the World)&quot; - 3:52\n15.\t&quot;Down to London&quot; - 4:18\n16.\t&quot;Nineteen Forever&quot; - 5:45\n17.\t&quot;The Human Touch&quot; - 5:10\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa88319c4ca3dfad06e3cf0ce387de40bc3cbd19","amp;dn":"Joe+Jackson+-+Gold+%282+CD+Greatest+Hits%29+2008+%5BFLAC%5D++-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa88319c4ca3dfad06e3cf0ce387de40bc3cbd19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,136,49,156,76,163,223,173,6,227,207,12,227,135,222,64,188,60,189,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
