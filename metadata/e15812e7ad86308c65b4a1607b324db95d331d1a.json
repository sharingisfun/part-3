Anna Funder tells extraordinary tales from the underbelly of the former East Germany.\n\nIn a country where the headquarters of the secret police could become a museum literally overnight, and one in 50 East Germans were informing on their fellow citizens, there are thousands of captivating stories. She meets Miriam, who, as a 16-year-old, might have started World War III; she visits the man who painted the line that became the Berlin Wall; and she gets drunk with the legendary &quot;Mik Jegger&quot; of the east, once declared by the authorities to his face to &quot;no longer to exist.&quot;\n\nEach enthralling story depicts what it's like to live in Berlin as the city knits itself back together - or fails to. This is a history full of emotion, attitude, and complexity.\n\nÃ‚Â©2003 Anna Funder; (P)2009 Audible\n\nAudible Audio Edition\nListening Length: 10 hours and 38 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Audible Studios\nAudible.com Release Date: November 23, 2009\nWhispersync for Voice: Ready\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B002YJZE8S\n\nDenica Fairman (Narrator)\n\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
