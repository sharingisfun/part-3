History shows that all civilization derives from the\nwhite race, that none can exist without its help, and that a society is great\nand brilliant only so far as it preserves the blood of the noble group that \ncreated it&quot;.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\nThe following is an added excerpt form the net:\nIn this illuminating and thoughtful book, Will and Ariel Durant have succeeded\nin distilling for the reader the accumulated store of knowledge and experience\nfrom their four decades of work on the ten monumental volumes of The Story of\nCivilization. The result is a survey of human history, full of dazzling insights \ninto the nature of human experience, the evolution of civilization, the culture of \nman. With the completion of their life's work they look back and ask what history \nhas to say about the nature, the conduct and the prospects of man, seeking in the \ngreat lives, the great ideas, the great events of the past for the meaning of man's \nlong journey through war, conquest and creationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and for the great themes that can \nhelp us to understand our own era.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bcbc60685dc63e29f175aefd5be8587b8018962","amp;dn":"Will+and+Ariel+Durant+The+Lessons+of+History+Arthur+de+Gobineau","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bcbc60685dc63e29f175aefd5be8587b8018962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,203,198,6,133,220,99,226,159,23,90,239,213,190,133,135,184,1,137,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
