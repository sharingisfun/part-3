It&amp;#039;s just so gorgeous and couldn&amp;#039;t be duplicated today...just a strange feeling is captured here, amplified because it&amp;#039;s populated with so many hedonistic weirdos and perverts. Of course, these slight perks only exist because Waters and his crew were completely inept in the technical ways of cinema.\n\nContent wise...this has at least a flash or two of brilliance, which is impressive for a film that cost around &quot;5000&quot; bucks. The opening at the Calvacade of Perversions is great (&quot;She&amp;#039;s not a tramp. She&amp;#039;s an auto-erotica copraphrasiac and a gerontophiliac!&quot;), but I don&amp;#039;t know what to make out of all the dated cultural references (too much Manson/Tate stuff)...then there&amp;#039;s an incredibly tedious and overlong delusion with Divine narrating her version of Christ. Even more time is padded with endless scenes of characters sitting and/or lying in bed talking (and often forgetting their lines), plus topless gitterbugging from Cookie Mueller, people riding around in cars and Mink Stole (&quot;the religious whore&quot;) and Divine walking down the street.\n\nDespite all that, the closing sequences (starting with Lobstra) make up for it and are just priceless. Best use of the song &quot;God Bless America&quot; here! And the film is still unique and original 30+ years later, so I give it credit for that.[/QUOTE]\n\n-------my rip------\n\n~~~~~~ Multiple Maniacs.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,137,438,720                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:30:32                \nFrame Count:....................................130237             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................672                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................496                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.355                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1528                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP..................N-VOP......                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.191&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................134                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2        ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e57400768686945e771f273a1d1efd64e0745d13","amp;dn":"Multiple+Maniacs+-+John+Waters+1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e57400768686945e771f273a1d1efd64e0745d13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,116,0,118,134,134,148,94,119,31,39,58,29,30,253,100,224,116,93,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
