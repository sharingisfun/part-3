Using the city as your weapon, you will embark on a personal mission to inflict your own brand of justice.\n\nChicago's overarching network is known as the Central Operating System (ctOS), and it controls almost all of the city's technology and information - including key data on all of the city's residents.\n\nYou play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. While seeking justice for those events, you'll monitor and hack those around you by manipulating the ctOS from the palm of your hand. You'll access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy... and more.\n\n#################################################\n\nFAQs\nQ: Is this the full game?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Does this require Steam?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Does this require Ubisoft Uplay?\nA: No.\n\nQ: Does this require a CD to play?\nA: No.\n\nQ: What version is this?\nA: 1.06.329 (Update 6)\n\nQ: Which crack is used?\nA: 3DM (Launcher version).
