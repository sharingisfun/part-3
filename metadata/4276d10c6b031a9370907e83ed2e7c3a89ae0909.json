Where would you go? What would you do? Davy can teleport. To survive, Davy must learn to use and control his power in a world that is more violent and complex than he ever imagined. But mere survival is not enough for him. Davy wants to find others like himself, others who can Jump.\n\nReflex\n\nDavy has always been alone. He believes that he's the only person in the world who can teleport. But what if he isn't? A mysterious group of people has taken Davy captive. They don't want to hire him, and they don't have any hope of appealing to him to help them. What they want is to own him. They want to use his abilities for their own purposes, whether Davy agrees to it or not. And so they set about brainwashing him and conditioning him. They have even found a way to keep a teleport captive. But there's one thing that they don't know. No one knows it, not even Davy. And it might save his life....\n\nGriffin's Story\n\nGriffin has a secret. It's a secret that he's sworn to his parents to keep, and never tell. Griffin is a Jumper: a person who can teleport to any place he has ever been. The first time was when he was five, and his parents crossed an ocean to protect the secret. The most important time was when he was nine. That was the day that the men came to his house and murdered his parents. Griffin knows that the men were looking for him, and he must never let them find him.\n\nGriffin grows up with only two goals: to survive, and to kill the people who want him dead. And a Jumper bent on revenge is not going to let anything stand in his way.\n\nImpulse\n\nCent has a secret. She lives in isolation, with her parents, hiding from the people who took her father captive and tortured him to gain control over his ability to teleport, and from the government agencies who want to use his talent. Cent has seen the world, but only from the safety of her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ arms. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teleported more than anyone on Earth, except for her mother and father, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been able to do it herself. Her life has never been in danger.\n\nUntil the day when she went snowboarding without permission and triggered an avalanche. When the snow and ice thundered down on her, she suddenly found herself in her own bedroom. That was the first time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4276d10c6b031a9370907e83ed2e7c3a89ae0909","amp;dn":"Jumper+Series+-+Steven+Gould","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4276d10c6b031a9370907e83ed2e7c3a89ae0909","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,118,209,12,107,3,26,147,112,144,126,131,237,46,124,58,137,174,9,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
