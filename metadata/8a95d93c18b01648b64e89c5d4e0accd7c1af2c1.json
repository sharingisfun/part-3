ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a simple riff with a good melody, \nplayed with lots of energy.\nFronted by Swedish soul-saviour, Elin Larsson, her voice is a powerful mix of Janis Joplin meets Aretha Franklin. Larsson isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t coy to show off her \ncompelling chords as the EP starts off with a 40 second vocal solo to introduce Ã¢â‚¬ËœDevil ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. \nLarssonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a hell of a backbone for a band behind her, the newest and youngest of which is guitarist Dorian Sorriaux whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playing is heavily \n70s-influenced. Drummer Cory Berry carefully masters the hard hitting edge of their rockier side but also has a feather touch dynamic during their softer \nsongs like Ã¢â‚¬ËœDig InÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The greatest part about this band is their ability to take the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Cream and Aretha Franklin and \nturn it into a sound that is groundbreaking and inventive and most importantly, one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all of their own.  This is not just a fad band, Blues Pills has \ncreated timeless soul rock. Whichever genre you want to fall into, Devil Man has moments to both surprise and delight everyone. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s edgy and riffy and \ntranquil and calm simultaneously. The perfect antidote to everyone searching for a sound that tells them how they should feel. In fact, maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the \nperfect sound. This is a superb offering from such a youthful band. The only downside is that after 17 minutes and 4 songs it ends.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible not to like this album. Every one of its four members has a special talent, which flourishes and speaks out in confidence. Go back to the \npast and be thrown into the forefront of rock simultaneously. This really is an out-of-body band. Learn, listen and love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a95d93c18b01648b64e89c5d4e0accd7c1af2c1","amp;dn":"Blues+Pills+-+Devil+Man+EP+%28320CBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a95d93c18b01648b64e89c5d4e0accd7c1af2c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,149,217,60,24,176,22,72,182,78,137,197,212,224,172,205,124,26,242,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
