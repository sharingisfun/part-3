The original game was published in 1983 and new games have been published at irregular intervals ever since. Several titles in the 2000s were published by fellow Japanese game company Konami, who gained full control of the franchise when they purchased and absorbed Hudson in 2012. Today, the commercially successful Bomberman has featured in over 70 different games, as well as several anime and manga.\n\nBomberman:\nGenre: Action\nDeveloper: Hudson Soft\nPublisher: Hudson Soft/Konami\nRelease Date: 1983\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n1- Mount the image.\n2- Install.\n3- Copy crack from the Crack folder over original files.\n4- Play.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586294caeba191e73f692b7f209042456ccde502","amp;dn":"Bomberman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586294caeba191e73f692b7f209042456ccde502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,98,148,202,235,161,145,231,63,105,43,127,32,144,66,69,108,205,229,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
