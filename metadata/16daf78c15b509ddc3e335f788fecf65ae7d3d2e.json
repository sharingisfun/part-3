In the 50's came Rock n' Roll, followed by the Beatles inspired 60's and just as revolutionary came the Punk/New Wave era of the 70's.\n\nThis collection is a tribute to the talents of the bands that made enormous contributions to that punk rock explosion.\n\nIt features some of the biggest names of that era from the brilliant Jam, to the Boomtown Rats led by Bob Geldof. The Sham 69 sang from their base in Hersham, England &quot;If the kids are united, they will never be defeated&quot; whilst from Manchester The Buzzcocks produced some of the best songs of the era. Northern Island did not miss out with Feargal Sharkey leading the Undertones in a breathless barrage of tunes of enthusiastic energy.\n\nAlthough they each came from diverse backgrounds they were driven by a common cause, to establish through their music a new order where there would be: no more prejudices; no more injustice; no more poseurs; No More Heroes...\n\nFormat: Flac EAC rip\n\nGenre: Punk Rock\n\n\n\n1.
