Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular biologistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s precision, a historianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective, and a biographerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived withÃ¢â‚¬â€and perished fromÃ¢â‚¬â€for more than five thousand years.\n \n \n \n \nThe story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out Ã¢â‚¬Å“war against cancer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec1cc6ca7df4e8d7375ac51844ef9df56268a4de","amp;dn":"%5BPulitzer%5D+The+Emperor+of+All+Maladies+-+A+Biography+of+Cancer+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec1cc6ca7df4e8d7375ac51844ef9df56268a4de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,28,198,202,125,244,232,215,55,90,197,24,68,239,157,245,98,104,164,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
