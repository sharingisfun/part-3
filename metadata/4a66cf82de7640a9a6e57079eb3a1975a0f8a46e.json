These 62 episodes were supposedly hand picked by the cast as their favorites of all time. The first ten volumes had brief interview segments with Burnett, Korman, and Conway before and after each episode.\r\n\r\nThe original uploader of these discs had defective discs 3,6,8,26 that could not be used. Therefore, only 27 of the 31 discs sold to the public, are available here.\r\n\r\nI have made several corrections to the episode list which was in the previous torrent that I am replacing with this one.\r\n\r\nInvader97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a66cf82de7640a9a6e57079eb3a1975a0f8a46e","amp;dn":"Carol+Burnett+Show+Collector%27s+Edition+%2827+of+31+Discs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a66cf82de7640a9a6e57079eb3a1975a0f8a46e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,102,207,130,222,118,64,169,166,229,112,121,235,58,25,117,160,248,164,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
