Exceptionally beautiful, Tess is given a place with her supposed noble kinsmen and is seduced and raped by the son of the family, Alec D'Urberville.\n\nShe returns home and gives birth to a sickly boy who soon dies. Trying to rebuild her life, Tess is employed as a milkmaid and meets Angel Clare. They fall in love and Angel proposes. \n\nScared of losing him, she can't face telling him about her past, but on their wedding night Angel confesses a previous affair, so Tess, convinced that he will now forgive her, owns up about her own relationship with Alec - with tragic consequences.\n\n\nCast:\n\nTherese (Tess) Durbeyfield : Justine Waddell \nAlec D'Urberville : Jason Flemyng \nAngel Clare : Oliver Milburn \nJack Durbeyfield : John McEnery \nJoan Durbeyfield : Lesley Dunlop \nMrs D'Urberville : Rosalind Knight \nCrick : Anthony O'Donnell \nMrs Crick : Christine Moore \nKail : Bryan Pringle \nMarian : Debbie Chazen\nIzzy : Candida Rundle \nRetty : Amanda Brewster \nCar Darch : Linda Armstrong \nNancy : Hannah Waterman \nCissie : Charlotte Bellamy.\n\n\nRunning Time: Approx. 3 hours.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ad1a00abcb647067f5ab4b37e82a45ae9b14a8","amp;dn":"Thomas+Hardy+-+Tess+of+the+D%5C%27Urbervilles+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ad1a00abcb647067f5ab4b37e82a45ae9b14a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,173,26,0,171,203,100,112,103,245,171,75,55,232,42,69,174,155,20,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
