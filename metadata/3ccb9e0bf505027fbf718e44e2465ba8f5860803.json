The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Flea (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith; and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late-2009, replacing John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time with over 80 million records sold worldwide, have been nominated for sixteen Grammy Awards, of which they have won six and are the most successful band in alternative rock radio history.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2016\r\nStyle:\tAlternative\r\nAdditional:\tRock\r\nCountry:\tUSA\r\nFormat:\tVBR mp3\r\nSize:\t100.07 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t15/06/2016 \r\n\r\nFiles:\t14\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength : 0:53:30\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n01.
