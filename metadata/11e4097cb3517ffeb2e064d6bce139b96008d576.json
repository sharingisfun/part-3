R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier, less complex children's fantasy novel The Hobbit (1937), but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during the Second World War. It is the second best selling novel ever written with over 150 million copies sold.\n\nThe Hobbit\nThe Fellowship of the Ring\nThe Two Towers\nThe Return of the King\n\nAll files in Kindle (.mobi) format.\n\nPlease comment, seed and check out my other torrents!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11e4097cb3517ffeb2e064d6bce139b96008d576","amp;dn":"The+Lord+of+the+Rings+-+%09J.+R.+R.+Tolkien+%28Hobbit%29%2B1-3+%28KINDLE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11e4097cb3517ffeb2e064d6bce139b96008d576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,228,9,124,179,81,127,254,178,224,100,214,188,225,57,185,96,8,213,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
