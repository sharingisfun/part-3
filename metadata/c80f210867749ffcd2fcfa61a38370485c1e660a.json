This book also helps solve a decoratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest challenges, from working around a home's existing architecture and organizing a space, to mixing patterns and editing collections. \n\nBest of all, 150 color photographs and charming watercolor illustrations--and even a bookplate for personalizing this guide--provide inspiration that makes this book as useful as it is beautiful.\n\nAmong the insider tips is information on:\n\n-Finding a dedicated space where you can organize paint samples, fabric swatches, and magazine clippings\n\n-Choosing a sofa wisely\n\n-Determining appropriate wall finishes and textures\n\n-Identifying what fabrics are right for you\n\n-Styling your decor to reinvigorate your space\n\n-Plus, the best suppliers for rugs, linens, accessories, and more\n\n\n&quot;Interior design should be about telling a personal story, and Shannon Fricke has nailed it on the head with How to Decorate.
