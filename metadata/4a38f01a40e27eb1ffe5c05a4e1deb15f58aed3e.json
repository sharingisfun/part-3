The author concentrates the revised edition on protected-mode Pentium programming, MIPS assembly language programming, and use of the NASM and SPIM assemblers for a Linux orientation. The focus is on providing students with a firm grasp of the main features of assembly programming, and how it can be used to improve a computer's performance. All of the main features are covered in depth, and the book is equally viable for DOS or Linux, MIPS (RISC) or CISC (Pentium). The book is based on a successful course given by the author and includes numerous hands-on exercises.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a38f01a40e27eb1ffe5c05a4e1deb15f58aed3e","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Assembly+Language+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a38f01a40e27eb1ffe5c05a4e1deb15f58aed3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,56,240,26,64,226,126,177,255,229,192,90,78,29,235,21,245,138,237,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
