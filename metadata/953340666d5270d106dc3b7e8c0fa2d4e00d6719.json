Driven by an absorbing and original written by renowned writers Bradley Thompson and David Weddle, Aliens History: Colonial Marines maintains the appearance and atmosphere of the original films while leveraging next-generation technology to create a whole new interactive experience based in the ALIENS universe. Developed by the studio Gearbox Software, amazing graphics and action game, full of adrenaline, I will lead to new game modes-individual, cooperative and competitive, incredibly immersive. To ensure an innovative asymmetrical multiplayer experience, Aliens: Colonial Marines lets players fight in first person as the toughest fighters (the U.S. Colonial Marines) or third person as the deadliest murderers of the universe, the Xenomorphs. By going to the family and new scenarios from the famous film franchise, players will have to fight the fear and face the true horrors of the ALIENS universe. Aliens: Colonial Marines begins with an ostensibly abandoned ship, the USS Sulaco, which is recovered orbiting LV-426. The player will lead a group of seasoned U.S. Colonial Marines to be addressed by the deserted craft to uncover the fate of the crew. They will have to fight to survive unspeakable horrors and their own anxieties as they pursue the truth behind a galaxy-spanning conspiracy that places humanity at the mercy of the most murderous and deadly species in the universe. Aliens: Colonial Marines features authentic sets, as the surface of LV-426 and Hadley's Hope, weapons inspired by the film series and is designed to provide an exhilarating and engaging new chapter in the world of ALIENS\n\nPlatform: PC\nSize: 11.79 GB\nDate: 09/01/2014\nRelease: PROPHET\n\n________________$$$$\n______________$$____$$\n______________$$____$$\n______________$$____$$\n______________$$____$$\n______________$$____$$\n__________$$$$$$____$$$$$$\n________$$____$$____$$____$$$$\n________$$____$$____$$____$$__$$\n$$$$$$__$$____$$____$$____$$____$$\n$$____$$$$________________$$____$$\n$$______$$______________________$$\n__$$____$$______________________$$\n___$$$__$$______________________$$\n____$$__________________________$$\n_____$$$________________________$$\n______$$______________________$$$\n_______$$$____________________$$\n________$$____________________$$\n_________$$$________________$$$\n__________$$________________$$\n__________$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:953340666d5270d106dc3b7e8c0fa2d4e00d6719","amp;dn":"Aliens+Colonial+Marines+Collectors+Edition+%5BMULTI6%5D+%5BPROPHET%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"953340666d5270d106dc3b7e8c0fa2d4e00d6719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,51,64,102,109,82,112,209,6,220,59,126,140,15,162,212,224,13,103,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
