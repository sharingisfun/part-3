But everything changed when the folks at Ghostly International heard the project and inked a deal with the producer. He added some bonus material to the EP and re-released it on the label. Truise then began crafting his proper debut full-length, Galactic Melt, an apt title for a record filled with space-y synthesizers, glitchy noises, and \\'80s-esque percussion.\n\n  Andrew Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e033200628a1d0dad48da0f2a4edbc48cde4b49f","amp;dn":"Com+Truise+-+2011+-+Galactic+Melt+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e033200628a1d0dad48da0f2a4edbc48cde4b49f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,51,32,6,40,161,208,218,212,141,160,242,164,237,188,72,205,228,180,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
