One of the best GA single-prop\n\naircraft out for P3D in my opinion. \n\nCorrect me if i'm wrong but it doesn't need the A2A accusim core update for it to \n\nrun. If it dose you can find it on A2A simulations website.\n\n\n\n\nOf course feel free to comment if you have any questions or problems.\n\nIf you like this software please consider buying it !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f01aa9bbbaa9899233be510ba92ddf87555ecc45","amp;dn":"%5BP3D%5D+A2A+Cessna+182+-+%5BRequested%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f01aa9bbbaa9899233be510ba92ddf87555ecc45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,26,169,187,186,169,137,146,51,190,81,11,169,45,223,135,85,94,204,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
