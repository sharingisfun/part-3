Supertramp Live in Paris is a superb concert film, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/singer/keyboard player/songwriter Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes an extremely important live document of the classic lineup of the band, indeed. This concert film had been fabled for years and no footage had been officially released (aside &quot;The Logical Song&quot; and &quot;Dreamer&quot; as promo films) it wasn't until the master tapes of the December 1, 1979 performance were discovered in drummer Bob Siebenberg's barn in cow dung. Then longtime producer Peter Henderson and old concert sound engineer Russell Pope (whom produced the original album) painstakingly restored and transferred the audio from analog to digital and brilliantly mixed the audio. Then Peter Clifton (the same man who finished Led Zeppelin's The Song Remains the Same after Joe Massot bailed) salvaged the footage shot by Derek Burbidge (who filmed much of The Police's promo videos in the day) and added some bits to round out the film. What is available is a superb document of the classic Supertramp lineup.\nMany great Supertramp classics are included in this live concert film, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century (the spirited opener &quot;School&quot;, a slightly extended &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, an excellent &quot;Hide in Your Shell&quot;, a superb &quot;Asylum', the Top 20 hit &quot;Dreamer&quot;, a superb &quot;Rudy&quot; and the closing &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; which closes this live concert film), two songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (&quot;Another Man's Woman&quot; and &quot;Two of Us&quot; both superior to studio versions), three from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments (the title cut, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; and the best version of &quot;Fool's Overture&quot; ever which has an ending that is to be seen to believe), and half of the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America (the monster hit &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, the hit &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;, the title cut, the Top 20 smash &quot;Take The Long Way Home&quot; and the epic closer &quot;Child of Vision&quot;).\nHodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/singer/songwriter Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards and additional backing vocals, drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is sped at faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section and the visuals of the backdrop films are superb.\nThe songs that weren't shot for the film which were recorded (&quot;Ain't Nobody But Me&quot;, &quot;You Started Laughing&quot;, &quot;Downstream&quot;, &quot;A Soapbox Opera&quot; and &quot;From Now On&quot;) are here as bonus tracks with visuals created specifically for the DVD/Blu-Ray.\nAlso, much to Roger Hodgson's chagrin, the songwriting credits are printed on the back of the Blu-Ray (may not have been there on the first issue) and the Supertramp fans are just grateful that this classic document of the band's peak is FINALLY AVAILABLE!!!\nHighly recommended!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6be3724181c91917f5d536d43330ba690172ea","amp;dn":"SUPERTRAMP+LIVE+IN+PARIS+79+1080p+Blu-ray+DTS%2BLPCM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b6be3724181c91917f5d536d43330ba690172ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,107,227,114,65,129,201,25,23,245,213,54,212,51,48,186,105,1,114,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
