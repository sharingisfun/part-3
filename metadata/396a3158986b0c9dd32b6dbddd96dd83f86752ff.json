Dick\nNarrated by George Guidall\n-A Hugo Award Winner\n\nIn his critically-acclaimed science fic-\ntion novel, Philip K. Dick creates a shock-\ning vision of the United States of the 60s\nthat stands in direct opposition to \nhistory's\nrecords of that uninhibited decade. The\nAxis have won World War II, Japan and\nGermany occupy America, Nazi rockets\nrule the skies, and slaves again are forced to\nserve harsh masters.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:396a3158986b0c9dd32b6dbddd96dd83f86752ff","amp;dn":"Philip+K+Dick+-+The+Man+in+the+High+Castle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"396a3158986b0c9dd32b6dbddd96dd83f86752ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,106,49,88,152,107,12,157,211,43,109,189,221,150,221,131,248,103,82,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
