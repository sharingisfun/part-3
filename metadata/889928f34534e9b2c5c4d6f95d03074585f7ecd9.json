Edited by Katherine Howe.  320 pp. -- ePUB + MOBI\n\n\nFrom a manual for witch hunters written by King James himself in 1597, to court documents from the Salem witch trials of 1692, to newspaper coverage of a woman stoned to death on the streets of Philadelphia while the Continental Congress met, THE PENGUIN BOOK OF WITCHES is a treasury of historical accounts of accused witches that sheds light on the reality behind the legends.\n\nBringing to life stories like that of Eunice Cole, tried for attacking a teenage girl with a rock and buried with a stake through her heart; Jane Jacobs, a Bostonian so often accused of witchcraft that she took her tormentors to court on charges of slander; and Increase Mather, an exorcism-performing minister famed for his knowledge of witches, this volume provides a unique tour through the darkest history of English and North American witchcraft.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;This comprehensive collection of carefully selected documents and published primary materials, coupled with judicious and informative introductions, will help modern readers understand the seemingly inexplicable and persistent popular phenomenon of belief in witchcraft from the seventeenth century into more modern times.&quot; -- Mary Beth Norton\n\n&quot;Fascinating and insightful.  With her usual skill, Katherine Howe navigates the winding path leading to SalemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hysteria and beyond.  A must-read for anyone who wants to know not only what happened but also how and why.&quot; -- Brunonia Barry\n\n&quot;An informative and engaging series of texts that Katherine Howe introduces in a crisp and well-informed manner.  The chronological breadth is unusual, but it allows us to grasp more fully the continuities that mark the history of witch-hunting on both sides of the Atlantic.&quot; -- David D. Hall\n\n&quot;With insightful notations . . . this superbly edited and annotated work provides in-depth material for those interested in the origins of witchcraft persecution in America.&quot; -- Library Journal\n\n&quot;I am just glad there is now, in this world, a book with the title The Penguin Book of Witches, because, really, how cool is that.&quot; -- John Scalzi\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
