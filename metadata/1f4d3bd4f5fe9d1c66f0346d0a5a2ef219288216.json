The good doctor is the inventor of the celebrated &quot;screw-top&quot; method of brain surgery, in which the top of the skull twists off as easily as the lid of a pickle jar. The man may be a medical genius, but his talent for love leaves something to be desired. On a trip to Vienna to attend a medical conference Hfuhruhurr falls in love with a bottled brain (voiced by Sissy Spacek) owned by a mad scientist and finds himself in the middle of murders committed by the elevator killer.\n\n  Starring: Steve Martin, Kathleen Turner, David Warner, Paul Benedict, Richard Brestoff.\n\n  Directed by: Carl Reiner.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 30min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 640 x 480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f4d3bd4f5fe9d1c66f0346d0a5a2ef219288216","amp;dn":"The+Man+With+Two+Brains+%281983%29+%28Steve+Martin%2C+Kathleen+Turner%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f4d3bd4f5fe9d1c66f0346d0a5a2ef219288216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,77,59,212,245,254,157,28,102,240,52,109,10,90,46,242,25,40,130,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
