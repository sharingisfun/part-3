Alan S. Miller and Satoshi Kanazawa re-examine some of the most popular and controversial topics of modern life-and shed a whole new light on why we do the things we do. \n\n Reader beware: You may never look at human nature the same way again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62abf5b58bf49ecbf47fad8759367c0f7b0801fd","amp;dn":"Why+Beautiful+People+Have+More+Daughters+%282007%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62abf5b58bf49ecbf47fad8759367c0f7b0801fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,171,245,181,139,244,158,203,244,127,173,135,89,54,124,15,123,8,1,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
