Clocking in at over 3 1/2 hours, the movie focuses less on plot than on the confused and ambivalent interrelations of these three lost souls. As such, it becomes a searing document of the aftermath of Paris&amp;#039;s social and sexual revolutions of the Sixties, particularly the uprisings of May 1968. These characters know that they are supposed to be free and liberated, but they don&amp;#039;t quite know how to go about it, or how to make it work in practice, and their efforts don&amp;#039;t seem to make them any happier. In the guise of a plotless style seemingly borrowed from cinÃƒÂ©ma vÃƒÂ©ritÃƒÂ© documentaries, Eustache unfolds a critique of both the illusory liberations of his social moment and the dead-end heritage of his cinematic moment. By casting Jean-Pierre LÃƒÂ©aud, an icon of the French New Wave who first made his name as the star of FranÃƒÂ§ois Truffaut&amp;#039;s pioneering The 400 Blows (1959), Eustache sets out to rewrite the conventions of a French New Wave that had changed from a revolutionary film movement into a formulaic mainstream style. Despite its deceptively rambling manner, the film effortlessly intertwines its characters&amp;#039; psychological dilemmas with a portrait of its cultural moment with a revision of a wide swath of film history from Truffaut&amp;#039;s Jules and Jim to Jean Renoir&amp;#039;s Rules of the Game to Ernst Lubitsch&amp;#039;s Design for Living. This experimental classic is not for all viewers, but it&amp;#039;s an unforgettable, and historically indispensable, experience for those who can stick with it.\n\n\n\nHardsubbed VHS rip (Quality is Ok)\n\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
