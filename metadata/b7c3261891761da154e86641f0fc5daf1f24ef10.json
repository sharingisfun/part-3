He became known globally after the 1964 release of the Michael Cacoyannis film Zorba the Greek, based on the novel. He gained renewed fame with the 1988 Martin Scorsese adaptation of his book The Last Temptation of Christ.\n\nThe author of Zorba the Greek perhaps was meant to launch his professional life as a lawyer, and not as author or journalist. This was certainly his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aspiration for him. Nikos was to excel in his legal studies, and then pursue a career in the turbulent world of Greek politics. Kapetan Michalis, the man with the leonine eyes and the heavy heart, who had vowed to never smile or laugh until his homeland was free from the Ottoman yoke, had great expectations of his sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocation, demanding from him no less than the very liberation of Crete. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that means useful to your homeland. Too bad you were born for studies and not for arms, but unfortunately there's nothing to be done about it. That's your road; follow it. Understand? Educate yourself in order to help Crete gain her freedom. Let that be your goal. Otherwise, to the devil with education! I don't want you to become a teacher, monk, or a wise Solomon. Get that clear! I've made up my mind, now you make up yours. If you can't help Crete either through arms or letters, you'd do better to lie down and die.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Report to Greco, p. 95)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format unless otherwise stated:\n\n* Freedom or Death\n\n* Friedrich Nietzsche on the Philosophy of Right And the State -- PDF\n\n* Saint Francis\n\n* The Fratricides\n\n* The Last Temptation of Christ\n\n* The Odyssey - A Modern Sequel\n\n* Zorba the Greek -- PDF + ePUB\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Kazantzakis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Kazantzakis&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/14/zorba-greek-nikos-kazantzakis-summer-readings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/14/zorba-greek-nikos-kazantzakis-summer-readings&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kazantzakispublications.org/en/kazantzakis.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kazantzakispublications.org/en/kazantzakis.php&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fresques.ina.fr/europe-des-cultures-en/fiche-media/Europe00005/nikos-kazantzakis-regarding-zorba-the-greek-and-st-francis-of-assisi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fresques.ina.fr/europe-des-cultures-en/fiche-media/Europe00005/nikos-kazantzakis-regarding-zorba-the-greek-and-st-francis-of-assisi.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7c3261891761da154e86641f0fc5daf1f24ef10","amp;dn":"Nikos+Kazantzakis+-+Greek+Writer+%26amp%3B+Philosopher+%287+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7c3261891761da154e86641f0fc5daf1f24ef10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,195,38,24,145,118,29,161,84,232,102,65,240,252,93,175,31,36,239,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
