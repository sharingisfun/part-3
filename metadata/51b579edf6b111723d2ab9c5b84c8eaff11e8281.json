Drawing on the latest research findings from the disciplines of neuropsychology, neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience and cognitive neuropsychology, the author provides contemporary models of neuropsychological processes. The book provides a fresh perspective that takes into account the modern advances of functional neuroimaging and other new research techniques.\nThe emphasis at all times is on bridging the gap between theory and practice - discussion of theoretical models is framed in a clinical context and the author makes frequent use of case studies to illustrate the clinical context. There is coverage of the neuropsychology of disorders associated with areas such as perception, attention, memory and language, emotion, and movement. A third-generation text, this book uniquely aims to integrate these different areas by describing the common influences of these functions. Following on from this there is information on the clinical management of patients in the area of recovery and rehabilitation. These last chapters focus on the author's own experience and illustrate the importance of a more systematic approach to intervention, which takes into account theoretical views of recovery from brain damage.\nNeuropsychology: From Theory to Practice is the first comprehensive textbook to cover research from all disciplines committed to understanding neuropsychology. It will provide a valuable resource for students, professionals and clinicians.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b579edf6b111723d2ab9c5b84c8eaff11e8281","amp;dn":"Neuropsychology%2C+From+Theory+to+Practice+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b579edf6b111723d2ab9c5b84c8eaff11e8281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,181,121,237,246,177,17,114,61,42,185,197,184,76,142,175,241,30,130,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
