YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn through code examples, exercises, and fluid explanations how these anonymous functions will help you write simple, clean, library-level code that solves business problems.\n\nLambda expressions are a fairly simple change to Java, and the first part of the book shows you how to use them properly. Later chapters show you how lambda functions help you improve performance with parallelism, write simpler concurrent code, and model your domain more accurately, including building better DSLs.\n\nUse exercises in each chapter to help you master lambda expressions in Java 8 quickly\nExplore streams, advanced collections, and other Java 8 library improvements\nLeverage multicore CPUs and improve performance with data parallelism\nUse techniques to Ã¢â‚¬Å“lambdifyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ your existing codebase or library code\nLearn practical solutions for lambda expression unit testing and debugging\nImplement SOLID principles of object-oriented programming with lambdas\nWrite concurrent applications that efficiently perform message passing and non-blocking I/O","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49ea8e311f0297d2ae3fc1707434f562ed7c0a31","amp;dn":"Java+8+Lambdas+-+Pragmatic+Functional+Programming+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49ea8e311f0297d2ae3fc1707434f562ed7c0a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,234,142,49,31,2,151,210,174,63,193,112,116,52,245,98,237,124,10,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
