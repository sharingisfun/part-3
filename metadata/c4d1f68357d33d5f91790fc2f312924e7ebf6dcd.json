Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler, who is referred to and also refers to himself as &quot;The Dude&quot;.\nThe Dude is introduced to a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski after a case of mistaken identity. When the millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is later kidnapped, he commissions the Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the full ransom. Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, Julianne Moore, Tara Reid and John Turturro star in the film, which is narrated by a cowboy known only as &quot;Stranger,&quot; played by Sam Elliott. The film's structure has been compared to Raymond Chandler's novel The Big Sleep.\nThe original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen Brothers.\nThe movie was not an immediate commercial success (its budget was about US$15 million, and the film grossed US$17 million in the United States), but it received generally positive reviews from critics. The film, noted for its idiosyncratic characters, surreal dream sequences, unconventional dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack, has become a cult favorite and has been called &quot;the first cult film of the Internet era.\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL DATA:\n\n\n\nFile Size: 8111 MB\nRuntime: 01h 52m\nVideo Codec: X264\nVideo Bitrate: 9442 Kbps\nResolution: 1980 x 1040\nFPS (Frames/sec): 25.000\nQF (Frame quality): 0.189\n\nAudio Codec: AC3\nBitrate: 320 Kbps CBR 2 chnls\nFreq Audio: 48000 Hz\nLanguage: Italian; English\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i531.photobucket.com/albums/dd358/ShivaShanti75/Lebo5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4d1f68357d33d5f91790fc2f312924e7ebf6dcd","amp;dn":"The+Big+Lebowski+-+Il+Grande+Lebowski+%28BDrip+ITA-ENG+1080p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4d1f68357d33d5f91790fc2f312924e7ebf6dcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,209,246,131,87,211,61,95,145,121,15,194,243,18,146,78,126,191,109,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
