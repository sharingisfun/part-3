Entombed began their career as an early pioneer of Scandinavian death metal which initially differed from its American counterpart by its distinct guitar tone. However, by the early 1990s their sound had broadened to include garage rock and other influences. This new style would eventually be described as death 'n' roll. Entombed have been influenced by bands such as Slayer, Autopsy, Kiss, The Misfits, MotÃƒÂ¶rhead and Discharge.\n\nYear: 1990 - 2012\nCountry: Sweden\nGenre: Death Metal/Death 'n' Roll\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 320kbps\n\n\nEntombed_-_(1990) Left Hand Path\nEntombed_-_(1991) Clandestine\nEntombed_-_(1993) Wolverine Blues\nEntombed_-_(1997) To Ride, Shoot Straight And Speak The Truth\nEntombed_-_(1998) Same Difference\nEntombed_-_(2000) Uprising\nEntombed_-_(2001) Morning Star\nEntombed_-_(2003) Inferno\nEntombed_-_(2007) Serpent Saints - The Ten Amendments\nEntombed_-_(2012)When in Sodom Revisited [Single]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34dbe97719351400d6017ee224fbf4a5737042d8","amp;dn":"Entombed+-+discography+%5BMetal%5D+%281990+-+2012%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34dbe97719351400d6017ee224fbf4a5737042d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,219,233,119,25,53,20,0,214,1,126,226,36,251,244,165,115,112,66,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
