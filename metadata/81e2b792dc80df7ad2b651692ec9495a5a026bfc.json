Love\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies, &quot;The Caution Horses&quot; is a very good, but not fully realized cd. As other reviewers have noted there are a couple of regrettable spots where the lyrics are overwrought and sophmoric. But it is all forgivable in that it is necessary to produce the rest of what is here, which could several times risk being both overwrought and sophmoric, yet rises above and become magnficent. Margo Timmins is vulnerable and lovely and hits all the notes along the way. Two things that must be mentioned. First, Caution Horses is one of the alltime great album titles, but you don't need to buy it to enjoy that. Why you do need to buy it, if you are on the fence is...&quot;Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning&quot; is one of the best songs you will ever listen to ever. Really. It's that good. If the rest of the album featured me playing Mary Had A Little Lamb, it'd still be worth it. And, great news, they didn't put me on there, just some other pretty good Cowboy Junkies songs. Remember. &quot;Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning&quot;.
