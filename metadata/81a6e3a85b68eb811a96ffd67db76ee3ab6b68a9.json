How to build a brain provides a detailed guided exploration of a new cognitive architecture that takes biological detail seriously, while addressing cognitive phenomena. \n\nAlong the way, the book considers neural coding, concept representation, neural dynamics, working memory, neuroanatomy, reinforcement learning, and spike-timing dependent plasticity. The book includes 8 detailed, hands-on tutorials exploiting the free Nengo neural simulation environment, providing practical experience with the concepts and models presented throughout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81a6e3a85b68eb811a96ffd67db76ee3ab6b68a9","amp;dn":"How+to+Build+a+Brain+%282013%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81a6e3a85b68eb811a96ffd67db76ee3ab6b68a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,166,227,168,91,104,235,129,26,150,255,214,125,183,110,227,171,107,104,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
