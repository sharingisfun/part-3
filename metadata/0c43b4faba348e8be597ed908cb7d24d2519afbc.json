She sings mostly in English but developed her career singing in English and Japanese. In addition, she has released rare tracks, recorded in Mandarin, which can be found on limited edition albums.\n\nLikened to Seiko Matsuda, she won a singing contest and was signed to a Japanese recording company S2S Pte Ltd at the age of 15.\n\nAfter taking her O-level examinations in Singapore, Ong moved to Japan to further her studies as well as her career as a solo artist. In Singapore, Ong, along with 2 other Singaporean girls formed the Japanese pop (J-pop) group , Mirai. Their first single, &quot;Open Up Your Mind&quot;, was one of the theme songs in the Japanese anime Gensoumaden Saiyuki.\n\nShe released her bestselling dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©but, A Girl Meets Bossa Nova at only 19. With her sultry, soulful, pristine and innocent vocals, she reinterprets Frank Sinatra's hits such as &quot;Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars&quot;, among other jazz and pop numbers. She is one of the new wave of Singaporean talent being exported internationally. So far, Ong is the only pop sensation exported exclusively to Japan; previous stars such as Mavis Hee, Kit Chan, Tanya Chua, Joi Chua, Stefanie Sun, Michelle Saram etc., have been promoted mainly in the Greater Chinese market.\n\nIn 2009 Ong was signed to Taiwanese record company HIM Music and became a big hit back in Singapore after she sang the theme song of the peranakan-themed drama serial, The Little Nyonya. She has stated that her paternal grandfather is Peranakan.\n\nHer first record under HIM Music was released on 5 March 2010, entitled Olivia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c43b4faba348e8be597ed908cb7d24d2519afbc","amp;dn":"Olivia+Ong+-+Sweet+Memories+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c43b4faba348e8be597ed908cb7d24d2519afbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,67,180,250,186,52,142,139,229,151,237,144,140,183,210,77,37,25,175,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
