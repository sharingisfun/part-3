Berresford, Andrew M. Rockett \n\n\n# Publisher: Cengage Learning\n# Edition: 6\n# ISBN-13: 978-1133103929\n# Pages : 672 pages\n\n\nThis text uses intriguing real-world applications to engage readers' interest and show them the practical side of calculus.\n\nThe book's many applications are related to finance, business, and such general-interest topics as learning curves in airplane production, the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Apple and Oracle stock prices, the distance traveled by sports cars, lives saved by seat belts, and the cost of a congressional victory.\n\nThe Sixth Edition maintains the hallmark features that have made APPLIED CALCULUS, BRIEF so popular: contemporary and interesting applications; careful and effective use of technology, including graphing calculator and spreadsheet coverage; constant pedagogical reinforcement through section summaries, chapter summaries, annotated examples, and extra practice problems; Just-in-Time algebra review material; and a variety of exercises that allow readers to practice and hone their problem-solving skills.\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nDr. Berresford received his Ph.D. from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University and taught at the State University of New York at Purchase before joining the faculty at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University. Besides co-authoring four textbooks with Dr. Rockett, he has published papers in differential equations, linear programming, logic, and probability, and has recieved several teaching awards and the Distinguished Service Award from The Metropolitan New York Section of the Mathematical Association of America.\n\nAfter completing his Ph.D. at Stony Brook University, Dr. Rockett joined the mathematics faculty at C.W. Post and began his collaborations with Dr. Berresford. His book with Peter Szusz on &quot;Continued Fractions&quot; (1992) was hailed by Ivan Niven as &quot;an outstanding addition to the literature of mathematics,&quot; and he served the Kappa Mu Epsilon mathematics honor society as editor of the mathematics journal &quot;The Pentagon&quot; from 1989 to 1995. Dr. Rockett serves as a reviewer for several journals including Mathematical Reviews for the American Mathematical Society. \n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a27d203a5debae532a31932380d0231fa398760","amp;dn":"Brief+Applied+Calculus+-+Geoffrey+C.+Berresford+%286e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a27d203a5debae532a31932380d0231fa398760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,39,210,3,165,222,186,229,50,163,25,50,56,13,2,49,250,57,135,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
