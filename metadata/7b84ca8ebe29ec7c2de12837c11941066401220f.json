Luckily, the trio seems enamored by most of the same songs that the general public is, resulting in one of those rare Ã¢â‚¬Å“greatest-hitsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ collections that goes deep without depriving the listener of the essentials. With tunes like &quot;Orinoco Flow,&quot; &quot;Caribbean Blue,&quot; and &quot;Book of Days&quot; in the pot and out of the way, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easier to appreciate hidden gems like &quot;Cursum Perficio,&quot; &quot;Boadicea,&quot; &quot;Trains and Winter Rains,&quot; and &quot;Anywhere Is.&quot; Also notable is the inclusion of &quot;May It Be&quot; and a previously unreleased version of &quot;AnÃƒÂ­ron (I Desire),&quot; both of which originally appeared on the soundtrack for the first chapter of Peter JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy.
