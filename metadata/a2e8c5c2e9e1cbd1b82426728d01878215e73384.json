Their sound was characterised by a hybrid of blues rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock,[1] combining the psychedelia-themed lyrics, Eric Clapton's blues guitar playing, Jack Bruce's voice and prominent bass playing and Ginger Baker's jazz-influenced drumming. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire, was the world's first platinum-selling double album.[2][3] Cream are widely regarded as being the world's first successful supergroup.[4][5][6][7] In their career, they sold over 15 million albums worldwide.[8]\n\nCream's music included songs based on traditional blues such as &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;Spoonful&quot;, and modern blues such as &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;, as well as more eccentric songs such as &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Toad&quot;. Cream's biggest hits were &quot;I Feel Free&quot; (UK, #11),[3] &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; (US, #5),[9] &quot;White Room&quot; (US, #6),[9] &quot;Crossroads&quot; (US, #28),[9] and &quot;Badge&quot; (UK, #18).[10]\n\nCream made a significant impact upon the popular music of the time, and, along with Jimi Hendrix, they popularised the use of the wah-wah pedal. They provided a heavy yet technically proficient musical theme that foreshadowed and influenced the emergence of British bands such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and The Jeff Beck Group in the late 1960s. The band's live performances influenced progressive rock acts such as Rush,[11] jam bands such as The Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead, Phish and heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.[12]\n\nCream was ranked #16 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Rolling Stone named them the sixty-sixth greatest artist of all time.[13] In 2010 VH1 also ranked them #61 on their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Very Best Of Cream 1995\n\n\nThe Very Best of Cream is a 1995 Cream compilation album.
