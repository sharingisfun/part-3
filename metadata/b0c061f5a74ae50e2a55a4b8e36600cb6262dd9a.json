He knows he's a thug. He has no problem with that realization. In his view the galaxy has given him a gift: a mutation that allows him to withstand great deals of physical trauma. He puts his abilities to the best use possible and that isn't by being a scientist.\r\n\r\nBesides, the space station Belvaille doesn't need scientists. It is not, generally, a thinking person's locale. It is the remotest habitation in the entire Colmarian Confederation. There is literally no reason to be there.\r\n\r\nUnless you are a criminal.\r\n\r\nBecause of its location, Belvaille is populated with nothing but crooks. Every day is a series of power struggles between the crime bosses.\r\n\r\nHank is an intrinsic part of this community as a premier gang negotiator. Not because he is eloquent or brilliant or an expert combatant, but because if you shoot him in the face he keeps on talking.\r\n\r\nHank believes he has it pretty good until a beautiful and mysterious blue woman enters his life with a compelling job offer.\r\n\r\nHank and Belvaille, so long out of public scrutiny, suddenly find themselves the epicenter of the galaxy with a lot of very unwelcome attention.\r\n\r\nRead by Liam Owen\r\nLength: 9 hrs and 20 mins\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:06-17-14\r\nPublisher: Steven Campbell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0c061f5a74ae50e2a55a4b8e36600cb6262dd9a","amp;dn":"Steven+Campbell+-+Screw+The+Galaxy+%28Hard+Luck+Hank+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0c061f5a74ae50e2a55a4b8e36600cb6262dd9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,192,97,245,167,74,229,14,42,85,164,184,227,102,0,203,98,98,221,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
