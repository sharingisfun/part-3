The Stray Cats were formed by guitarist/vocalist Brian Setzer in the Long Island town of Massapequa, NY, in 1979. At first, Setzer played rockabilly covers in a band called the Tom Cats with his drumming brother Gary and bassist Bob Beecher; however, Setzer soon abandoned that group to join up with newly rechristened school friends Lee Rocker (born Leon Drucker) and Slim Jim Phantom (born James McDonnell). However, their retro '50s look and sound didn't go over well around Long Island, and in the summer of 1980 the group headed to England, where a rockabilly revival movement was just beginning to emerge.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRockabilly\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Rock This Town\n02.Stray Cat Strut\n03.Rumble In Brighton\n04.Built For Speed\n05.Rev It Up And Go\n06.Runaway Boys\n07.(She's) Sexy + 17\n08.Look At That Cadillac\n09.I Won't Stand In Your Way\n10.18 Miles From Memphis\n11.Gene And Eddie\n12.Bring It Back Again\n13.Blast Off\n14.Race With The Devil\n15.Rumble In Brighton (Live)\n16.Stray Cat Strut (Live)\n17.Rock This Town (Live)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b57b4710791a6806061b61bdade2b8f5af70e0d","amp;dn":"Stray+Cats+-+Greatest+Hits+%282000%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b57b4710791a6806061b61bdade2b8f5af70e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,87,180,113,7,145,166,128,96,97,182,27,218,222,43,143,90,247,14,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
