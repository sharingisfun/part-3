Seemingly complex crocheting jargon and techniques are demystified with step-by-step photographs and instructions. Clear diagrams demonstrate how to hold a crochet hook and yarn, and form basic stitches to create a simple scarf. More advanced skills - such as shaping, working in rounds, motifs, and edging - lead into sophisticated projects, including an evening bag, a pillow, and an edged camisole. Designed for the extreme beginner, the manual also contains an index, a list of additional resources, and helpful charts.\n\nDescription from Crocheted Gifts: Irresistible Projects to Make and Give (INT):\nMake stylish crocheted gifts year-round with Crocheted Gifts, a collection of projects from today's most popular crochet designers. From baby gifts to mittens for the whole family, to home decor and fancy lace, this book is full of perfect projects for every occasion.\n\nThe first small project book to focus exclusively on crochet, Crocheted Gifts is the ultimate gift-giving guide resource for crocheters, full of various projects that crocheters will love to make and be proud to give away (if they can bear to part with them!).\n\nFeaturing 25 designs by various crochet stars such as Doris Chan, Kathy Merrick, Robyn Chachula, Annie Modesitt, and more, Crocheted Gifts includes innovative, unusual, and imaginative designs for all crochet tastes. Crocheted Gifts also includes stylish photography and step-by-step crochet instructions for every project, ranging from easy-to-crochet to more advanced techniques.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1731af8a77fca61ea33fbd29132ba777acbfb415","amp;dn":"Crochet+Book+Collection+%5BEpub%2C+PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1731af8a77fca61ea33fbd29132ba777acbfb415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,49,175,138,119,252,166,30,163,63,189,41,19,43,167,119,172,191,180,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
