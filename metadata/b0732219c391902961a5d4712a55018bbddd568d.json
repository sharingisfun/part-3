Muscle Man, an overweight and green man, and High-Five Ghost, a ghost with a hand extending from the top of his head, are both neutral about Rigby and Mordecai's shenanigans.[3] The episodes usually revolve around the two's personal life such as obtaining concert tickets, getting food, or making up for a mess they have caused, often leading to highly surreal and unusual events.\n\nUploaded for the convenience of others, They are all in AVI format\n\nEnjoy :))\nand remember: always practice common courtesy in torrenting and SEEEDDDDDD!!!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0732219c391902961a5d4712a55018bbddd568d","amp;dn":"Regular+Show+seasons+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0732219c391902961a5d4712a55018bbddd568d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,115,34,25,195,145,144,41,97,165,212,113,42,85,1,139,189,221,86,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
