The award cited MÃ¼ller for depicting &quot;the landscape of the dispossessed&quot; with &quot;the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose.&quot;\r\n\r\nMÃ¼ller is noted for her works depicting the effects of violence, cruelty and terror, usually in the setting of Communist Romania under the repressive Nicolae Ceausescu regime which she has experienced herself.  Her style has been described as &quot;lively, poetic, [and] corrosive.&quot;\r\n\r\nHer first book, a collection of short stories titled NADIRS (1982), was censored by the Romanian government, but she won a following in Germany when the complete version of the book was smuggled out of the country.  Told from the perspective of a young girl, with all her fantasies and fears, the book depicts the confinement, corruption, intolerance, and oppression of a Swabian village in the Banat.  THE PASSPORT (1986) is a beautiful, haunting novel whose subject is a German village in Romania caught between the stifling hopelessness of Ceausescu's dictatorship and the glittering temptations of the West.\r\n\r\nWhen MÃ¼ller openly criticized the communist dictatorship in the German media, she was prohibited from publishing and repeatedly summoned by the Securitate for interrogations, where she was confronted with absurd accusations, reviled as a prostitute, charged with black marketeering, and threatened with death.  She emigrated to Germany in 1987 and has lived in Berlin since.\r\n\r\nAlthough her circumstances had changed, her work continued to present and examine the formative experiences of her life: themes such as totalitarianism and exile pervade her work.  In TRAVELING ON ONE LEG (1989), she portrayed the difficulties of finding a foothold in strange surroundings.  Other novels followed about daily life in a dictatorship, difficult friendships, and the long arm of the secret police reaching into the private sphere, including THE FOX WAS EVER THE HUNTER (1992), a haunting depiction of surveillance, paranoia, and the corruption of the soul under totalitarianism; THE LAND OF GREEN PLUMS (1994), set in Romania at the height of Ceauescu's reign of terror, which received the 1998 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award; and THE APPOINTMENT (1997), a fierce novel about a young Romanian woman's discovery of betrayal in the most intimate reaches of her life.\r\n\r\nHer much acclaimed novel THE HUNGER ANGEL (2009) portrays the deportation of Romania's German minority to gulags during the Soviet occupation of Romania for use as German forced labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in ePUB/Mobi and/or PDF format as indicated:\r\n\r\n* Appointment, The (Picador, 2002).
