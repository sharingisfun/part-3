For good or bad I've have retained this experimental record exactly as it played.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.

Tracks A6 and B7 are untitled, hidden tracks printed on the A (Runs At 78 RPM) and B-side (Runs At 45 RPM) labels, respectively.\n\n2 vinyl-only hidden tracks hidden beneath the center labels.\n1 hidden track plays at 78 RPM, one plays at 45 RPM, making this a 3-speed record.\nSide A plays from the inside out.\nDual-groove technology: plays an electric or acoustic intro for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just One DrinkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ depending on where needle is dropped. The grooves meet for the body of the song.\nMatte finish on Side B, giving the appearance of an un-played 78 RPM record.\nBoth sides end with locked grooves.\nVinyl pressed in seldom-used flat-edged format.\nDead wax area on Side A contains a hand-etched hologram by Tristan Duke of Infinity Light Science, the first of its kind on a vinyl record.\nZero compression used in the mastering.\nThere is a different running order from the CD/digital version.\nThe LP utilizes some mixes different from those used on CD and digital version. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRIPPER NOTES.\n\nYes, this is a new rip. \n\nNO, this does not contain the two 30 - 40 second label tracks. Look, you want those you take your Ã‚Â£400 Cartridge\nand find out if the paper wreak's the stylus, frankly its an experiment I'm not willing to try. So, no whinging about it thank you.\n\nFinally, Enjoy Beolab.   \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e576f915fa28b1050cd713a3914ee2a8a3a1115f","amp;dn":"Jack+White+-+Lazaretto+%5BUltra+Vinyl%5D+%282014%29+Third+Man+Records+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e576f915fa28b1050cd713a3914ee2a8a3a1115f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,118,249,21,250,40,177,5,12,215,19,163,145,78,226,168,163,161,17,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
