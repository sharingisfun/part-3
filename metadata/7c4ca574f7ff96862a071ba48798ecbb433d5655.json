I did however try to clean this all up it seems everything was scattered all over the place... Hope this helps!\r\n\r\n\r\nQuickBooks Keys/Multi User Setup for all versions 2013 2014 2015 2016 v.16\r\n1.) Download QuickBooks version of your choice.\r\n2.) Before running install put you computer into airplane mode (OR Disable Internet connection on older machines)\r\n3.) Install QuickBooks - Select &quot;Open&quot; Quickbooks at end of install.\r\n4.) Ignore anything Quickbooks asks you and &quot;Cancel/Close&quot; all Quickbooks windows.\r\n5.) Extract RAR file to folder of your choice.\r\n6.) Run &quot;AddUsers.exe&quot; as an administrator and follow on screen instructions - Be Sure to complete all the steps shown by 'AddUsers.exe&quot; BEFORE pressing any key to continue\r\n7.) Enjoy!\r\n\r\n(UPDATE v.16 will add 30 users to 2016 - The tool has been split into two sections, you will need to once for activation, and once again to add users. If you already have an activated copy of QuickBooks and only want to add users you will only need to run this tool once - When I say run twice I mean all software on your machine is closed then run the tool and follow directions. Then CLOSE EVERYTHING or restart for good measure and start with running the tool again for the second time to add users) \r\n\r\nQuickBooks download links:\r\n\r\n\r\n2014 -\r\n  \nhttp://dlm3.download.intuit.com/SBD/QuickBooks/2014/Latest/QuickBooksPro2014.exe \r\n2015 -\r\n  \nhttp://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/Downloads/2015/Latest/Setup_QuickBooksEnterprise15.exe\r\n\r\n2016 - \r\n  \nhttp://dlm2.download.intuit.com/akdlm/SBD/QuickBooks/2016/US_R1/QuickBooksEnterprise16.exe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c4ca574f7ff96862a071ba48798ecbb433d5655","amp;dn":"Quickbooks+Activator+%2B+30+Users+2013+2014+2015+2016+v.16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c4ca574f7ff96862a071ba48798ecbb433d5655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,76,165,116,247,255,150,134,42,7,27,164,135,152,236,187,67,61,86,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
