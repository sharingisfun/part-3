However, he founded the band when he was studying in Tornio. The band was originally a side project of Mr. Lordi. The band recorded an album in 1999 called &quot;Bend Over and Pray the Lord&quot; that was never released due to the record company going out of business.\n\nLordi means &quot;lord&quot; in English.\n\nThe song &quot;Would You Love a Monsterman?&quot; was a number one hit in Finland.\n\nLordi won the 2006 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest in Athens (Greece) with the song 'Hard Rock Hallelujah'. After the Eurovision contest, a central square in Rovaniemi was renamed Lordi Square.\n\nShortly after winning the Eurovision Song Contest, Lordi held a concert at Market Square in Helsinki, where 90,000 Fins helped Lordi celebrate their victory by singing along on the song &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;. This earned them the world record for largest sing-a-long.\n\nFormer bassist Kalma still plays live rhythm guitar at some Lordi shows.\n\n&quot;Dark Floors - The Lordi Motion Picture&quot;, a horror movie based on ideas of Mr. Lordi and featuring the Lordi band members in supporting roles, was released in 2008. It was directed by Pete Riski and despite being the most expensive film ever produced in Finland until then it was something of a box office flop (though its DVD sales reached gold status).\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nMr. Lordi\tVocals\nAmen\tGuitars\nOX\tBass\nMana\tDrums\nHella\tKeyboards\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nGet Heavy (2002)\nThe Monsterican Dream (2004)\nThe Arockalypse (2006)\nDeadache (2008)\nBabez for Breakfast (2010)\nTo Beast or Not to Beast (2013)\nScare Force One (2014)\n\n\n\nScare Force One (2014)\n\n\n\n01.
