Your brain was thought to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“hardwiredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to function in predetermined ways. It turns out that's not true. Your brain is not hardwired, it's &quot;softwired&quot; by experience. This book shows you how you can rewire parts of the brain to feel more positive about your life, remain calm during stressful times, and improve your social relationships. \n\n Written by a leader in the field of Brain-Based Therapy, it teaches you how to activate the parts of your brain that have been underactivated and calm down those areas that have been hyperactivated so that you feel positive about your life and remain calm during stressful times. You will also learn to improve your memory, boost your mood, have better relationships, and get a good night sleep.\n\n * Reveals how cutting-edge developments in neuroscience, and evidence-based practices can be used to improve your everyday life\n * Other titles by Dr. Arden include: Brain-Based Therapy-Adult, Brain-Based Therapy-Child, Improving Your Memory For Dummies and Heal Your Anxiety Workbook\n * Dr. Arden is a leader in integrating the new developments in neuroscience with psychotherapy and Director of Training in Mental Health for Kaiser Permanente for the Northern California Region\n\nExplaining exciting new developments in neuroscience and their applications to daily living, Rewire Your Brain will guide you through the process of changing your brain so you can change your life and be free of self-imposed limitations.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ec67145aa5ad7a541b637bfd800a1e60a6f4824","amp;dn":"Rewire+Your+Brain%3A+Think+Your+Way+to+a+Better+Life+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ec67145aa5ad7a541b637bfd800a1e60a6f4824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,198,113,69,170,90,215,165,65,182,55,191,216,0,161,230,10,111,72,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
