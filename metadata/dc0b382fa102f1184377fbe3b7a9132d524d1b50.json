Bartleby B\nGaines (Long) is a high school senior whose street smarts just never\nseemed to translate into the classroom, and whose bad luck in love has\nleft him pining for the unattainable Monica (Blake Lively). When Bartleby\nand his rebellious crew of outcasts find the frequent college rejection\nletters they have all been receiving bringing endless grief from their\ndisappointed parents, they soon band together to create the fictional\nSouth Harmon Institute of Technology. After creating a believable facade\nin an abandoned psychiatric hospital, employing the talents of a close\nfriend's brilliantly subversive uncle (Lewis Black) to pose as the dean\nand creating a phony website in order to sell the school to their parents\nBartleby and friends soon realize that all of their hard work has paid off\nin ways than they never imagined. With a variety of college rejects\nattempting to enroll in classes at the ersatz university and the\nskepticism of some privileged students from a nearby college drawing\nunwanted attention to the South Harmon Institute of Technology, Bartleby\nand friends find their ruse becoming ever more difficult to maintain.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Justin Long.\n=&gt;-Jonah Hill.\n=&gt;-Blake Lively.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Steve Pink.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : Drama : Crime.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2006.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.21 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 867 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 32mn.\n=&gt;-Accepted...................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/accepted/\n=&gt;-Accepted...................: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/accepted/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1750 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 199 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0b382fa102f1184377fbe3b7a9132d524d1b50","amp;dn":"Accepted+-+Crime+Comedy+2006+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0b382fa102f1184377fbe3b7a9132d524d1b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,11,56,47,161,2,241,24,67,119,251,227,183,169,19,45,82,77,27,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
