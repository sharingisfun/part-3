The libretto is by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic HalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vy, based on the novella of the same title by Prosper MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, first published in 1845,[1] itself influenced by the narrative poem The Gypsies (1824) by Alexander Pushkin.[2] MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e had read the poem in Russian by 1840 and translated it into French in 1852.[3]\n\nThe opera premiered at the OpÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ra-Comique of Paris on 3 March 1875, but its opening run was denounced by the majority of critics.[4] It was almost withdrawn after its fourth or fifth performance, and although this was avoided, ultimately having 48 performances in its first run,[5] it did little to bolster sagging receipts at the OpÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ra-Comique. Near the end of this run, the theatre was giving tickets away in order to stimulate attendance. Bizet died of a heart attack, aged 36, on 3 June 1875, never knowing how popular Carmen would become. In October 1875 it was produced in Vienna, to critical and popular success, which began its path to worldwide popularity.[6] It was not staged again at the OpÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ra Comique until 1883.\n\nSince the 1880s it has been one of the world's most performed operas[7] and a staple of the operatic repertoire. Carmen appears as number four on Opera America's list of the 20 most-performed operas in North America.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255868/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255868/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Baltsa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Baltsa&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Carreras&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Carreras&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVideo #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : VC-1\n      Format profile : MP@ML\n      Codec ID : WMV3\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Video 9\n      Codec ID/Hint : WMV3\n      Duration : 2h 43mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 1 000 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.130\n      Stream size : 1.14 GiB (90%)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : WMA2\n      Format profile : L\n      Codec ID : 161\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Audio 2\n      Description of the codec : Windows Media Audio 9.2 -  96 kbps, 44 kHz, stereo 2-pass VBR\n      Duration : 2h 43mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 96.1 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 112 MiB (9%)\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0de1c86506493ee16439f5b40c03e951af882188","amp;dn":"Carmen+-+Bizet+-+Metropolitan+Opera+-Baltsa%2C+Carreras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0de1c86506493ee16439f5b40c03e951af882188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,225,200,101,6,73,62,225,100,57,245,180,12,3,233,81,175,136,33,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
