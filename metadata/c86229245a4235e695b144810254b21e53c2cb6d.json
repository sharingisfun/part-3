Now, filled with rage and presumed dead from the horrific explosion, Castle takes to the city's underground sewer tunnels to bring his own brutal brand of vigilante justice to the streets and wreak vengeance on those who killed his family.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;The Punisher (2004) - This dark action film, based on the comic book series, follows FBI agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) as he transforms into the vengeful Punisher after criminals murder his family, including his wife and son. Castle is gravely injured in the attack and believed to be dead by Howard Saint (John Travolta), the crime lord who ordered the hit. Following his recovery, Castle becomes a heavily armed vigilante who will stop at nothing to exact revenge on Saint and dismantle his underworld empire.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;The Punisher: War Zone (2008) - Frank Castle, aka The Punisher (Ray Stevenson), turns the streets of New York City red as he wages a one man war against the crime syndicate responsible for the death of his wife and two kids. Aided by his trusted sidekick, Microchip (Wayne Knight), he almost kills Billy Russoti (Dominic West) and leaves him horribly disfigured. Billy renames himself Jigsaw and with the help of his crazed brother Loony Bin Jim, recruits criminals from every corner of the city to do battle with Frank.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nName (Title): The PUNISHER: 1989, 2004, and WAR ZONE (2008)\r\n\r\nCategory Type: Movies\r\n\r\nLength (Duration): Varies by Film\r\n\r\nYear(s): 1989, 2004, and 2008 (respectively).\r\n\r\nStarring: Dolph Lundgren, Thomas Jane, John Travolta, Ray Stevenson\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Action, Thriller, Crime, Drama\r\n\r\nResolution: 720p\r\n\r\nRip Type (Source): BrRip\r\n\r\nCodec Type: x264\r\n\r\nFormat of File(s): MP4(s).\r\n\r\nAudio Format &amp; Language(s): AAC (English).\r\n\r\nSubtitles: YES (English).\r\n\r\nChapters: No.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link(s): \r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098141/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330793/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450314/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86229245a4235e695b144810254b21e53c2cb6d","amp;dn":"The+PUNISHER%3A+1989%2C+2004%2C+and+WAR+ZONE+%282008%29+-+720p+BrRip+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86229245a4235e695b144810254b21e53c2cb6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,98,41,36,90,66,53,230,149,177,68,129,2,84,178,30,83,194,203,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
