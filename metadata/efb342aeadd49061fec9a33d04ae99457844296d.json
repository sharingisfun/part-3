With his first book written as a way to heal after a broken relationship, Liam has slowly become disheartened with writing strictly for romantic fantasy, something evident to a sweet, but honest, journalist who reviews books, Sophie Atkinson (Amy Acker), whom he meets by chance on a plane. The two begin a tentative relationship in Sophie's home town of Portland, Maine, where Liam has come to find inspiration for his newest entry.\n\nLiam's agent puts him on the spot with a long-planned reveal of Gabriel August's true identity, but Sophie doesn't know of his public persona. The longer Liam avoids telling her the truth, the deeper a hole he digs for himself. Will their romance survive once his true identity comes to light?
