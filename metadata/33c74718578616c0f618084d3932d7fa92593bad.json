The members are Riktam and Bansi, from GMS, Raja Ram and Chicago. The name 1200 Micrograms comes from a Raja Ram taking a 1200 microgram dose of LSD while working on the groups first album. Raja Ram told his friend Paul Taylor, &quot;God Paul I took 1200 micrograms!&quot; (Raja was experiencing mental block on a specific track and took this dose of LSD in order to finish the track). Their music is known for the heavy use of guitars and a focus on themes related to the places where they sampled drugs.The idea for starting the project allegedly came to Raja Ram while he was thinking about making an album about the drugs he was on in his favorite places. Thus, their first, self-titled album featured 9 tracks about Ayahuasca and DMT, Mescaline, LSD, Marijuana and Hashish, Ecstasy, Magic Mushrooms, Salvia Divinorum. The tracks featured many quotes from Terence McKenna and samples from movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The album has been a big success, and 1200 Mics even released a Marijuana music video in 2003.\nThe second album, Heroes of the Imagination, was dedicated to famous inventors and scientists, including Leonardo Da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Michael Faraday, Albert Einstein, Charles Babbage, Albert Hofmann, Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Tim Berners-Lee. This album also contains the 2003 party hit, Acid for Nothing, a trance remix of Dire Straits' Money for Nothing (the track also replaced the phrase &quot;I want my MTV&quot; with &quot;I want my LSD&quot;).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1200_Micrograms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1200_Micrograms&lt;/a&gt;\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2002 - 1200 Micrograms - 1200 Micrograms\n2003 - 1200 Micrograms - Acid For Nothing EP\n2003 - 1200 Micrograms - Heroes of the Imagination\n2003 - 1200 Micrograms - LSD EP\n2004 - 1200 Micrograms - High Paradise Promo Cds Sounds Int\n2004 - 1200 Micrograms - The Time Machine\n2005 - 1200 Micrograms - Live in Brazil\n2006 - 1200 Micrograms - 1200 Micrograms Remixes\n2006 - 1200 Micrograms - Drugs, Music And Magic EP\n2006 - AC DC - Thunder Struck (1200 Micrograms remix)\n2007 - 1200 Micrograms - Magic Numbers\n2007 - 1200 Micrograms Vs Michelle Adamson - God Of Rock (Unreleased)\n________________________________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33c74718578616c0f618084d3932d7fa92593bad","amp;dn":"1200+Micrograms+-+Discography+%282002-2007%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33c74718578616c0f618084d3932d7fa92593bad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,199,71,24,87,134,22,192,246,24,8,77,57,50,215,250,146,89,59,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
