He departed shortly thereafter to pursue a solo career, not only as a singer but also as a songwriter and producer. Hollister's first recorded effort as a solo act, the Erick Sermon/Redman collaboration &quot;Weekend,&quot; was featured on the movie soundtrack The Ride and released as a single in 1998. His solo debut album, Ghetto Hymns, was issued in 1999. The autobiographical Chicago '85... The Movie followed a year later. The album eventually went gold thanks to the popularity of &quot;One Woman Man.&quot; In 2002, Hollister left DreamWorks for Motown in search of some new energy. His third album, Things in the Game Done Changed appeared the same year and reflected Hollister's change in sound, although it didn't fare as well as his previous releases. Quickly returning to his original label, Hollister issued Real Talk in fall 2003. He then signed with Gospo Centric and released 2006's The Book of David, Vol. 1: The Transition. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Before I Let You Go\n02.Baby Mama Drama (Explicit)\n03.My Favorite Girl (Explicit)\n04.One Woman Man (Explicit)\n05.Take Care Of Home\n06.Tell Me Why\n07.Baby Do Those Things\n08.It's OK\n09.I'm Wrong\n10.Real Talk\n11.Good Ole Ghetto\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c2f332ee2a5d6c92301eb9cca6a19d43c30431","amp;dn":"Dave+Hollister+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282008%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c2f332ee2a5d6c92301eb9cca6a19d43c30431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,194,243,50,238,42,93,108,146,48,30,185,204,166,161,157,67,195,4,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
