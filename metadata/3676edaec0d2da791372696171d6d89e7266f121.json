The cab and replaceable front end (buffer-bar) derives from the latest Eurosprinter model[3] i.e. locomotives such as the Belgian SNCB Class 18 or Portuguese CP Class 4700.\n\n\nThis package contains:\n\nElectrical Locomotive siemens Vectron\nRealistic sound effects (recorded from the real locomotive).
