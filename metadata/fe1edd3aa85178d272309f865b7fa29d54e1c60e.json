This type of acute inflammatory response is the body's reaction to trauma, and it's an essential part of the healing process. But inflammation can be harmful when it hangs around too long and refuses to leave. When the inflammation switch refuses to turn off, the body operates as if it is always under attack (the older we get, the more likely this is to happen). White blood cells flood the system for weeks, months, and even years.\n\nResearchers are now linking low-grade, persistent inflammation to premature aging, heart disease, M.S., diabetes, Alzheimer's, psoriasis, arthritis, and cancer.\nWhile anti-inflammatory drugs do exist, they can injure the stomach or suppress the immune system. Fortunately, the situation can be remedied by a change in diet, specifically by altering the kinds of fats you eat. Omega-3 fatty acids tend to decrease inflammation while omega-6 fats and trans-fats increase inflammation. While many foods in the standard American diet (unrefined white flour, sugar, red meat, diary, fast food, and food additives) exacerbate inflammation, a healthy diet made up of fish, nuts, seeds, oils, lean grass-fed meats, and fruits and vegetables can help lessen or prevent inflammation. Likewise, certain spices such as turmeric, cloves, and ginger have proven anti-inflammatory activity.\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Foods for Health will help those with inflammation incorporate anti-inflammatory foods into their everyday diet. Sample recipes may include French-Canadian Pea Soup, Sumac Salmon, Maple-Ginger Butternut Squash, Lime-Ginger Glazed Chicken with Fennel Relish, Green Salad with Grapes and Sunflower Seeds, Cod with Saffron Sauce, and more.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1edd3aa85178d272309f865b7fa29d54e1c60e","amp;dn":"Anti-Inflammatory+Foods+for+Health%3A+Hundreds+of+Ways+to+Incorpor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1edd3aa85178d272309f865b7fa29d54e1c60e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,30,221,58,168,81,120,210,114,48,159,134,91,127,162,157,84,225,198,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
