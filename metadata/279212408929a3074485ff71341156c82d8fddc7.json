Squaring up to Camden's nutty boys is a son of Wimbledon - Jamie Alexander Treays, better known as Jamie T, with Trick, his second album in two years, making up for a long period of silence with a roughshod jangle of tunes that recall The Clash of the Sandinista era.\r\n\r\nCalming things down is singer-songwriter Beth Orton, who has dramatically reinvented the folktronica of her earliest work with the electronica of sixth album Kidsticks, which was recorded in the US and features Beth's plaintive voice floating on some great grooves and ambient soundscapes.\r\n\r\nIntroducing the commanding falsetto of new US R&amp;B leading man Gallant. Christopher Gallant hails from Maryland and recorded his debut album Ology on the West Coast, blending slow beats with some alt-rock influences. He got a standing ovation when making his US tv debut on Jimmy Fallon's chat show. Also introducing Rag'n'Bone Man, a big bruiser of a man from Uckfield near Brighton, with his debut single, the tender Human, a piano ballad which manages to be both vulnerable and threatening at the same time.\r\n\r\nThere is also an appearance by The Divine Comedy, fronted by Neil Hannon, who perform tracks from their album Foreverland.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 5157Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 50i/MBAFF\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 6\r\nRun-Time: 61 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 2.48 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:279212408929a3074485ff71341156c82d8fddc7","amp;dn":"BBC+Later+with+Jools+Holland+S49E02+1080i+HDTV+h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"279212408929a3074485ff71341156c82d8fddc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,146,18,64,137,41,163,7,68,133,255,113,52,17,86,200,45,143,221,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
