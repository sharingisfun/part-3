Author Paul F. Aubin guides designers into thinking both in and out of the box, through discovering and applying industry standard best practices, employing creative and sometimes unconventional techniques and procedures, and finding ways to make models serve multiple concurrent project goals. \nTopics include:\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUnderstanding some different approaches to modeling\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBuilding an in-place mass\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating and manipulating massing forms\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUsing X-Ray and Dissolve\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tPerforming an energy analysis\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tApplying geometry to surfaces\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tConfiguring divided surfaces\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tNesting massing families\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tStitching borders with adaptive components\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with lofting techniques\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tAdding dormers and soffits\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tChoosing a wall modeling strategy\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with curtain walls\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tBuilding custom stairs\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating a custom material\n\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4198aa79f8d9a1dfd64de5cfa4dc1fc01a6d597","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Advanced+Modeling+in+Revit+Architecture+with+Paul+F.+Aub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4198aa79f8d9a1dfd64de5cfa4dc1fc01a6d597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,25,138,167,159,141,154,29,253,100,222,92,250,77,193,252,1,166,213,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
