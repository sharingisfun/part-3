No suitable audio version of book 6 could ever be found.\n\nDavina Porter narrates books 1, 2, 3, 5 and 19. Terence Hardiman narrates books 4 and 9 to 15, except that Geoffrey Annis narrates book 7.\nGordan Griffin narrates book 16 and Ralph Lister narrates books 17 and 18. Deirdra Whelan narrates book 20.\n\n(I have deliberately avoided readings by David Colacci as I find his American accent unconvincing for these purely British novels).\n\nMost are recorded at 32 kbps / 22 kHz Mono CBR MP3, except for books 4, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19 and 20 which either 48 kbps or 40 kbps Mono CBR MP3.\n\nMany thanks to Phyl for providing better copies of books 1 to 3 and book 17.
