The underlying basis of \nUniversal Document Converter is the technology of virtual printing. As a result, \nexporting Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft Excel tables, Microsoft PowerPoint \npresentations and Autodesk AutoCAD drawings into a chosen format is not any more \ncomplicated than printing on a desktop printer.\n\nUniversal Document Converter can assist you in preparing documents to be published\non websites, protect them from unsanctioned copying and changes when sent by email,\nsave tons of time while preparing PowerPoint presentations, and also simplify the \nprocess of sending materials to the printshop or publisher. In addition, you will \nbe able to cut expenses on the development and implementation of a corporate \ndocument flow system.\n\n\n\n*Product Overview:\n\nExport into 8 formats. \nDocuments of any type can be exported into Adobe PDF or graphical files in 7 \npopular formats: TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PCX, DCX, GIF or BMP. \n\nWork with multipage documents. \nSeveral documents of various types can be united into one multipage file.\n\nUniversality. \nThe technology of virtual printing makes it possible to convert documents of any \ntype, including multipage reports, technical drawings and commercial posters, \ninto a chosen format.\n\nPracticality. \nThe direct export of a document into a graphical file (instead of printing and \nscanning a paper copy) economizes on expendable materials and time.\n\nEase of use. \nFor exporting documents of any type into Adobe PDF or graphical files all that is \nrequired is to print them using the printer labeled 'Universal Document Converter'.\n\nThe advanced algorithm of quantization. \nAdvanced algorithm for image quantization makes it possible to produce the highest\nquality copies even when converting them into a black and white format.\n\nHigh resolution. \nThe ability to export documents with a resolution up to 2,400 DPI enables you to \nsave all elements of design of advertising materials and the minutest details of \ndrawings and electronic diagrams.\n\nAutomatic margin cropping. \nThe function of automatic cropping of empty margins makes it unnecessary to edit \ngraphical copies of tables and diagrams before placing them in presentations or \ntext documents.\n\nEconomy of system resources. \nLow consumption of system resources enables you to export documents of practically \nany size which can contain hundreds of pages.\n\nFlexibility in configuration. \nThe flexibility in configuring the program makes it possible to choose the \noptimal ratio between the quality of documents copies and the size of output files.\nFor example, for publication on a website the smallest possible files are needed. \nOn the other hand, for preparing documents to be sent to the printshop, files are \nrequired that are high resolution and compressed without quality loss.\n\nQuick configuration. \nA profile library (collection of settings with optimal conversions for standard \nconversion tasks) makes it possible to configure Universal Document Converter \nwith two clicks of the mouse.\n\nRemote usage. \nCompatibility with Microsoft Windows Terminal Services and Citrix makes it \npossible to use Universal Document Converter from remote computers.\n\nScalability. \nThe possibility to share Universal Document Converter over a network and use it \nfrom workstations allows for a significant increase in speed for the conversion \nof documents.\n\nCOM-interface. \nThe presence of a COM-interface simplifies the compatibility of document flow \nsystems with Universal Document Converter.\n\n \n\n*Fields of Application:\n\nDocument Sharing and Archiving.\nExchanging documents in the Adobe PDF format protects you and your clients from \nany technical difficulties. \n\nPresentation Creation.\nDocuments converted to JPEG or PNG graphic formats can be easily inserted into \nyour PowerPoint presentations without any problems. \n\nWeb Publishing.\nPublishing presentation materials and product catalogs in the Adobe PDF format \noffers clients all needed information in a reliable and change-protected form. \n\nPreparing Layouts for the Printshop.\nConverting documents into the TIFF format guarantees high printing quality and \nsimplifies work with printshops and publishers. \n\nCorporate Workflow System Deployment.\nUniversal Document Converter reduces your expenses on the development of a \ncorporate workflow system. \n \n\n\n*What's new in Universal Document Converter v5.0.909.4130:\n\n- Compatibility with 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows systems added. \n- New version of the graphical interface implemented. \n- Additional language localizations for the interface in Italian, French &amp;

Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\nAlso scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware \ndetected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at November, 07 2009 - 17.10 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ddcb747f7018f2cfc1c225b3fbf0422bc97ef5","amp;dn":"Universal+Document+Converter+v5.0.909.4130+%2B+Crack+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ddcb747f7018f2cfc1c225b3fbf0422bc97ef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,221,203,116,127,112,24,242,207,193,194,37,179,251,240,66,43,201,126,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
