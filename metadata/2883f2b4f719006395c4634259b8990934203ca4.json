RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: UbiDRM\n1 :.......... DISC(S) ..

You activate this ability by looking in\nthe direction you want to go - if the Power of the Eagle is available to\nuse, you will see a reticle appear with two wings.\n\nOnce you press the button to activate the ability, Raton will transform\ninto an eagle and streak towards the new location completely unseen!\nBest of all, you can use this ability while running or jumping to\ndramatically increase the distance of your jumps or even save yourself\nfrom a nasty fall.\n\nOf course, the Power of the Eagle would not be complete if it didnt include\nsome kind of offensive component as well. Consequently, we've included the\nEagle Strike, which will enable you to power dive into a foe, ending their\nlife with the swiftness of a deadly raptor! Will this extraordinary ability\nbe enough to ensure that Ratonhnhakton can stand against King Washington\nand his remaining lackeys Israel Putnam and Benjamin Franklin?\n\n1. Mount the image.\n2.
