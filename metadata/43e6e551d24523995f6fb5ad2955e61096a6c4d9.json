Or to look back on Earth from outer space and see the surprisingly precise line between day and night? Or to stand in front of the Hubble Space Telescope, wondering if the emergency repair youÃ¢Â€â„¢re about to make will inadvertently ruin humankindÃ¢Â€â„¢s chance to unlock the universeÃ¢Â€â„¢s secrets? Mike Massimino has been there, and in Spaceman he puts you inside the suit, with all the zip and buoyancy of life in microgravity.\r\nMassiminoÃ¢Â€â„¢s childhood space dreams were born the day Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon. Growing up in a working-class Long Island family, he catapulted himself to Columbia and then MIT, only to flunk his first doctoral exam and be rejected three times by NASA before making it through the final round of astronaut selection.\r\nTaking us through the surreal wonder and beauty of his first spacewalk, the tragedy of losing friends in the Columbia shuttle accident, and the development of his enduring love for the Hubble Telescopeâ€”which he and his fellow astronauts were tasked with saving on his final missionâ€”Massimino has written an ode to never giving up and the power of teamwork to make anything possible. Spaceman invites us into a rare, wonderful world where science meets the most thrilling adventure, revealing just what having â€œthe right stuffâ€ really means","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43e6e551d24523995f6fb5ad2955e61096a6c4d9","amp;dn":"Spaceman+%3A+An+Astronauts+Unlikely+Journey+to+Unlock+the+Secrets+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43e6e551d24523995f6fb5ad2955e61096a6c4d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,230,229,81,210,69,35,153,95,111,181,173,41,85,230,16,150,166,196,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
