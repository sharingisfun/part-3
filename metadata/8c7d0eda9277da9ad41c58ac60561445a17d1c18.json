With over 26 million albums sold worldwide they have made their mark in rock and roll history. Their new album, 'Dark Horse', is one of the most anticipated releases this year. The band brought in legendary producer Mutt Lange to produce the record with Nickelback and longtime collaborator Joey Moi. This album while different, is still very much the Nickelback you expect! Solid riffs; good drum beats. All around, great!\n\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Something in your mouth                              [03:39]\n02.Burn it to the ground                                [03:31]\n03.Gotta be somebody                                    [04:13]\n04.I'd come for you                                     [04:23]\n05.Next go round                                        [03:45]\n06.Just to get high                                     [04:02]\n07.Never gonna be alone                                 [03:47]\n08.Shakin' hands                                        [03:40]\n09.S.E.X.
