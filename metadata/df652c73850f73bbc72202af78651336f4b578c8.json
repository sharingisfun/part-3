Welcome to the team. - Big Papi\n\n\nBy The Wickerman\n\nThe Beatles put out the White Album, Metallica put out the Black Album, and then Collective Soul put out the Blue Album. In short, self-titled, monochromatic albums will never let you down. How can anyone not love this album? This is one of the first albums I ever bought, and it still sounds fresh each time I listen to it. \n\nIt's kind of hard to classify, it's too heavy to be considered alternative, yet it's not quite metal. Maybe, alternative hard rock? Well, whatever it is, it is good stuff. Fans of both alternative and metal alike should enjoy it. Highlights are...everything! There is not a bad moment on this album. Ross Childress is an incredible soloist, and Ed Roland is a very soulful, versatile vocalist. The first time I heard &quot;December&quot;, I could have sworn there were two or three guys singing lead, and that it couldn't possibly be one guy. But, it is! \n\nYou've got a wide variety of songs here, from hard rock (&quot;Simple&quot;, &quot;Where the River Flows&quot;) to melodic (&quot;The World I Know&quot;, &quot;When the Water Falls&quot;) to just unusual (&quot;Gel&quot;, &quot;Collection of Goods&quot;). And, if that ride wasn't exciting enough, the album ends in a soft, gospel-type song called &quot;Reunion&quot;, with what appears to be a church choir backing the band. At the end, you're just thinking, &quot;man, that was good!&quot;.\n\n I recommend this album to anyone. It will never get old. This is the second best alt-rock type album I've ever heard, right behind Live's &quot;Throwing Copper&quot;. I was hoping for another album like this in &quot;Blender&quot; after the very mediocre &quot;Dosage&quot;, but no such luck. You can buy those albums if you want, but this is the definitive Collective Soul album.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nCollective Soul - Collective Soul\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Collective Soul\nAlbum................: Collective Soul\nGenre................: American Alternative, Adult Alternative, Hard Rock &amp; Metal\nSource...............: CD\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
