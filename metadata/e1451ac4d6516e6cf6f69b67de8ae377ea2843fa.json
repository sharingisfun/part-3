Allegiances run from the general (Chicago versus New York style, Neapolitan versus Roman) to the particular (Pepe's versus Sally's, Gino's East versus Pizzeria Uno), and new interpretations ever extend the pizza frontier.In AMERICAN PIE, master bread baker Peter Reinhart follows the trail from Italy to the States, capturing the stories behind the greatest artisanal pizzas of the Old World and the New. \n\nBeginning his journey in Genoa, Reinhart scours the countryside in search of the fabled focaccia col formaggio. He next heads to Rome to sample the famed seven-foot-long pizza al taglio, and then to Naples for the archetypal pizza napoletana. Back in America, the hunt resumes in the unlikely locale of Phoenix, Arizona, where Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco has convinced many that his pie sets the new standard in the country. The pizza mecca of New Haven, grilled pizza in Providence, the deep-dish pies of Chicago, California-style pizza in San Francisco and Los AngelesÃ¢â‚¬â€these are just a few of the tasty attractions on Reinhart's epic tour. \n\nReturning to the kitchen, Reinhart gives a master class on pizza-making techniques and provides more than 60 recipes for doughs, sauces and toppings, and the pizzas that bring them all together. His insatiable curiosity and gift for storytelling make AMERICAN PIE essential reading for those who aspire to make great pizza at home, as well as for anyone who enjoys the thrill of the hunt.\n\nA fascinating look into the great pizzas and pizzerias of Italy and America.\nPeter Reinhart's last book, THE BREAD BAKER'S APPRENTICE, was named Cookbook of the Year by both the James Beard Foundation and the International Association of Culinary Professionals.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Cookery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1451ac4d6516e6cf6f69b67de8ae377ea2843fa","amp;dn":"American+Pie%3A+My+Search+for+the+Perfect+Pizza+by+Peter+Reinhart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1451ac4d6516e6cf6f69b67de8ae377ea2843fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,69,26,196,214,81,110,108,246,246,155,103,222,138,227,119,234,40,67,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
