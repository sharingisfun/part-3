When she found someone who was, Ham walked out of her life. Three years later, Zara's lost her business, her marriage, and she's barely getting by in a tiny apartment on the wrong side of the tracks. As soon as Ham hears about Zara's plight, he's on her doorstep offering her a lifeline. Now, it will take every ounce of will power she possesses to resist all that he offers.\n\nHam was always a traveling man, never one to settle down in one town, with one woman, for more time than absolutely necessary. But Ham's faced his own demons, and he's learned a lot. About himself, and about the life he knows he's meant to live. So when he hears that Zara's having a rough time, he wants to be the one to help. In fact, he wants to do more than that for Zara. A lot more. But first, he must prove to Zara that he's a changed man","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1b9e671b3c764b8a5bc02df4d5cef3a42adfed8","amp;dn":"Kristen+Ashley+-Jagged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1b9e671b3c764b8a5bc02df4d5cef3a42adfed8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,185,230,113,179,199,100,184,165,188,2,223,77,92,239,58,66,173,254,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
