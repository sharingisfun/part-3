ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bit masochistic to enjoy feeling miserable. Maybe weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just drawn to music that can relate to our darkest moments. After all, songs like the BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShe Loves You YeahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t describe every day of your life. It can actually make you feel worse in the wrong context. Some times you need a good break-up album to snuggle up with, knowing someone felt as crappy as you did at one point.\n\n    But the AntlersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Hospice is not your typical ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWah, my girlfriend dumped meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album. It actually speaks of a pain very few people can relate to. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very loose story throughout based on the idea of caring for an abusive terminally ill loved one, investing total emotional strength and doing everything possible to no avail. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a unique sense of hopelessness spoken through singer Peter SilbermanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tragically beautiful lyrics backed by soft and swelling instrumentation and straining ambient textures that almost perfectly capture the desperate pain behind the words. From the haunting grind of the opening ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPrologueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the final notes of SilbermanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s falsetto in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEpilogue,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ this whole album left me absolutely floored. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not music to wallow in your sorrow to; it draws you into its own world with its own pain. And in the end, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all about overcoming rather than sulking.\n\n    The Antlers self-released Hospice earlier this year, but it was picked up by French Kiss records within months after receiving praise from the music world and selling out nearly every copy available. Despite its humble beginnings, Hospice easily ranks among the best albums of the year. I picked out the track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the best individual songs, but you should really listen to this album front to back to fully appreciate its beauty.\n\n\n\nSometimes you have to put yourself first, no matter how difficult that notion seems; no matter how much time and effort youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve already put into this one personÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the person whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reduced your very being to its absolute core. Just ask Peter Silberman, the string-pulling founder of The Antlers, a solo project that suddenly went widescreen on the self-released Hospice LP (now receiving a proper widespread pressing through Frenchkiss). The first Antlers effort to feature two key permanent playersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½powerhouse drummer Michael Lerner and the layer-lathering multi-instrumentalist Darby CicciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album with a sound thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actually as ambitious as its concept.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHospice came from the idea of caring for a terminal patient whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mentally abusive to you,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Silberman. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the right to argue with them, either, because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the one whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dying here; theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the one thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been dealt a wrong hand. So you take it, but you can only take so much. Eventually, you realize that this person is just destroying you.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Appropriately enough, HospiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 10 distinct chapters resonate on debilitating sonic and lyrical levels, from the hypnotic harp and tension-ratcheting build of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTwoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the sing-or-sink choruses of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the speaker-rattling peaks of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSylvia,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ easily one of the yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most immediate epics.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s here, amidst contrasting shards of ambient noise, sweeping strings and smoky horns, where The Antlers truly transcend SilbermanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s singer-songwriter beginningsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a striking escalation of expectations first hinted at on 2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New York Hospitals EP. The progression doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t end there, either. In a move that could be taken as the riff-raking extension of his thorough guitar training (from the age of 6 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“til right before college), ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAtrophyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ delve into sheets of distortion, subtle shades of soul, cicada-like effects and enough movements to fill an entire EP. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe were going for something thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be dense but not too complicated,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ explains Silberman. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI hate the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“lush,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ but I guess thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the best way of describing it.\n\nThe structures are like pop songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½verse/chorus, verse/chorusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but the sound is a little more shoegaze-y or post-rocky.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about to get even more complicated, too, as The AntlersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Technicolor-tinged trio take all of HospiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and three previous releasesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in a completely different direction, jettisoning a note-for-note rendition of the record for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa massive soundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ doused in delay, reverb and unrehearsed chaos. And to think Cicci was a stage actor with a desire to drop it all for music just a few years ago. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHospice was the clear indication that this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a singer-songwriter thing at all,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Silberman. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhatever we record next is going to define the three of us as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“band.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ He continues, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI always figured IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“shredderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in a groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦But things somehow ended up this way.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ We wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have it any other way, either.\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\n01.
