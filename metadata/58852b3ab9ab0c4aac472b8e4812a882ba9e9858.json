At universities and in the media, professors\r\nand pundits decry Western civilization as exploitative, destructive, and without\r\nvalue. But fear not: coming to its defense is The Politically Incorrect Guide to\r\nWestern Civilization. Using historical evidence, Professor Anthony Esolen knocks\r\ndown the relativist arguments and shows how the West laid the cornerstones\r\nfor all of modern civilization, including historical, artistic, and intellectual\r\nachievements. We owe it to history and to ourselves to acknowledge Western\r\ncivilization's role in shaping our values and our world.\r\n\r\nI bet your college professor never told you:\r\n\r\n* Why &quot;Western civ&quot; is the story of...us\r\n* How the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; yielded tyranny and war\r\n* How climate change affects culture (hint: warmer is better)\r\n* Why Jesus is the most important figure in history\r\n* Why the Middle Ages were the real &quot;Age of Reason&quot;\r\n\r\nTable of Contents:\r\n\r\nChapter 1 - Ancient Greece: Love of Wisdom and Beauty\r\nChapter 2 - Rome: An Empire of Tradition and Patriarchy\r\nChapter 3 - Israel: How God Changed the World\r\nChapter 4 - The Early Church: Charity and Tolerance Are Born\r\nChapter 5 - The High Middle Ages: The Bright Ages\r\nChapter 6 - The Renaissance: It's Not What You Think\r\nChapter 7 - The Enlightenment: Liberty and Tyranny\r\nChapter 8 - The Nineteenth Century: Man Is a God; Man Is a Beast\r\nChapter 9 - The Twentieth Century: A Century of Blood","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58852b3ab9ab0c4aac472b8e4812a882ba9e9858","amp;dn":"The+Politically+Incorrect+Guide+to+Western+Civilization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58852b3ab9ab0c4aac472b8e4812a882ba9e9858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,133,43,58,185,171,12,74,172,71,43,142,72,18,168,130,186,158,152,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
