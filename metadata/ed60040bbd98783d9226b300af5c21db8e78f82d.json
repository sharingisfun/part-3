From a host of in-text features to a range of outstanding technology resources, you'll have everything you need to understand the natural forces and principles of physics. Throughout every chapter, the authors have built in a wide range of examples, exercises, and illustrations that will help you understand the laws of physics AND succeed in your course!\n\nAbout the Authors\nRaymond A. Serway received his doctorate at Illinois Institute of Technology and is Professor Emeritus at James Madison University. In 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from his alma mater, Utica College. He received the 1990 Madison Scholar Award at James Madison University, where he taught for 17 years. In addition to PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS, Dr. Serway is the coauthor of PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS, Fifth Edition; COLLEGE PHYSICS, Ninth Edition; ESSENTIALS OF COLLEGE PHYSICS; MODERN PHYSICS, Third Edition; and the high school textbook PHYSICS, published by Holt McDougal. Dr. Serway and his wife Elizabeth enjoy traveling, playing golf, fishing, gardening, singing in the church choir, and especially spending quality time with their four children, nine grandchildren, and a recent great-grandson.\n\nJohn W. Jewett, Jr., earned his undergraduate degree in physics at Drexel University and his doctorate at Ohio State University, specializing in optical and magnetic properties of condensed matter. Dr. Jewett began his academic career at Richard Stockton College of New Jersey, where he taught from 1974 to 1984. He is currently Emeritus Professor of Physics at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Through his teaching career, Dr. Jewett is the author of THE WORLD OF PHYSICS: MYSTERIES, MAGIC, AND MYTH, which provides many connections between physics and everyday experiences. In addition to his work on PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS, he is the coauthor for PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS, Fifth Edition, as well as GLOBAL ISSUES, a four-volume set of instruction manuals in integrated science for high school. Dr. Jewett enjoys playing keyboard with his all-physicist band, traveling, and collecting antique quack medical devices that can be used as demonstration apparatus in physics lectures. Most importantly, he relishes spending time with his wife Lisa and their children and grandchildren. \n\nBrief Contents\nPart 1 - Mechanics 1\n1 Physics and Measurement 2\n2 Motion in One Dimension 21\n3 Vectors 59\n4 Motion in Two Dimensions 78\n5 The Laws of Motion 111\n6 Circular Motion and Other Applications of NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Laws 150\n7 Energy of a System 177\n8 Conservation of Energy 211\n9 Linear Momentum and Collisions 247\n10 Rotation of a Rigid Object About a Fixed Axis 293\n11 Angular Momentum 335\n12 Static Equilibrium and Elasticity 363\n13 Universal Gravitation 388\n14 Fluid Mechanics 417\nPart 2 - Oscillations and Mechanical Waves 449\n15 Oscillatory Motion 450\n16 Wave Motion 483\n17 Sound Waves 507\n18 Superposition and Standing Waves 533\nPart 3 - Thermodynamics 567\n19 Temperature 568\n20 The First Law of Thermodynamics 590\n21 The Kinetic Theory of Gases 626\n22 Heat Engines, Entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics 653\nPart 4 - Electricity and Magnetism 689\n23 Electric Fields 690\n24 GaussÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Law 725\n25 Electric Potential 746\n26 Capacitance and Dielectrics 777\n27 Current and Resistance 808\n28 Direct-Current Circuits 833\n29 Magnetic Fields 868\n30 Sources of the Magnetic Field 904\n31 FaradayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Law 935\n32 Inductance 970\n33 Alternating-Current Circuits 998\n34 Electromagnetic Waves 1030\nPart 5 - Light and Optics 1057\n35 The Nature of Light and the Principles of Ray Optics 1058\n36 Image Formation 1090\n37 Wave Optics 1134\n38 Diffraction Patterns and Polarization 1160\nPart 6 - Modern Physics 1191\n39 Relativity 1192\n40 Introduction to Quantum Physics 1233\n41 Quantum Mechanics 1267\n42 Atomic Physics 1296\n43 Molecules and Solids 1340\n44 Nuclear Structure 1380\n45 Applications of Nuclear Physics 1418\n46 Particle Physics and Cosmology 1447","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed60040bbd98783d9226b300af5c21db8e78f82d","amp;dn":"Physics+for+Scientists+and+Engineers+with+Modern+Physics+%289th+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed60040bbd98783d9226b300af5c21db8e78f82d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,96,4,11,189,152,120,61,146,38,179,0,175,92,33,219,142,120,248,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
