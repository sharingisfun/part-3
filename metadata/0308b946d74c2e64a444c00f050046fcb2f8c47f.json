Never one to run with the crowd, Bella never cared about fitting in with the trendy, plastic girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother remarried and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect much of anything to change. But things do change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. For Edward is nothing like any boy sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever met. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing like anyone sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever met, period. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intelligent and witty, and he seems to see straight into her soul. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance - unorthodox because Edward really isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like the other boys. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving car with his bare hands. Oh, and he hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s immortal. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right - vampire. But he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have fangs - thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just in the movies. And he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t drink human blood, though Edward and his family are unique among vampires in that lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for - a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. Somehow or other, they will have to manage their unmanageable love. But when unexpected visitors come to town and realize that there is a human among them Edward must fight to save Bella? A modern, visual, and visceral Romeo and Juliet story of the ultimate forbidden love affair - between vampire and mortal.\n\nGenre: Drama | Fantasy | Romance | Thriller\n\nRatings: IMDB: 6.1/10.0 (40,242 votes) | RT: 49%\n\nDirected by: Catherine Hardwicke\n\nStarring: Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Billy Burke, Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed\n\niMDb link...http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/\n\nA DiAMOND LASTS FOREVER\n\nD i A M O N D\n\nP R O U D L Y P R E S E N T i N G: Twilight\n\nTHEATRE DATE: 11.21.08\n\nRELEASE DATE: 03.04.09\n\nSTORE DATE: 03.21.09\n\nGENRE: Drama | Fantasy | Romance\n\nRUNTiME: 122 mins\n\nRATiNG: 6.1/10 40,242 votes\n\n# SCREENiNGS: 3649\n\nViDEO: 1153 kbps xvid\n\nAUDiO: 448 kbps ac3 - 6 CH\n\nRESOLUTiON: 640x272 (2.40:1)\n\n# DiSCS: 2\n\nSUBS: Eng, Spa\n\nFilename: dmd-twilight-cd2 dmd-twilight-cd1\n\nQuality: Lucy in the sky with DiAMONDsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nSUBS included\n\nI have not included the sample, these files are large enough\n\nYou know youre getting quality with a 2CD rip from Diamond !\n\nPlease help seed when download completes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0308b946d74c2e64a444c00f050046fcb2f8c47f","amp;dn":"Twilight.2008.DVDRip.XviD-DiAMOND","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0308b946d74c2e64a444c00f050046fcb2f8c47f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,8,185,70,215,76,46,100,164,68,192,15,5,0,70,252,178,248,196,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
