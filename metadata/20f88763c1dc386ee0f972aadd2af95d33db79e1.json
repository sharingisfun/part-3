Positively overflowing with huge choruses and hooks galore, it's a melting pot of ideas that sets the bands stall out perfectly: a touch of US alt rock-inspired skuzziness here (â€˜Your Lowâ€™), a bit of The La's stripped-down dexterity there ('Delete') and lashings of anthemic, memorable moments make it a compelling, engrossing listen. But with these boys, there's also much more than meets the eye - from lush middle eight's that recall cult Aussie heroes Sleepy Jackson, to 808-inspired grooves, and the gloriously wall of sound guitar effects pedals that push much of the record to the next level.
