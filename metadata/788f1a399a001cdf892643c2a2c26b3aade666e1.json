At this time, most of his colleagues refuse to cure hysteric patients, because they believe they're just simulating to gain attention. But Freud learns to use hypnosis to find out the reasons for the psychosis. His main patient is a young woman who refuses to drink water and is plagued by always the same nightmare.  \n\n\nFile Name .........................................: John Huston - Freud Secret Passion\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,256,425,472 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:14:08\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 624x352 (AR: 1.773)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1111 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.211 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nMy rip.
