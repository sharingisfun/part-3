How should you flip your mattress to get the maximum wear out of it? How does Google search the Internet? How many people should you date before settling down? Believe it or not, math plays a crucial role in answering all of these questions and more.\n \nMath underpins everything in the cosmos, including us, yet too few of us understand this universal language well enough to revel in its wisdom, its beauty Ã¢â‚¬â€ and its joy. This deeply enlightening, vastly entertaining volume translates math in a way that is at once intelligible and thrilling. Each trenchant chapter of The Joy of x offers an Ã¢â‚¬Å“aha!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ moment, starting with why numbers are so helpful, and progressing through the wondrous truths implicit in ?, the Pythagorean theorem, irrational numbers, fat tails, even the rigors and surprising charms of calculus. Showing why he has won awards as a professor at Cornell and garnered extensive praise for his articles about math for the New York Times, Strogatz presumes of his readers only curiosity and common sense. And he rewards them with clear, ingenious, and often funny explanations of the most vital and exciting principles of his discipline.\n \nWhether you aced integral calculus or arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure what an integer is, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find profound wisdom and persistent delight in The Joy of x.\n\n2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:077686b0721df878d5f76550f5b9e0ba6d718e6b","amp;dn":"The+Joy+of+x%3A+A+Guided+Tour+of+Math%2C+from+One+to+Infinity+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"077686b0721df878d5f76550f5b9e0ba6d718e6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,118,134,176,114,29,248,120,213,247,101,80,245,185,224,186,109,113,142,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
