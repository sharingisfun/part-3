Originally presented as a double album with one track on each of the four sides of the LP, its concept is based on singer Jon Anderson's interpretation of four classes of Hindu scripture, collectively named the shastras, from a footnote in Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda. It is the first studio album with drummer Alan White after Bill Bruford left in 1972 to join King Crimson.\n\nTales from Topographic Oceans was a commercial success; it is the first album in the UK to earn a gold certification based on pre-sales alone. It topped the UK album chart for two weeks and peaked at number 6 in the US. The album is noted for the divided reception it received, and the disagreements it caused within the band, resulting in keyboardist Rick Wakeman leaving to pursue his solo career after the supporting tour.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e162de987cedce75fd5ff7f7186233f8901fbdb","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Tales+From+Topographic+Oceans+%5BMp3+320%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e162de987cedce75fd5ff7f7186233f8901fbdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,22,45,233,135,206,220,231,95,213,255,127,113,134,35,63,137,1,251,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
