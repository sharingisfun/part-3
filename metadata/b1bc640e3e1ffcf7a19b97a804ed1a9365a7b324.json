What he doesn't know is that the truck is filled with illegal weapons and now he must fight to survive and save his family.  \n\n\nAll stand-alone DivX Players compatible\n\n\nU P L O A D E R S  F I N A L  N O T E S\n\nSince this is somewhat of a special release I'd like to post more information.\nI tried to find a release of this movie, but all the releases I found had LB 4:3.\nAs this is insanely annoying to watch on a widescreen TV, I decided to download a NTSC DVD I found(Thanks to whoever UL that btw). This also had the LB 4:3 as I expected. So, I used DVD-Rebuilder which has a option to convert LB 4:3 to 16:9.\nThis did require a full re-encode of the DVD. So after that, the quality always suffers a little bit. After that, I went by my standard procedure and encoded it with Gknot. So, other releases on the web is sure to have a little bit better quality than this, but this is the only one that is 16:9. Don't get me wrong though, the quality is very good :)\n\nFor those who don't know, LB 4:3 is a widescreen picture encoded in the 4:3 standard. On a widescreen TV, this will basically have huge borders on ALL sides of the movie.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you'll enjoy this awesome movie :)\n\n-Vex\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease seed!
