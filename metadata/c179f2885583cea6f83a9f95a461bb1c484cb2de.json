Unfortunately for us, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a simple question to answer. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mix between Ã¢â‚¬Å“everythingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“not muchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, depending on how you used BackTrack.\n\nFrom an end user perspective, the most obvious change would be the switch to Debian and an FHS-compliant system. What this means is that instead of having to navigate through the /pentest tree, you will be able to call any tool from anywhere on the system as every application is included in the system path. However, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much hidden magic in that last sentence.
