Buckminster Fuller with the assistance of Kiyoshi Kuromiya. First published in 1981, it is alongside Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth one of Fuller's best-known works. Vast in its scope, it describes Fuller's own vision of the development of human civilization, economic history, and his highly original economic ideology based, amongst other things, on his detailed description of why scarcity of resources need no longer be a decisive factor in global politics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4860ca7a202f3bac7ffb8e528b8a0ef747045b0","amp;dn":"R.+Buckminster+Fuller+-+Critical+path+%28pdf%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4860ca7a202f3bac7ffb8e528b8a0ef747045b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,134,12,167,162,2,243,186,199,255,184,229,40,184,160,239,116,112,69,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
