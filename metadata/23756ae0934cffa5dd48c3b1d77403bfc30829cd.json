Three teenagers are accused of this horrific crime of killing three children, supposedly as a result of involvement in Satanism. As in their previous documentary, things turn out to be more complex than initial appearances and this film presents the real-life courtroom drama to the viewer, as it unfolds\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 707 MiB\nDuration                         : 2h 31mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 651 Kbps\nWriting library                  : VirtualDub build 27021/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 31mn\nBit rate                         : 511 Kbps\nWidth                            : 320 pixels\nHeight                           : 240 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\n&quot;Beyond &quot;Deliverance&quot;, 16 July 2001\nTruth may be stranger than fiction, but the American courtroom is stranger, still. For the two hours during which I've watched this film I've gained a valuable insight into the nature of the witch trials. I feel powerless, as there is not much I can do to help these kids. But perhaps there is a lesson in it for us, and everyone who has seen the film should have taken some mental notes. First -- never name youself or your children 'Damien' -- especially if you live in the Bible Belt. And, as a general survival strategy, do not be the black sheep of the local community. There may come the time when your eccentric behavior alone will be used against you to sentence you to death.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23756ae0934cffa5dd48c3b1d77403bfc30829cd","amp;dn":"Paradise+Lost+The+Child+Murders+at+Robin+Hood+Hills+%281996%29SiLvEr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23756ae0934cffa5dd48c3b1d77403bfc30829cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,117,106,224,147,76,255,165,221,72,195,177,215,116,3,191,195,8,41,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
