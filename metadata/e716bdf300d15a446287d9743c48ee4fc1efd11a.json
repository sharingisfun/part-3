The film is delicate and unhurried, detailing a Christmas dinner at the house of two spinster musician sisters and their niece in turn-of-the-century Ireland, attended by friends and family. Among the visiting attendees are the sisters&amp;#039; nephew Gabriel Conroy and his wife Gretta. The evening&amp;#039;s reminiscences bring up melancholy memories for Gretta concerning her first, long-lost love when she was a girl in rural Galway. Her recounting of this tragic love to Gabriel brings him to an epiphany: he learns the difference between mere existence and living. The all-Irish cast and careful period detail give the piece richness and gravity, and Donal McCann and Anjelica Huston are unforgettable as the Conroys\n\n***\n\nName.........: Dublineses.ARREGLADA.(The.dead,.1987).[Remastered.16Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·9].DVDRip.Dual.Esp-Eng.Divx.Mp3.divxclasico.avi\nFilesize.....: 700 MB (or 717,090 KB or 734,300,160 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:19:24 (119,105 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 1026 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 103 kb/s (51/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\u0002Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡\nFrame Size...: 608x320 (1.90:1) [=19:10]\n\nDual audio: English and Spanish.\n\nNot my rip; many thanks to the original uploader.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=6&amp;thread=2911&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=6&amp;thread=2911&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
