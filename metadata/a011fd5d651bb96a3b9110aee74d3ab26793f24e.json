It has 15 hours on 15 CDs in a handsome, foil-stamped, collector's slipcase. With special bonus tracks never before available, including interviews with the cast members and much more.\n\nWhen this series was first broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, it generated the largest response in the network's history: 50,000 letters and phone calls in a single week, an audience of 750,000 per episode, and a subsequent 40-percent jump in NPR listenership.\n\nThis landmark production, perhaps the most ambitious radio project ever attempted, began when Star Wars creator George Lucas donated the story rights to an NPR affiliate. Writer Brian Daley adapted the film's highly visual script to the special demands and unique possibilities of radio, creating a more richly textured tale with greater emphasis on character development. Director John Madden guided a splendid castÃ¢â‚¬â€including Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels, reprising their film roles as Luke Skywalker and the persnickety robot See ThreepioÃ¢â‚¬â€through an intense 10-day dialogue recording session. Then came months of painstaking work for virtuoso sound engineer Tom Voegeli, whose brilliant blending of the actors' voices, the music, and hundreds of sound effects takes this intergalactic adventure into a realm of imagination that is beyond the reach of cinema.\n\nNOTE - This is the perfect EAC rip in FLAC from what.cd, featuring cue files and all scans. I will also shortly torrent this in V8 for reduced size. Still, this one is important enough to merit a perfect FLAC rip, even for an audiobook.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a011fd5d651bb96a3b9110aee74d3ab26793f24e","amp;dn":"NPR+-+The+Complete+Star+Wars+Trilogy+Radio+Drama+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a011fd5d651bb96a3b9110aee74d3ab26793f24e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,17,253,93,101,27,185,106,59,145,16,174,231,77,58,178,103,147,242,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
