He would be completely normal if he didn't live in a sprawling graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor of the dead.\n\nThere are dangers and adventures in the graveyard for a boy. But if Bod leaves the graveyard, then he will come under attack from the man Jack - who has already killed Bod's family.\n\n(Music by Bela Fleck)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc8867232acbf221dc3857e313fb48a2af7aa6e5","amp;dn":"Neil+Gaiman+-+The+Graveyard+Book+%28Unabridged%29+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc8867232acbf221dc3857e313fb48a2af7aa6e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,136,103,35,42,203,242,33,220,56,87,227,19,251,72,162,175,122,166,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
