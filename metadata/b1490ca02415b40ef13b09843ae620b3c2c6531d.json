A must-see for yoga practitioners of all levels and a compelling viewing experience for anyone interested in understanding their own body.\n\nOverview\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s In Your Bones\n\nAn invaluable resource for both yoga students and teachers, this comprehensive DVD includes nearly 4 hours of in-depth lectures, demonstrations and special features on human anatomy as it relates to yoga practice. The focus of the DVD is comparative skeletal anatomy: understanding the underlying skeletal structure of the body, how the shapes and sizes of the bones differ from person to person, and how to use that knowledge in gaining a much deeper understanding of our individual yoga practices.\n\nPaul Grilley explains the key concepts of compression, tension, proportion and orientation with the help of a wide range of yoga students. These concepts help us to understand why no two people will ever experience the same yoga posture in exactly the same way. PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s light-hearted yet provocative approach will challenge many misconceptions about yoga while providing the foundation for the development of a truly personal yoga practice grounded in safety and respect.\n\nDetails\n\nHighlights from this DVD include:\n\n-Nearly 4 hours of presentations, comparisons and special features\n-Interactive Skeleton feature as an anatomy study aid\n-Bonus lecture: differences among real human femur bones\n-Q&amp;A: real yoga teachers ask Paul common questions about anatomy and yoga\n\nAnatomy presentation topics include:\n\n-Tension vs. Compression\n-The Eight Major Joints of the Body: an overview using comparative anatomy\n-The Shoulder vs. the Spine\n-The Femur and the Pelvis\n-The Importance of Skeletal Proportion\n-Orientation to Gravity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1490ca02415b40ef13b09843ae620b3c2c6531d","amp;dn":"Anatomy+for+Yoga+with+Paul+Grilley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1490ca02415b40ef13b09843ae620b3c2c6531d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,73,12,160,36,21,180,14,241,59,9,132,58,230,32,179,194,198,83,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
