White\nPublisher: Auerbach Publications\nDate: 2012\nPages: 307\nFormat: PDF\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1420074172\nISBN-13: 978-1420074178\nSize: 3.04 MB\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupplying a clear vision of how to build high-performance teams, Leadership in Chaordic Organizations presents methods for improving operations through the application of complex systems engineering principles and psychological counseling techniques. Ideal for systems engineers, organizational managers, coaches, and psychologists, it addresses the fundamental issue of the human condition in systems development.\n\nThe book considers the dynamic variables inherent in the human condition and how they impact group dynamics. Helping you to demystify complex system behaviors, it details an approach to leadership that integrates elements of neurobiology, systems engineering, complexity science, philosophy, and evolutionary and social psychology. It defines complexity and its impact on the organization and also explains how conflict can actually be constructive in group settings. Sharing helpful tips on how to build trust in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s environment, the book also:\n\n* Describes how the human condition affects group dynamics\n* Lays out current problems and outlines workable solutions\n* Shares a new vision of high-performance teams\n* Illuminates theory with applications\n\nIllustrating what teams and collaborative groups look like in a decentralized environment, the text introduces a highly effective group communications process invented by Richard KnowlesÃ¢â‚¬â€describing its use in designing 3D Immersive Learning Environments that enable complex emergence in dynamic interactive simulations. It also discusses complex human systems (Wicked Problems) and the potential of multi-user virtual environments to provide the transformative vision needed to fully engage all employees in your drive to make your organization more effective, efficient, and sustainable.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor this book, Beverly Gay McCarter, and Brian E. White have gathered, organized, and interpreted an immense amount of information. They bring together the thinking from chaos and complexity theory, psychology, neuro-linguistic programming, and neuroscience, helping readers better understand the nature and challenges of leadership...\n--Richard N.
