(Only I'm The Fool has a noise in the background)\nAll songs are great!\nEspecialy I loved new version of Water of Love, powerful Calling Elvis and Cannibals. Also very good versions of Brothers In Arms, Golden Heart and Telegraph Road.\n\nThere is also a new song from 1990 - The Long Highway.\nI recommend this show VERY MUCH!&quot; - Knopfler Live \n\nThis torrent contains all 3 Discs of the bootleg, taken from a FLAC copy off the soundboard directly and cleaned up a bit as well for maximum quality. It sounds fantastic IMHO. The files were converted using dbPoweramp. Each disc has a playlist as well that was generated with Mp3tag. The front and back cover image are also included. Thanks to the master source for the original lossless copy. Please seed, and enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691280e3fe6f45a097a0f425b8a729737eb31d9f","amp;dn":"Mark+Knopfler+-+Live+in+Vaison+%5B08-03-1996%5D+%283CD-MP3-320kbps%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691280e3fe6f45a097a0f425b8a729737eb31d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,18,128,227,254,111,69,160,151,160,244,37,184,167,41,115,126,179,29,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
