Released as a stop-gap between studio albums whilst the band were experiencing contractual difficulties, the compilation includes all seven of the Visage singles released up to that point (five of them top 40 hits) as well as three non-single tracks. The album reached no.38 in the UK album chart, but was certified Gold by the BPI based on pre-release sales to shops. A limited number of copies of the vinyl album were issued with a free 7&quot; vinyl picture disc of the &quot;Pleasure Boys&quot; single (1982), where as the cassette version of the album featured remixes of each of the tracks.\n\nThe album was rereleased a decade later as &quot;The Best Of Visage&quot; with a similar cover and track listing but with the inclusion of two tracks not featured on the original release; &quot;Love Glove&quot; (one of Visage&amp;#039;s last singles from 1984) and the Bassheads/Andy Stevenson remix of their seminal hit &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; which had been a minor top 40 hit again in 1993. The only single not to feature on this compilation was &quot;Beat Boy&quot;, the band&amp;#039;s final single from 1984.\n\nTrack Listing\n01 - Fade To Grey\n02 - Mind Of A Toy\n03 - Visage\n04 - We Move (1983 remix by John Hudson)\n05 - Tar\n06 - In The Year 2525\n07 - The Anvil (single remix by John Luongo)\n08 - Night Train (single mix)\n09 - Pleasure Boys (single remix by John Luongo)\n10 - The Damned Don&amp;#039;t Cry\n11 - Love Glove\n12 - Fade To Grey (Bassheads 7&quot; edit)\n\nAll tracks are DRM-free and encoded losslessly in FLAC format (16 bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz).
