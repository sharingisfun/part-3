This book examines the potential of advanced materials as well as nanotechnology to improve fiber science from fibril to fabric mode, to create better materials and products for a variety of aspects.\n\n\n\nThe book presents research advances in materials behavior using fractal analysis, mathematical modeling and simulation, and other methods. Examined are electrical, mechanical, optical, and magnetic properties; size; morphology; and chemical behavior of such materials as aerogels, polymer films, nanocomposite materials, natural composites, catalysis, and more with a view to their application in the medical, engineering, and textile fields.\n\n\n\nWith chapters written by eminent scientists, the book offers valuable information for academics, researchers, and engineering professionals. Contributions range from new methods to novel applications of existing methods to gain understanding of the material and/or structural behavior of new and advanced systems. A combined theoretical and technical approach is utilized to illuminate the concept of advanced material for diverse application to electronic devices, medical implants, energy transducers, sensors and actuators, and more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3beb4d6f5e6acdd1e17f475b64f307d165b9fb4c","amp;dn":"Materials+Behavior+-+Research+Methodology+and+Mathematical+Model","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3beb4d6f5e6acdd1e17f475b64f307d165b9fb4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,235,77,111,94,106,205,209,225,127,71,91,100,243,7,209,101,185,251,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
