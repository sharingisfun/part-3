She grew accustomed to working in large batches since most Ã¢â‚¬Å“vintageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recipes are written to feed a large family, or to use up a farm-size crop, but increasingly, found that smaller batches suited her life better. Working with a quart, a pound, a pint, or a bunch of produce, not a bushel, allows for dabbling in preserving without committing a whole shelf to storing a single type of jam.\n\nPreserving by the Pint is meant to be a guide for saving smaller batches from farmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s markets and produce standsÃ¢â‚¬â€preserving tricks for stopping time in a jar. McClellanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recipes offer tastes of unusual preserves like Blueberry Maple Jam, Mustardy Rhubarb Chutney, Sorrel Pesto, and Zucchini Bread and Butter Pickles. Organized seasonally, these pestos, sauces, mostardas, chutneys, butters, jams, jellies, and pickles are speedy, too: some take under an hour, leaving you more time to plan your next batch.\n\nAbout the Author\nMarisa McClellan is a food writer, canning teacher, and dedicated farmers' market shopper who lives in Center City Philadelphia with her husband Scott McNulty. She's the author of the blog Food in Jars and spends most of her days cooking up jams, fruit butters and pickles in her 80 square foot kitchen. Food in Jars: Preserving in Small Batches All Year Long is her very first cookbook.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fca994931011c934ba079e510d9457c017b629d","amp;dn":"Preserving+by+the+Pint+-+Quick+Seasonal+Canning+for+Small+Spaces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fca994931011c934ba079e510d9457c017b629d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,202,153,73,49,1,28,147,75,160,121,229,16,217,69,124,1,123,98,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
