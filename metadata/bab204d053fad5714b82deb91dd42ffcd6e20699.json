A small number of players reported that the game felt twitchy and Abe was slightly unpredictable, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re confident this is because the deadzones on analog sticks were too small, making the game think the sticks were being moved when they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. \n\nIf you experienced this, please adjust the deadzone with the new slider which can be found in the settings. \n\n\nÃ¢Å¾ï¿½  / Grey screen on boot \n\nIf the player didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a language selected in Steam, the game didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always boot, instead presenting the player with a grey screen. The game will now force a default language, preventing the issue. \n\nÃ¢Å¾â€š  / Logitech F310, F510 and F710 controller support \n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re aware that a number of players like to use Logitech F310, F510 and F710 controllers. This patch should allow these controllers to be used in Oddworld: New Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Tasty. Please let us know how you get on with this. \n\nÃ¢Å¾Æ’ / XInput support \n\nFinally, to expand the number of supported controllers, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now an XInput checkbox in the Settings menu that should allow players to use officially supported Microsoft XInput devices","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab204d053fad5714b82deb91dd42ffcd6e20699","amp;dn":"Oddworld+New+N+Tasty+%28Patch+1.01%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab204d053fad5714b82deb91dd42ffcd6e20699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,178,4,208,83,250,213,113,75,130,222,185,29,212,47,252,214,226,6,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
