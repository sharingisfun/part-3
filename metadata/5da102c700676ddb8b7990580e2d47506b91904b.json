Several of his works, notably his novels Satantango (SÃƒÂ¡tÃƒÂ¡ntangÃƒÂ³) (1985) and The Melancholy of Resistance (Az ellenÃƒÂ¡llÃƒÂ¡s melankÃƒÂ³liÃƒÂ¡ja) (1989) have been turned into feature films by Hungarian film director BÃƒÂ©la Tarr. Krasznahorkai has been honoured with numerous literary prizes, among them the highest award of the Hungarian state, the Kossuth Prize.\n\nKrasznahorkai's works have had a limited audience outside of Hungary and Germany. Only with recent translations of Satantango, The Melancholy of Resistance, War and War, Seiobo There Below, as well as Animalinside (a collaboration with artist Max Neumann) in English by George Szirtes and Ottilie Mulzet and published by New Directions has his work received critical notice in the United States. Further, because BÃƒÂ©la Tarr's films are limited in distribution and seen as experimental and intellectually opaque, his impact on film has not received much popular notice.\n\nIn 1993, his novel The Melancholy of Resistance received the German Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bestenliste-PrizeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for the best literary work of the year. From the United States to Japan, critics have acknowledged the importance of his writing. According to Susan Sontag, he is Ã¢â‚¬Å“the contemporary Hungarian master of apocalypse who inspires comparison with Gogol and MelvilleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. W. G. Sebald had this to say: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The universality of Krasznahorkai's vision rivals that of Gogol's Dead Souls and far surpasses all the lesser concerns of contemporary writing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In 1996, he was a guest of the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin. While completing the novel War and War, he travelled widely across Europe. The American poet Allen Ginsberg was of great assistance in completing the work; Krasznahorkai resided for some time in GinsbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New York apartment, and the poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friendly advice was invaluable in bringing the book to life.\n\n\nThe torrent contains following books:\n\n*  Satantango, 1985 -- ePUB + Mobi\n\n*  The Melancholy of Resistance, 1989 -- ePUB + Mobi\n\n*  War &amp; War, 1999 -- ePUB\n\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Krasznahorkai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Krasznahorkai&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/laszlo-krasznahorkai-interview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/laszlo-krasznahorkai-interview&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2011/07/04/110704crat_atlarge_wood&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2011/07/04/110704crat_atlarge_wood&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thewhitereview.org/interviews/interview-with-laszlo-krasznahorkai/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thewhitereview.org/interviews/interview-with-laszlo-krasznahorkai/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musicandliterature.org/features/2013/12/11/a-conversation-with-lszl-krasznahorkai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musicandliterature.org/features/2013/12/11/a-conversation-with-lszl-krasznahorkai&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5da102c700676ddb8b7990580e2d47506b91904b","amp;dn":"Laszlo+Krasznahorkai+-+Hungarian+Author++%283+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5da102c700676ddb8b7990580e2d47506b91904b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,161,2,199,0,103,109,219,139,121,144,88,14,45,71,80,107,145,144,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
