Along with fellow Atlanta rappers OutKast, Goodie Mob laid out the blueprint for the Dirty South style during the mid-'90s, making serious waves with their debut album, Soul Food (1995). Cee Lo was an important member of the group, often singing the hooks to many of Goodie Mob's best songs (e.g., &quot;Cell Therapy,&quot; &quot;Soul Food,&quot; &quot;Black Ice&quot;). But the group didn't last too long, and after a few releases over a five-year span, Cee Lo split with Goodie Mob for a promising solo deal with Arista. \n\n\nGenre................: Rap\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2002-2012\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n2002 - Cee-Lo Green And His Perfect Imperfections\n\n01.Bad Mutha\n02.Close Encounter (Break)\n03.Big Ole Words (Damn)\n04.Closet Freak (Feat.
