The term also refers to the associated dance styles and fashions that emanated from the Twisted Wheel club in Manchester and spread to other dancehalls and nightclubs, such as the Golden Torch (in Stoke-upon-Trent), the Highland Rooms at the Blackpool Mecca and the Wigan Casino. Northern soul dancing was usually athletic, resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, and backdrops, the northern soul dancing style was inspired by the stage performances of visiting American soul acts.\nI have been on the Northern Soul scene for many years as Promoter, Dj and total freak. And thought it was about time to put a bit back into the scene that causes me to have so many memories and so many sleepless nights.\nThis torrent is compiled by me and ripped by myself and other friends on the scene ( Thanks alot guys ~ Keep the Faith ). Although it was bloody hard putting these together I cant begin to tell ya the fun I had and the memories it brought back playing some of these for the first time in a while.  I was asked to put together a series of torrents concerning the different types of Northern Soul eg Blackpool Mecca,The Ritz,Instrumentals,The Torch,Twisted Wheel, my particular fave which is Cleethorpes etc etc So this I have done and I have made this one extra. Its the Northern I would choose if I couldnt listen to another track but these! Its full of the rarest of the rare as well as the ones you all probably know and love.\nThese tracks were ripped by me and friends on the scene ( thanks alot guys ~ Keep the Faith ) and painstakingly compiled and put out there for you all to enjoy. I hope there is a few you like lol and if I missed your particular fave then check out my other torrents and see if it is on them. Send me a msg if not as Im still in the process of making more!!! Enjoy guys.\nunionjack ~ Soul as deep as you like and some.\nPS see ya at the St Ives Anniversarry!!!!
