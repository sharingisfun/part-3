The advent of faster-than-light travel has opened up hundreds of habitable planets for colonization, and humans have exploited the virtually limitless space and resources for hundreds of years with impunity.\n\nSo complacent have they become with the overabundance that armed conflict is a thing of the past, and their machines of war are obsolete and decrepit. What would happen if they were suddenly threatened by a terrifying new enemy? Would humanity fold and surrender, or would they return to their evolutionary roots and meet force with force? One shipÃ¢â‚¬â€and one captainÃ¢â‚¬â€will soon be faced with this very choice.\n\nAgainst incredible odds, Jackson Wolfe is determined to save humanityÃ¢â‚¬â€œand in the process, might end up saving himself. \n\n\nRead by Mark Boyett\nLength: 8 hrs and 20 mins \nFormat: M4B\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac38a5d17cee160bba3f1b9f6322646b08ec33f","amp;dn":"Joshua+Dalzelle+-+Warship+%28Black+Fleet+Trilogy+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac38a5d17cee160bba3f1b9f6322646b08ec33f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,195,138,93,23,206,225,96,187,163,241,185,246,50,38,70,176,142,195,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
