The SRU are tasked to resolve extreme situations that regular officers are not trained to handle including hostage-taking, bomb threats and heavily armed criminals. Equipped with high-tech tools and a cache of weapons and explosives, members use negotiation tactics and intuition to try to avoid the use of force.\n\n\nEpiosde order\n\nThe order of episodes seems to be a kind of confusing matter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ so I post the link to the current episode order listed by CTV on their site at present.\n\nCTV's List of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://shows.ctv.ca/FlashPoint/Episodes.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://shows.ctv.ca/FlashPoint/Episodes.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSeason 4\n\nIt looks like there is going to be a fourth season. 18 episodes had been  ordered just before season three started airing and are already in production. They will air on CTV in Canada in their regular midseason timeslot.\nIn the US, CBS will show the missing episodes of season 3 and the first seven episodes of season 4 in summer 2011.
