His follow-up, No Hero, offers a rare counterpoint: an account of OwenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most personally meaningful missions, missions that never made headlines, including the moments in which he learned the most about himself and his teammates in both success and failure.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I want No Hero to offer something most books on war donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t: the intimate side of it, the personal struggles and hardships and what I learned from them,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Owen. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The stories in No Hero are a testament to my teammates and to all the other active and former SEALs who have dedicated their lives to freedom. In our community, we are constantly taught to mentor the younger generation and to pass the lessons and values weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned on to others so that they can do the same for the guys coming up after them. This is what I hope I have done for readers of No Hero.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEvery bit as action-packed as No Easy Day, and featuring stories from the training ground to the battlefield, No Hero offers readers a never-before-seen close-up view of the experiences and values that make Mark Owen and the SEALs he served with capable of executing the missions we read about in the headlines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a6058335c6c0268090c50f6bf48430e61dd3ec0","amp;dn":"No+Hero%3A+The+Evolution+of+a+Navy+SEAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a6058335c6c0268090c50f6bf48430e61dd3ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,96,88,51,92,108,2,104,9,12,80,246,191,72,67,14,97,221,62,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
