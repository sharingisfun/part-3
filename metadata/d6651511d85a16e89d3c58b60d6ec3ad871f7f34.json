Supported by a wide selection of archive photographs and drawing on the testimony of those who took part, this new edition covers both the famous battle sites, such as High Wood and Mametz Wood and lesser known villages on the outlying flanks. It includes a day-by-day account of the British build-up on the Somme and the ensuing struggle, British and German orders of battle and a full history of the cemeteries and memorials, both &quot;lost&quot; and current, that sprang up in the years following the First World War. The author also provides thumbnail biographies of all the senior officers to fall, as well as the winners of the Victoria Cross and those who were &quot;shot at dawn.&quot; Somme 1916 is essential reading for anyone interested in the First World War","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6651511d85a16e89d3c58b60d6ec3ad871f7f34","amp;dn":"Somme+1916%3A+A+Battlefield+Companion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6651511d85a16e89d3c58b60d6ec3ad871f7f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,101,21,17,216,90,22,232,157,60,88,182,13,110,195,173,135,31,127,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
