On the other hand, Tenshi nicknamed Angel, the chairperson of the student council for the world after death, harnesses supernatural powers against the SSS members.\n\nWhat is this strange world in limbo, where no one ages or dies? Why do some students simply vanish? What role does the seemingly violent Angel play, and what are the SSS' goals? The recently deceased Otonashi Yuzuru is looking for the answers...\n\nNote: The first episode was pre-aired during a special event for the Angel Beats multimedia project, held in Tokyo on March 22, 2010 to a selected number of lucky first-time viewers, who were chosen from a nationwide postcard lottery held until March 12.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80142460e82bd946317eb74a8dc46ce4948bba4","amp;dn":"%5BUTW%5D+Angel+Beats%21+%5BBD%5D%5Bh264-1080p+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80142460e82bd946317eb74a8dc46ce4948bba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,1,66,70,14,130,189,148,99,23,235,116,168,220,70,206,73,72,187,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
