Have you hit a brick wall in your training and physique, where you're not seeing additional gains by increasing the amount of work you're doing in the gym? \n\nMuscle &amp; Fitness shows you how to get fast results in a fraction of the time. Traditional training is based upon increasing training volume - increasing the reps, sets and training frequency - to see continued improvements in your physique and performance. However, unless you have time to live in the gym or you're a professional athlete, few people can consistently set aside that kind of time to training. Instead, following the scientifically proven method of high-intensity training and high-intensity interval cardio training, you can build more muscle and strength, and burn more fat than you ever thought possible...and you don't have to end up living at the gym in the process. \n\nIn 101 High Intensity Workouts, David Barr, Muscle &amp; Fitness magazine Exercise Science Writer, and Joe Wuebben, Muscle &amp; Fitness Senior Editor, provide a lifetime of workouts to ensure you never get bored, but continually increase lean muscle mass and reduce body fat using this scientifically proven training method of short, high-intensity bouts of training.\n\nAimed towards anyone tired of spending countless hours training with weights and doing cardio and without seeing additional gains, 101 High-Intensity Workouts For Fast Results provides a lifetime of workouts that continually increase lean muscle mass and reduce body fat using scientifically proven methods of short, high-intensity bouts of training.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b1d61de37841e5e32d19bca4025c40fd2b7d6e","amp;dn":"101+High+Intensity+Workouts+For+Fast+Results+%28101+Workouts%29+By+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b1d61de37841e5e32d19bca4025c40fd2b7d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,177,214,29,227,120,65,229,227,45,25,188,164,2,92,64,253,43,125,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
