Of interest as well was that the book did not solely focus on Stalingrad but on the battles leading up to it (Including Mansteins fight in the Crimea) as well as the battles that happened immediately after Stalingrad, the Soviets breaking the encirclement of Leningrad and their ill fated Operation Star followed by Manstein's Counterstroke. All of this backed up with great pictures and paintings makes for a great read.&quot;\n\nGoodreads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fea221978fa8cdc012580bd308fde49b9a40e79","amp;dn":"The+Road+to+Stalingrad+-+3rd+Reich+Series+%28History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fea221978fa8cdc012580bd308fde49b9a40e79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,234,34,25,120,250,140,220,1,37,128,189,48,143,222,73,185,164,14,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
