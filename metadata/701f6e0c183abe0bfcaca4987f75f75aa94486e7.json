Took me a lot of work to put this together and I just had to share it. Let me know if there is a problem with the trackers or anything.\n\n\nIf you're a photographer (an enthusiast or a pro), you'll eventually be asked to photograph a wedding: a task that's both a privilege and a challenge. You're capturing one of life's most significant milestones. You're shooting an event filled with unpredictable moments that can't be re-created, and you need to be involved without being intrusive. It's a balancing act that professional wedding photographers work hard to perfect.\n\nChris Orwig has been in exactly this position, and in this course, he shares his experiences and creative insights, all liberally illustrated with examples from weddings that he has photographed. The course begins with details on preproductionÃ¢â‚¬â€your gear and equipment decisions and the importance of talking to the bride and groom about their goals for your photographs. It also explores some key strategies for documenting the ceremony and the celebration afterwards. Lastly, Chris reviews some postproduction strategies for enhancing your images and delivering them to the happy couple. \n\n\nPLEASE SEED  I AM ONLY ABLE TO SEED FOR ABOUT 6 WEEKS\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:701f6e0c183abe0bfcaca4987f75f75aa94486e7","amp;dn":"Lynda+Wedding+Photography+for+Everyone+Fundamentals+with+Chris+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"701f6e0c183abe0bfcaca4987f75f75aa94486e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,31,110,12,24,58,190,11,252,172,164,152,127,117,247,90,169,68,134,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
