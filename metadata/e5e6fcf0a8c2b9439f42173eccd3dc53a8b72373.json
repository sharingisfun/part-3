Guitarist Tom Morello is one of the most distinctive and innovative players of his era, and his foil, vocalist/lyricist Zack De La Rocha, is as unrelenting and inspiring as ever on The Battle of Los Angeles. Rage, whose past antics include performing naked with duct tape over their mouths to protest censorship, released Battle on Election Day, but the politics of the group can be separated from the sounds. Indeed, the 45 minutes of mayhem heard here can be enjoyed solely as rousing aggro hip-hop rock. There's more variety found on Battle than on its predecessors, however. &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot; is one of their most straight-ahead rock tunes. The trippy guitar on &quot;Calm Like a Bomb&quot; is out there even for the adventurous Morello. And &quot;Born a Broken Man&quot; serves up lovely musical interludes. Overall, the more finely honed Rage heard on Battle may not inspire a generation of young revolutionaries, but they still stir up more mutinous spirit than the rest of the current rock pack. --Katherine Turman\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Testify                                              [03:30]\n02.Guerrilla radio                                      [03:26]\n03.Calm like A bomb                                     [04:59]\n04.Mic check                                            [03:34]\n05.Sleep now in the fire                                [03:26]\n06.Born of A broken man                                 [04:41]\n07.Born as ghosts                                       [03:22]\n08.Maria                                                [03:48]\n09.Voice of the voiceless                               [02:32]\n10.New millennium homes                                 [03:45]\n11.Ashes in the fall                                    [04:37]\n12.War within A breath                                  [03:37]\n________\n45:17 min\n 72,6 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
