Excellent performances in \n                this study of two turbulent characters set against realistic and \n                cynical Hollywood backdrop. Written by Andrew Solt. (Review from \n                &amp;#039;Leonard Maltin&amp;#039;s Movie Guide&amp;#039;)\n\n\t\tAlthough not as well known as his other work, Bogart&amp;#039;s performance \n                in this film is considered by many critics to be among his finest \n                and the film&amp;#039;s reputation itself has grown over time along with \n                Ray&amp;#039;s. The film is now considered a classic film noir, as evidenced \n                by its inclusion on the Time Magazine All-Time \t100 List.
