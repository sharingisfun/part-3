A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.\n\nSky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t at all who heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been claiming to be. When the secrets heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of SkyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life will change forever.\n\nLosing Hope (Hopeless #2) by Colleen Hoover (July 8th 2013)\n\nIn Hopeless, Sky left no secret unearthed, no feeling unshared, and no memory forgotten, but HolderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past remained a mystery.\n\nStill haunted by the little girl he let walk away, Holder has spent his entire life searching for her in an attempt to finally rid himself of the crushing guilt he has felt for years. But he could not have anticipated that the moment they reconnect, even greater remorse would overwhelm himÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nSometimes in life, if we wish to move forward, we must first dig deep into our past and make amends. In Losing Hope, bestselling author Colleen Hoover reveals what was going on inside HolderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head during all those hopeless momentsÃ¢â‚¬â€and whether he can gain the peace he desperately needs.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b8e2a0ade24ac625353ef4b457d23c7b8dbf4b6","amp;dn":"Hopeless+Series+%281-2%29+by+Colleen+Hoover+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b8e2a0ade24ac625353ef4b457d23c7b8dbf4b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,142,42,10,222,36,172,98,83,83,239,75,69,125,35,199,184,219,244,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
