Seventeen Ã‚Â­year-old Mia has no memory of the accident; she can only recall what happened afterwards, watching her own damaged body being taken from the wreck. Little by little she struggles to put together the pieces- to figure out what she has lost, what she has left, and the very difficult choice she must make. Heartwrenchingly beautiful, Mia's story will stay with you for a long, long time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc31285edd3853c25d7b0c32eb130441efb50713","amp;dn":"If+I+Stay+by+Gayle+Forman+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc31285edd3853c25d7b0c32eb130441efb50713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,49,40,94,221,56,83,194,93,123,12,50,235,19,4,65,239,181,7,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
