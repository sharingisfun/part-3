Nicholson, in one of his finest performances, plays David Locke, a disillusioned American reporter who is sent on a grueling mission to North Africa. When he stumbles across the body of a dead man in his hotel room, Locke, long desirous of starting life over again, assumes the corpse&amp;#039;s identity. He soon discovers that the man he&amp;#039;s pretending to be is involved in espionage activities on behalf of a terrorist group. Making the acquaintance of a mysterious woman, he finds a kindred spirit -- a woman as &quot;lost&quot; as he.\n-AMG Review\n\n\nIncluded are audio commentary by journalist Aurora Irvine and screenwriter Mark Peploe plus audio commentary by Jack Nicholson\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99dbaf816f976b53837588cea08d3417bf2f5f21","amp;dn":"Michelangelo+Antonioni+-+Professione+Reporter+%281975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99dbaf816f976b53837588cea08d3417bf2f5f21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,219,175,129,111,151,107,83,131,117,136,206,160,141,52,23,191,47,95,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
