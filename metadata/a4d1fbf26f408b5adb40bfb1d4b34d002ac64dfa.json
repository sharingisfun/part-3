This course is your primer. Get the tools you need, learn the structure of Objective-C, and get your first code up and running. Author Simon Allardice also walks you through the Foundation framework, a collection of prewritten code that makes the coding process easier; shows you how to design and build your own classes; and provides memory management techniquesÃ¢â‚¬â€the key to efficient programming. Plus, learn how to make your way around Xcode 5, the app to write, test, and debug Objective-C, and into advanced features like categories, protocols, and dynamic typing.\nTopics include:\nInstalling the tools\nUnderstanding the structure of an Objective-C program\nLogging messages and using format strings\nWriting conditional code\nUsing code snippets\nWorking with variables, classes, and functions\nWorking with objects\nUsing existing classes in the Foundation framework\nManaging memory usage\nCreating custom classes\nWorking with Objective-C collections\nReading and writing to files\nUnderstanding inheritance and NSObject\nUsing Categories, Protocols, and Class Extensions\nCompiling and debugging code\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lynda.com/Objective-C-tutorials/Objective-C-Essential-Training/143328-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lynda.com/Objective-C-tutorials/Objective-C-Essential-Training/143328-2.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4d1fbf26f408b5adb40bfb1d4b34d002ac64dfa","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Objective+C+Essential+Training+%28Dec+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4d1fbf26f408b5adb40bfb1d4b34d002ac64dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,209,251,242,111,64,139,90,219,64,191,177,212,179,77,0,42,198,77,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
