And on the dirty city streets below, Homicide Detective Christian Walker does his job. Detective Christian Walker is a special homicide officer in charge of cases that involve...Powers. What is a cop's job like in a world where Powers are par for the course? And what kind of cop is given the assignment? Find out in the gritty, new crime comic book series Powers from super hot comic writer and EISNER award winner Brian Michael Bendis (Sam And Twitch, Daredevil, Jinx, Batman) and art deco comic artist Mike Avon Oeming (Young Justice, Superman).
