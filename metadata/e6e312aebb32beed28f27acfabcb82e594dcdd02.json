Its one mission is to track, find, and kill those so dangerous to the United States that they are on a short document known as the Kill List. TOSA actually exists. So does the Kill List.\n\nAdded to it is a new name: a terrorist of frightening effectiveness called the Preacher, who radicalizes young Muslims abroad to carry out assassinations. Unfortunately for him, one of the kills is a retired Marine general, whose son is TOSAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top hunter of men.\n\nHe has spent the last six years at his job. He knows nothing about his targetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name, face, or location. He realizes his search will take him to places where few could survive. But the Preacher has made it personal now. The hunt is on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e312aebb32beed28f27acfabcb82e594dcdd02","amp;dn":"The+Kill+List+-+Frederick+Forsyth.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e312aebb32beed28f27acfabcb82e594dcdd02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,227,18,174,187,50,190,237,40,242,122,207,171,203,130,229,148,220,221,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
