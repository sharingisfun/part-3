As various beasts, bugs, fish, and fowl appear,a soft-spoken narrator pinpoints behaviors that mirror human ones, often inventing whimsical tales meant to inspire chuckles or sighs. A male wart hog, a homely bachelor, lands a wife with a penchant for redecorating his burrow; austere maribou glower like disapproving undertakers; a billowy, nameless fish is called a dizzy blonde. Uyss respect for the harsh lifestyle these creatures endure clearly displays itself amid the comical sound effects and Fantasia-lite melodies that infuse the 90-minute show. The result: a richly informative, beautifully filmed lesson in the power of adaptation and the lush wildlife that inhabits the cradle of civilization. Six years after completing this project, Uys went on to create The Gods Must Be Crazy. (Ages 5 and older) \n**Liane Thomas ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:239e8dcc54264ab72c56adfea09cad2bae611511","amp;dn":"Animals+Are+Beautiful+People+%281974%29+XVID+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"239e8dcc54264ab72c56adfea09cad2bae611511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,158,141,204,84,38,74,183,44,86,173,254,160,156,173,43,174,97,21,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
