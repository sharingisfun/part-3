Unfortunately, rather than a starting point, this album proved to be their ultimate peak. It included the title track, 'The Message' frequently referred to as the greatest record in Hip-Hop history\n\nTracklist:\n\n                1. \t&quot;She's Fresh&quot;   4:57\n                2. \t&quot;It's Nasty&quot;    4:19\n                3. \t&quot;Scorpio&quot;       4:55\n                4. \t&quot;It's a Shame&quot;  4:57\n                5. \t&quot;Dreamin'&quot;      5:47\n                6. \t&quot;You Are&quot;       4:51\n                7. \t&quot;The Message&quot;   7:12\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3850278343a4a880f129c5095b680c2b3e26e455","amp;dn":"Grandmaster+Flash+and+The+Furious+Five+-+The+Message","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3850278343a4a880f129c5095b680c2b3e26e455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,80,39,131,67,164,168,128,241,41,197,9,91,104,12,43,62,38,228,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
