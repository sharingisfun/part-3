Recorded near the end of Sinatraâ€™s career, it consists of electronically assembled duets between Sinatra and younger singers from various genres. The album was a commercial success, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard albums chart, reaching No. 5 in the UK, and selling over 3 million copies in the US. It is the only Sinatra album to date to achieve triple platinum certification.\r\n\r\nThe album received mixed critical notices, with complaints stemming from Sinatraâ€™s specified style of isolated performance wherein he was never joined by his duet partners in the studio, an artificial method of record production which lacked the elements of personal collaboration and spontaneity. The guest singers had been directed to sing along to his pre-recorded vocal parts, and to make their performances complement his.\r\n\r\nThe cover art displays a specially commissioned painting of Frank Sinatra by LeRoy Neiman. Its sequel, Duets II, was released the following year. Both albums were packaged together in a â€œ90th Birthday Limited Collectorâ€™s Editionâ€ released in 2005; North American pressings add an unreleased duet recording of â€œMy Wayâ€ with Willie Nelson, while international pressings have him singing with Luciano Pavarotti.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtist:Frank Sinatra\r\nTitle:Duets\r\nYear Of Release:1993\r\nLabel:Capitol Records\r\nGenre:Jazz, Easy listening\r\nQuality:WavPack (image+.cue): 32/192\r\nTotal Time:00:45:45\r\nTotal Size:2.29 GB\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Original Released Date: November 2, 1993\r\nâ€¢ DCC Released Date: 1994\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA1.
