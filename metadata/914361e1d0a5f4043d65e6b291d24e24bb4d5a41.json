With an almost unlimited range of input and output add-ons, sensors, indicators, displays, motors, and more, the Arduino offers you countless ways to create devices that interact with the world around you.\n\nIn Arduino Workshop, you will learn how these add-ons work and how to integrate them into your own projects. You will start off with an overview of the Arduino system but quickly move on to coverage of various electronic components and concepts. Hands-on projects throughout the book reinforce what you have learned and show you how to apply that knowledge. As your understanding grows, the projects increase in complexity and sophistication.\n\nAmong the books 65 projects are useful devices like:\n\nA digital thermometer that charts temperature changes on an LCD\nA GPS logger that records data from your travels, which can be displayed on Google Maps\nA handy tester that lets you check the voltage of any single-cell battery\nA keypad-controlled lock that requires a secret code to open\n\nYou will also learn to build Arduino toys and games like:\n\nAn electronic version of the classic six-sided die\nA binary quiz game that challenges your number conversion skills\nA motorized remote control tank with collision detection to keep it from crashing\n\nArduino Workshop will teach you the tricks and design principles of a master craftsman. Whatever your skill level, you will have fun as you learn to harness the power of the Arduino for your own DIY projects.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nChapter 1. Getting Started\nChapter 2.
