Thanks to all the uploaders who have taken the time to rip the actual discs and share the music. All the albums included were downloaded from public torrent sites around the web.\n\nAll albums have artwork included, and I tried to tag most of them to the individual song files in media monkey. When the albums are loaded into media monkey they will appear in numerical order under the album category. Media Monkey will recognize the tags in every album.\n\nI have tried to include what I considered to be the best available version of the material. Most are Remasters, when available I either used MFSL versions, vinyl rips, Japanese Imports (SHM CD's) some are vinyl rips, some are mono.\n\nI was as faithful to the actual RS list as I could be. The list can be found here... http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231\n\nIf the actual album was not used, it is because I could not locate the exact title that was listed.\n\nThe exceptions are, #027 Robert Johnson's King Of the Delta Blues. He only recorded 29 tracks so I included The Centenial Collection which has all of them. #053 is Ray Charles The Birth Of Soul Box Set, I included a 20 greatest hits album instead. #092 Buddy Holly 20 Golden Greats. I included the 3 disc Memorial Collection from 2008.\n\nAll other albums are the exact title that RS listed. I know there are a lot of opinions on the albums in the list, and where they were placed, either way its a lot of great music.\n\nI don't have the greatest upload speed, but will keep this going, until other people with better upload speeds can take over.\n\nI am going to continue to build the collection, and as I have the next 100 albums completed in my collection I will share them again. If anyone cares to share a link or upload a missing album, please include a link on the comment page. If anyone wants credit for a selection they know is theirs I will do my best to accomodate a thank you section THANKS A BUNCH TO ALL THE UPLOADERS WHO CONTINUE TO SHARE!!!!\n\nThe albums included...\n\n#001 Sgt.
