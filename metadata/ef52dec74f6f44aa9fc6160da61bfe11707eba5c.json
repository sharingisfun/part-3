It was founded in 2002 as a division of Headbangers Entertainment. The label is home to French electro acts Justice, SebastiAn, Uffie, Krazy Baldhead, DJ Mehdi, Mr Oizo, Mr Flash, Vicarious Bliss, So Me, Feadz, DSL and Winter himself, under the alias Busy P. All of the Ed Banger Records video and album art is coordinated by So Me.\n\nThe label enjoyed a dramatic rise in fame in early 2007 when a number of the artists signed to its roster enjoyed mainstream success, most notably French electro group Justice, whose rework of &quot;Never Be Alone&quot; by now defunct Electro-rock band Simian (members of which would later become Simian Mobile Disco), entered the UK charts at #20. The track was an unspoken success in clubs worldwide.[citation needed] The music video for the single won the award for best video at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006. Labelmate Uffie also enjoyed a rise in fame in late 2006 when her single, &quot;Pop the Glock&quot;, gained international radio play.\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef52dec74f6f44aa9fc6160da61bfe11707eba5c","amp;dn":"Ed+Banger+Records+Vol.+1-2-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef52dec74f6f44aa9fc6160da61bfe11707eba5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,82,222,199,79,111,68,170,159,198,22,13,166,27,254,17,112,126,186,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
