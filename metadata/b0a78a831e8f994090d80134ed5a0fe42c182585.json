It wasn't planned, but just kind of happened that way. It was a great experience to be able to bring a different sound to this album and I hope the fans love it as much as I do. \n\nCurrington taps into the amazing Nashville songwriter community for We Are Tonight, as well as, covering fellow surfer Jack Johnson s Banana Pancakes. The album features intimate moments like on 23 Degrees and South, youthful nostalgia on the title track We Are Tonight and a fun, playful side on It s Hard To Be A Hippie which features Willie Nelson. \n\nCurrington is a Grammy nominated and Platinum selling artist whose No. 1 singles include Don t, Good Directions, Let Me Down Easy, Must Be Doin Something Right, People Are Crazy, Pretty Good At Drinkin Beer and That s How Country Boys Roll.\n\n\n[i][b]click Dick  [/b][/i]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0a78a831e8f994090d80134ed5a0fe42c182585","amp;dn":"Billy+Currington+-+We+Are+Tonight+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0a78a831e8f994090d80134ed5a0fe42c182585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,167,138,131,30,143,153,64,144,216,1,52,237,90,15,228,44,24,37,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
