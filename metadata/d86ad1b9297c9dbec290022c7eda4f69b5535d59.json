Although their stay was brief the sophistication of the music recorded under the wing of prolific production and writing team Holland, Dozier, Holland later established them as one of Motown's finest and most influential acts. \nThis stomping 2CD Anthology chronicles all their early hits such as the club anthem 'This Old Heart Of Mine' which charted in US and UK as well 'I Guess I'll Always Love You', 'Put Yourself In My Place' a newly discovered unreleased track 'Sure Is A Whole Lotta Woman' as well as an array of B-Sides, alternative &amp; stereo mixes all restored from original mono LP tapes.\n\nDisc 1\n1.
