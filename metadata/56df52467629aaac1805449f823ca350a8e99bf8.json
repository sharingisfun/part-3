In this course, Paul F. Aubin teaches you the core building information modeling (BIM) techniques you need to complete solid architectural projects in Revit 2015. First, get comfortable with the Revit environment, and learn to set up a project and add the grids, levels, and dimensions that will anchor your design. Then get to modeling: adding walls, doors, and windows; creating and mirroring groups; linking to external assets and DWG files; and working with floors, roofs, and ceilings. Paul also shows advanced techniques for modeling stairs, complex walls, and partially obscured building elements, as well as adding rooms and solid geometry. Finally, discover how to annotate your drawing so all the components are perfectly understood, and learn how to output sheets to DWF, PDF, or AutoCAD.\nTopics include:\nWhat is BIM?\nUnderstanding Revit element hierarchy\nNavigating views\nCreating a new project from a template\nAdding walls, doors, and windows\nAdding plumbing fixtures and other components\nLinking AutoCAD DWG files\nRotating and aligning Revit links\nWorking with footprint and extrusion roofs\nAdding openings\nAdding railings and extensions to stairs\nCreating stacked and curtain walls\nHiding and isolating objects\nAdding rooms\nCreating schedule views and tags\nAdding text and dimensions\nCreating new families\nUsing reference planes, parameters, and constraints\nPlotting and creating a PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56df52467629aaac1805449f823ca350a8e99bf8","amp;dn":"Revit+Architecture+2015+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56df52467629aaac1805449f823ca350a8e99bf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,223,82,70,118,41,170,172,24,5,68,159,130,60,163,80,168,233,155,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
