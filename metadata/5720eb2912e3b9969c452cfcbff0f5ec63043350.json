It contains a workout programme designed to rapidly improve the size and strength of your chest, while also building bigger and stronger arms, shoulders, back and legs, and burning fat to reveal the results of all your hard work. Training your back will make your chest stronger, training your arms and shoulders will result in a desirable V-shape torso, and training your legs releases growth hormone, which promotes the building of new lean muscle mass and instructs your body to burn fat. So not only will you have an amazing chest after just eight weeks, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have new lean muscle mass everywhere else too. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5720eb2912e3b9969c452cfcbff0f5ec63043350","amp;dn":"Mens+Fitness+Magbook+-+Build+A+Bigger+Chest++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5720eb2912e3b9969c452cfcbff0f5ec63043350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,32,235,41,18,227,185,150,156,69,44,252,191,240,245,236,99,4,51,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
