Two definitions of the photon density in the rate equations and two definitions of the phase-shift in the phase-shifted DFB-LD are explained, and differences in the calculated results are indicated, depending on the definitions.\n\nReaders can understand the physics of semiconductor lasers and analytical tools for Fabry-Perot LDs, DFB-LDs, and VCSELs and will be stimulated to develop semiconductor lasers themselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa79db2c1274929e3afe71fcc04c6b00194d6dd","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Semiconductor+Lasers+2nd+Edition+%5B2015%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa79db2c1274929e3afe71fcc04c6b00194d6dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,167,157,178,193,39,73,41,227,175,231,31,204,4,198,176,1,148,214,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
