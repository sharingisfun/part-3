Visual Basic 2012 How to Program, Sixth Edition is also appropriate for anyone interested in learning programming with Visual Basic 2012.\n\nCreated by world-renowned programming instructors Paul and Harvey Deitel, Visual Basic 2012 How to Program, SixthÃ‚Â¿Edition introduces all facets of the Visual Basic 2012 language through a hands-on approach with hundreds of working programs. This book has been thoroughly updated to reflect the major innovations Microsoft has incorporated in Visual Basic 2012; all discussions and sample code have been carefully audited against the newest Visual Basic language specification. The Sixth Edition is updated to Visual Studio 2012 and includes new chapters on Windows 8 UI app development, Windows 8 graphics/multimedia, Windows Phone 8 app development and Windows Azure.\n\nReaders begin by getting comfortable with the free Visual Basic Express 2012 IDE and basic VB syntax. Next, they build their skills one step at a time, mastering control structures, classes, objects, methods, variables, arrays, and the core techniques of object-oriented programming. With this strong foundation in place, the Deitels introduce more sophisticated techniques, including inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, strings, GUI's, data structures, generics, and collections. Throughout, the authors show developers how to make the most of MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Visual Studio tools. A series of appendices provide essential programming reference material on various topics.\n\nPaperback: 696 pages\nPublisher: Prentice Hall; 6 edition (May 11, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0133406954\nISBN-13: 978-0133406955\n\nThis book is currently separated into html pages by chapter for now.  I was having trouble converting some of the images into pdfs so I left them the way I ripped them. I also included the code examples for chapters 1-15.  Chapter's 16-31 aren't included as I couldn't find them anywhere, however most professor's don't use them.\n\nSeed and Enjoy   \n\nJexor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2689b23855830e3c5d33a612df90a46de1754d92","amp;dn":"Visual+Basic+2012+How+to+Program+%286th+Edition%29+Deitel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2689b23855830e3c5d33a612df90a46de1754d92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,137,178,56,85,131,14,60,93,51,166,18,223,144,164,109,225,117,77,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
