In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideasÃ¢â‚¬â€namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines. \n\n In a bold new concluding chapter entitled &quot;The End of the Worldly Philosophy?&quot; Heilbroner reminds us that the word &quot;end&quot; refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today's increasingly &quot;scientific&quot; economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. \n\n Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future.\n\n1999 epub\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79b561a61ffcdc8bcc73de399f47212c6f2b54a1","amp;dn":"Worldly+Philosophers%3A+Great+Economic+Thinkers%2C+7th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79b561a61ffcdc8bcc73de399f47212c6f2b54a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,181,97,166,31,252,220,139,204,115,222,57,159,71,33,44,111,43,84,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
