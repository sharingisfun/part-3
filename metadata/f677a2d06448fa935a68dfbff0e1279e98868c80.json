The album is a mixture of different genres, like the rough &quot;True Grit&quot;, to the wiry guitar rock song &quot;Born Too Slow&quot;. Legion of Boom contains vocals from actress Milla Jovovich and Kyuss lead singer John Garcia. The album also contains guitar riffs courtesy of Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland (who also co-produced three tracks) and vocal talents by beatboxer Rahzel. Its title is likely a reference to the supervillain team Legion of Doom.\n\nAn edited version of &quot;Born Too Slow&quot; was featured in the soundtrack for the video games Need for Speed: Underground and Donkey Konga 2. The song &quot;I Know It's You&quot; was used in the pilot episode of the TV show Numb3rs. Also, the song &quot;Bound Too Long&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the movie Cursed, and &quot;Starting Over&quot; was used in an episode of the TV show Alias and an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. A different version of &quot;Weapons of Mass Distortion&quot;, renamed &quot;Weapons of Mad Distortion&quot;, was used in the movie Blade: Trinity.\n\nThis album also contains the only known time either members of The Crystal Method have provided vocals for a song. The song that features this is &quot;I Know It's You&quot;, which has Ken Jordan of TCM singing through a vocoder.\n\nThe album was nominated for a Grammy in the &quot;Best Electronica/Dance Album&quot; category in 2005, the first year that any award was given out for that category.\n\nProvided here is the DVD Audio in MP3 320 bit rate with 2 bonus tracks\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n1.
