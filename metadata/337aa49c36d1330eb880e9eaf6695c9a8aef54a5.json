After the success of the Bee Gees in the late of 1970s, there was some time to write songs for other artists and Streisand, one of those artists, asked Barry Gibb to write an album for her. It became her best-selling album to date internationally with sales of over 12 million copies worldwide (according to an official press release) and was produced by Gibb and the Bee Gees' regular production team of Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson.
