It hailed the return of the band's most successful line-up of Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie and Stevie Nicks, who had not released an album together since 1987's Tango in the Night. It was the first Fleetwood Mac release to top the US album charts since 1982's Mirage. This was the last Fleetwood Mac album to feature Christine McVie, who departed the group a year after the album's release. Debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 199,000, The Dance became the fifth best-selling live album of all time in the United States, selling a million copies within eight weeks, spending more than seven months within the top 40, and eventually selling over 5 million copies there. The 44 date tour grossed $36 million.\n\n\nAlbum Info:\nArtist       : Fleetwood Mac\nAlbum        : The Dance\nGenre        : Classic Rock\nYear         : 1997\nLabel        : Reprise Records\nTracks       : 17\nPlaytime     : 01:19:08\nSize         : 182.01 MB\nCodec        : MPEG 1 Layer III / FhG / 320 kbps\n\n\nTrack List:\n01.

No tracks from the Mirage album were included on the CD, although &quot;Gypsy&quot; is included in the video and DVD versions.\n\nThe album cover, taken by David LaChapelle, has Mick Fleetwood recreating his pose from the cover of Rumours, the band's most successful album and Lindsey Buckingham holding the cane used on the cover of the Fleetwood Mac album.\n\nThis album spawned two singles; &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;Silver Springs&quot;.\n\n \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e6bdca594ec3c7de86d6e9890ec7485133baece","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+The+Dance+%281997%29++%28MP3-320kbps%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e6bdca594ec3c7de86d6e9890ec7485133baece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,107,220,165,148,236,60,125,232,109,110,152,144,236,116,133,19,59,174,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
