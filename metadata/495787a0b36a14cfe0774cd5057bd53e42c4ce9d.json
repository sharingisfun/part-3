THERE'S ANOTHER TORRENT FOR MP4s-MUCH SMALLER FILE (SEARCH FOR &quot;INSANITY&quot;)  NUTRITION GUIDE NOT INCLUDED. WILL TRY TO ADD AS A SEPARATE TORRENT LATER.  ISOs IN THE RAR FILE. USE WINRAR TO UNPACK. \n\nHey people, turn off your video game, put down the potato chips, get off your asses and work!\n\nI'm uploading this video so that there will be fewer fat and lazy people in the world. This is my gift to humanity.\n\nRemember, if you want results, you have to BRING IT! Oops, nevermind, that's the  P90X line.  I love P90X don't get me wrong, but if you want to take your cardio workouts to the next level, this is the program for you! Better yet, combine the two into a hybrid program as some people are doing (google it).\n\nNow I don't want any of y'all drinking that fruity drink they try to sell you at BeachBody.com.  Have you looked at the ingredients? Tons of FRUCTOSE.  People think that since it comes from fruit, it's healthy.  WRONG. Have you seen the studies linking fruit juice to chubby kids? It's true.  Cuz of the fructose. Too much fructose is BAAAD.  Just remember the rule: fructose is for fruitcakes.  Watch the ratios.  The higher the ratio of fructose to glucose, the worse it is for you.  Table sugar is 50-50.  It's ok in moderation.  Maple syrup is 25% (good stuff)  The sweetener in Beach Body recovery drink?  100% FRUCTOSE!!  I don't know what that Beach Body bum who designed the drink was thinking. You'll see the idiot at the end of the workouts selling his poison. Google recovery drink for some better options, including homemade ones.  Also, many people are FRUCTOSE INTOLERANT.  If drinking apple juice or honey makes you smell like you just diarread in your pants, you just may be fructose intolerant. That's a warning. \n\nSpeaking of maple syrup, only get the good stuff like organic from Canada.  Yes some good things comes out of Canada.  Don't be eating that crap from Aunt Jemima with the high fructose corn syrup.  Aunt Jemima might give some good lovin but you should never eat food that has a fat woman on the label.  That should be obvious.\n\nPush, Push Y'all, Push, Push! Make Shaun T. proud!\n\nAnd remember, when you look down and you can finally see your toes, when you run a block and you don't get winded, when the hot girl at work gives you a surprised look and smiles at you, it was flavaflav that hooked you up!\n\nOh and Wii Fitness is for suckers.  That's not a workout.  Remember, OLD SKOOL is better. Dig Deeper! Peace out!\n\n\n                          ..,==~~?~7I.                                          \n                        ,:I7+$ZOOO$OOI7:.                                       \n
