Her most successful single was the \r\nno. 1 hit &quot;I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)&quot; in 1976.\r\nBorn Tina Hoskins in Whitechapel, London, to actor Charles Hoskins and his wife \r\nHilda, she recovered from meningitis as a newborn. She has a brother, Warren, \r\nwho was her tour manager for a time during the height of her career.\r\nOn launching her music career, she did not use her real name, Hoskins, since \r\nthis might have caused confusion with Mary Hopkin, better known at the time. \r\nShe chose &quot;Charles&quot;, as it was her father's name.\r\nCharles was married to Bernard Webb and had a son Max, born in London in 1977. \r\nShe was divorced in 1979. She remarried in 1993 to her second husband, Tetoo. \r\nThey lived in Surrey, England. In 2014 she married David Fancourt from Caterham.\r\n\r\nAlbums:\r\n-------\r\nTina Sings (1973)\r\nI Love to Love (1976)\r\nDance Little Lady (1976)\r\nRendezvous (US release) (1977)\r\nHeart 'n' Soul (1977) UK no. 35\r\nGreatest Hits (1978)\r\nJust One Smile (1980)\r\nI Love to Love â€“ Greatest Hits (1987)\r\nWorld of Emotion (1993)\r\nI Love to Love â€“ The Best Of (1998)\r\nFoundation of Love (2004)\r\nListen 2 the Music (repackaged as Feels Like Sunday) (2008)\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                   Tina Charles - The Very Best Of\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArtist...............: \r\nAlbum................: The Very Best Of\r\nGenre................: Disco\r\nSource...............: Web\r\nYear.................: 1996\r\nLabel................: CMC Home Entertainment\r\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\r\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\r\nQuality..............: CBR 192, (avg. bitrate: 192kbps)\r\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 hz\r\nTags.................: ID3 v, ID3 v2.3\r\nInformation..........: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Charles_(singer)\r\n                       http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tina-charles-mn0000501852/biography\r\nPosted by............: gnv64 on 26/August/2016\r\nIncluded.............: NFO, M3U\r\nCovers...............: Front \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                       Tracklisting\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n   1.
