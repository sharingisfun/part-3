There is no such problem with Ali Farka TourÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s Savane. There may be other recordings of his that have yet to be released (including sessions with the world's finest kora player, Toumani DiabatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, recorded at the time of their memorable concert together at the Barbican last year), but this is the last solo album by the best-known and best-loved guitarist in Africa, and it's simply outstanding. He described it as &quot;my best album evera&quot; and he was absolutely right. Even compared to the much-praised earlier work by Mali's &quot;godfather of the desert blues&quot;, this is a set that's remarkable for its sheer variety and passion, along with the expected but still thrilling guitar work, and some less predictably fine vocals.\n\nTracklist:\n1.&quot;Erdi&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n2.&quot;Yer Bounda Fara&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n3.&quot;Beto&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n4.&quot;Savane&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:43\n5.&quot;Soya&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n6.&quot;Penda Yoro&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n7.&quot;Machengoidi&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n8.&quot;Ledi Coumbe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n9.&quot;Hanana&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n10.&quot;Soko Yhinka&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n11.&quot;Gambari Didi&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n12.&quot;Banga&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n13.&quot;N'Jarou&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n\nPersonnel:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Ali Farka TourÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals, percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Mama Sissoko ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ngoni\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Bassekou Kouyate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ngoni\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Dassy SarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ngoni\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Afel Bocoum ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (tracks 6, 7, 13)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Alou Coulibaly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ water calabash (7)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Ramata Diakite ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (3)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Massambou Wele Diallo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bolon (9)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Oumar Diallo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass (13)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Fanga Diawara ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ njarka violin (1, 7, 9)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Fain DueÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion (1, 3, 6, 9, 13)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Pee Wee Ellis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tenor sax (1, 3, 13)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Souleye KanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (2, 6, 7, 10), calabash (3, 5, 11, 12)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Mamadou Kelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ voice (11)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Ali Magassa ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (2, 6, 7, 10), guitar (5)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Etienne MbappÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass (6)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Yacouba Moumouni ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ flute (12)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Hammer Sankare ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (2, 5, 6, 7, 13)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Sonny ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass (10)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Little George Sueref ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica (1, 6, 8 )\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Marriame Tounkara ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (12)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Brehima Toure ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (10)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Oumar TourÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (2, 6, 7, 10), congas (3)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Yves Wernert ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass (1)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a409266d7f157b632f7464153e90a0146ba94e3e","amp;dn":"Ali+Farka+Toure++Savane+%28world+blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a409266d7f157b632f7464153e90a0146ba94e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,9,38,109,127,21,123,99,47,116,100,21,62,144,160,20,107,169,78,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
