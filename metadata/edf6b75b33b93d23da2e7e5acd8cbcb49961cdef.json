Twelfth Night was 'blissfully reborn' (The Daily Telegraph) for the 2012/2013 season at the Globe Theatre, under the direction of Tim Carroll. the hilarious tale of misdirection and deception is performed here by an all-male cast, as it would have been in Shakespeare's day, with Mark Rylance playing Olivia and Roger Lloyd Pack as the hapless Sir Andrew Aguecheek. The production also marks Stephen Fry's triumphant return to the stage as the pompous Malvolio, ridiculous in his yellow stockings.\n \nMy notes\n\n  This is another in the collection plays from The Globe Theatre.\nTwelfth Night has a different look from what has come before in these releases.  The production features am Original Practices presentation as it would be seen in the time of Shakespeare's England: with an all male cast.\n\n  You can see the actors costumed from the box art and from the Globe site.  \n\n  As always I ask that you support your local libraries by requesting this series be made part of permanent collections.  The torrents are presented so that the wide variety of countries which have downloaded them can enjoy theatre captured live from the Globe.  It is something few of us can do, mys  (myself included.)  The full dvd box includes subtitles in order to be able to follow the text.  \n\n  The stage has no architectural enhancements which is a normal feature of the Globe. You will note that the house and groundling area is packed.  The production was \nvery well-received both onstage and in review.\n\n\n  Notes written January 13th, 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf6b75b33b93d23da2e7e5acd8cbcb49961cdef","amp;dn":"Shakespeares+Globe+on+Screen+Twelfth+Night+from+Opus+Arte++%282012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf6b75b33b93d23da2e7e5acd8cbcb49961cdef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,246,183,91,51,185,61,35,218,46,126,90,205,140,188,180,153,97,205,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
