Chalmers et al. (Wiley, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book will provide a survey of the major areas in which information derived from vibrational spectroscopy investigations and studies have contributed to the benefit of forensic science, either in a complementary or a unique way. This is highlighted by examples taken from real case studies and analyses of forensic relevance, which provide a focus for current and future applications and developments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daf3c1b2a79e86c9b72593c0f60e6ea702c04cc1","amp;dn":"Infrared+and+Raman+Spectroscopy+in+Forensic+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daf3c1b2a79e86c9b72593c0f60e6ea702c04cc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,243,193,178,167,158,134,201,183,37,147,192,246,14,110,167,2,192,76,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
