Identifying critical points of knowledge and new methodological approaches in the field, Forensic Biology, Second Edition focuses on forensic serology and forensic DNA analysis. It provides students and professionals with a scientific grounding in biological evidence?both the techniques used to identify it and the methodology to analyze it.\n\nThis second edition:\n-  Introduces the language of forensic biology, enabling students to become comfortable with usage and terminology\n-  Provides clear explanations of the principles of forensic identification and analysis of biological evidence\n-  Explains forensic serology and DNA techniques used in the field and the laboratory\n-  Discusses the benefits and limitations that apply to various forensic biology techniques\n-  Includes schematic illustrations to clarify concepts\n-  Presents three new chapters created for this edition\n-  Adds more than two hundred new color figures\n\nCovering the full scope of forensic biology, the book uses an accessible, straightforward style designed to enhance studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ education and training so they are prepared, both in the laboratory and in the field.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface.... xv\nAcknowledgments....xvii\nAuthor.... xix\nIntroduction\nSECTION I Biological Evidence\nChapter 1 Crime Scene Investigation of Biological Evidence....3\nChapter 2 Crime Scene Bloodstain Pattern Analysis....35 \nChapter 3 Forensic Biology: A Subdiscipline of Forensic Science....53\nChapter 4 Sources of Biological Evidence.... 77\nSECTION II Basic Techniques in Forensic Biology\nChapter 5 Nucleic Acid Extraction....111\nChapter 6 DNA Quantitation....133\nChapter 7 Amplification by Polymerase Chain Reaction....143\nChapter 8 DNA Electrophoresis....159\nChapter 9 Detection Methods....175\nChapter 10 Serology Concepts.....189\nChapter 11 Serology Techniques: Past, Current, and Future.... 199\nSECTION III Identification of Biological Evidence\nChapter 12 Identification of Blood....231\nChapter 13 Species Identification.... 245\nChapter 14 Identification of Semen.... 257\nChapter 15 Identification of Saliva.... 277\nChapter 16 Identification of Vaginal Secretions and Menstrual Blood.... 289\nChapter 17 Identification of Urine, Sweat, Fecal Matter, and Vomitus.... 307\nSECTION IV Individualization of Biological Evidence\nChapter 18 Blood Group Typing and Protein Profiling....331\nChapter 19 Variable Number Tandem Repeat Profiling....353\nChapter 20 Autosomal Short Tandem Repeat Profiling....369\nChapter 21 Sex Chromosome Haplotyping and Gender Identification.... 407\nChapter 22 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Profiling.... 437\nChapter 23 Mitochondrial DNA Profiling.... 461\nSECTION V Forensic Issues\nChapter 24 Forensic DNA Databases: Tools for Crime Investigations.... 485\nChapter 25 Evaluation of the Strength of Forensic DNA Profiling Results.... 503\nChapter 26 Quality Assurance and Quality Control.... 523\nIndex....533\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s10.postimg.org/no07zc0i1/Forensic_Biology_2nd_Ed.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s10.postimg.org/no07zc0i1/Forensic_Biology_2nd_Ed.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce3a350ad607ccc91d2515279b937771c4ba03b","amp;dn":"Forensic+Biology+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce3a350ad607ccc91d2515279b937771c4ba03b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,227,163,80,173,96,124,204,145,210,81,82,121,185,55,119,28,75,160,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
