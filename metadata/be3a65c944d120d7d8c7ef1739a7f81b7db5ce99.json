He can't stop it - he doesn't want to. He couldn't want to, even if he'd been able to think about it. Scott can't take part in his transformation because he's already dead, and has been throughout most of it.\r\n\r\nBut he's been very, very busy.\r\n\r\nThe Agency owns most of the planet, and runs it with the aid of artificial intelligences who've betrayed them to a conquering race of aliens. Prehistoric interdimensional beings shift invisibly between worlds in competition with the Hive Queen for world dominance and influence over humanity's timeline. The Earth herself awakens and joins the struggle for freedom.\r\nThe puppets are cutting their strings, but it will take a human child to open the gates to the kingdom and slow the spread of darkness.\r\n\r\nA 'hard-boiled' sci-fi/horror tale of divorce and dissolution, as told through an alien reincarnating as a human being, several victims of mind-control, a bickering pair of sorcery-weilding intelligence agents,  and a cloud-computed pandemic viral nano-infection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3a65c944d120d7d8c7ef1739a7f81b7db5ce99","amp;dn":"Orgonomicon-B.D.Schleinkofer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3a65c944d120d7d8c7ef1739a7f81b7db5ce99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,58,101,201,68,209,32,215,216,199,239,23,57,167,248,27,125,181,206,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
