The game is set during the original Star Wars trilogy and recreates battles that take place during those films. The game follows the Rogue Squadron, which, under the command of Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles, uses starfighters to engage and defeat the Galactic Empire.\n\nRebel Strike was developed as a sequel to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron and Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader. Rebel Strike added the ability for players to leave their starfighters to participate in ground battles as well as enter and pilot other vehicles during certain missions. The game also has a two-player multiplayer mode allowing co-operative play for all but two missions from Rogue Leader.\n\n=================================================================================\n\nJust burn it or use Nintendont to play in your Wii/VWii works with HDD/SD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bf8735ccacf644f8941f13847804cdacb9394a8","amp;dn":"%5BNGC%5D+Star+Wars+Rogue+Squadron+III+-+Rebel+Strike+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bf8735ccacf644f8941f13847804cdacb9394a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,248,115,92,202,207,100,79,137,65,241,56,71,128,76,218,203,147,148,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
