A harried working mother whoâ€™s so busy taking care of her husband and twins, she doesnâ€™t even realize sheâ€™s had a heart attack.\r\nAfterward, surprised to discover that her recuperation seems to be an imposition on those who rely on her, Maribeth does the unthinkable: She packs a bag and leaves. But, as is so often the case, once we get to where weâ€™re going, we see our lives from a different perspective. Far from the demands of family and career and with the help of liberating new friendships, Maribeth is finally able to own up to secrets she has been keeping from those she loves and from herself.\r\nWith big-hearted characters who stumble and trip, grow and forgive, Leave Me is about facing our fears. Gayle Forman, a dazzling observer of human nature, has written an irresistible novel that confronts the ambivalence of modern motherhood head-on.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:292c3139b676283084b1fe158336dacd9355c04e","amp;dn":"Leave+Me+-+Gayle+Forman+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"292c3139b676283084b1fe158336dacd9355c04e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,44,49,57,182,118,40,48,132,177,254,21,131,54,218,205,147,85,192,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
