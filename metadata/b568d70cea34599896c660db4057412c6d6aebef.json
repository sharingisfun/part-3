There is something very special in his music. However I do not have enough material to make a serious shortlist and a lot of material do not sound that good. However, Near Ed Sheeran, Jason Mraz, Damien Rice and Citizen Cope, Ben should be present as well. I will upgrade it later when more songs become available.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\nDutch Treat - ^B055 Promise (Ben Howard)\n\n01 Everything\n02 Bones\n03 Black Flies\n04 Old Pine\n05 Oats In The Water\n06 Only Love\n07 The Fear\n08 Further Away\n09 Keep Your Head Up\n10 Three Tree Town\n11 Follaton Wood\n12 The Wolves\n13 Esmerelda\n14 Promise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b568d70cea34599896c660db4057412c6d6aebef","amp;dn":"Ben+Howard+%28Indie+Folk%29+-+Promise+%28Dutch+Treat+B055%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b568d70cea34599896c660db4057412c6d6aebef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,104,215,12,234,52,89,152,150,198,96,219,64,87,65,44,109,106,235,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
