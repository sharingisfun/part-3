Students are introduced to the sound, six-step problem solving methodology in chapter one, and are consistently made to apply and practice these steps in practice problems and homework problems throughout the text.\nA balance of theory, worked examples and extended examples, practice problems, and real-world applications, combined with over 468 new or changed homework problems for the fifth edition and robust media offerings, renders the fifth edition the most comprehensive and student-friendly approach to linear circuit analysis.\nThis edition retains the Design a Problem feature which helps students develop their design skills by having the student develop the question as well as the solution. There are over 100 Design a Problem exercises integrated into the problem sets in the book.\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Charles K. Alexander (Athens, OH) is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Ohio and served as the President and CEO of the IEEE from 1996-1999.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface xi\nPART 1 DC Circuits 2\nChapter 1 Basic Concepts 3\nChapter 2 Basic Laws 29\nChapter 3 Methods of Analysis 81\nChapter 4 Circuit Theorems 127\nChapter 5 Operational Amplifiers 175\nChapter 6 Capacitors and Inductors 215\nChapter 7 First-Order Circuits 253\nChapter 8 Second-Order Circuits 313\nPART 2 AC Circuits 368\nChapter 9 Sinusoids and Phasors 369\nChapter 10 Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis 413\nChapter 11 AC Power Analysis 457\nChapter 12 Three-Phase Circuits 503\nChapter 13 Magnetically Coupled Circuits 555\nChapter 14 Frequency Response 613\nPART 3 Advanced Circuit Analysis 674\nChapter 15 Introduction to the Laplace Transform 675\nChapter 16 Applications of the Laplace Transform 715\nChapter 17 The Fourier Series 759\nChapter 18 Fourier Transform 813\nChapter 19 Two-Port Networks 853\nAppendix A Simultaneous Equations and Matrix Inversion A\nAppendix B Complex Numbers A-9\nAppendix C Mathematical Formulas A-16\nAppendix D Answers to Odd-Numbered\nProblems A-21\nSelected Bibliography B-1\nIndex I-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c65392c862c0ca4586af7be96ce6960edeb99ab5","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Electric+Circuits+%285th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c65392c862c0ca4586af7be96ce6960edeb99ab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,83,146,200,98,192,202,69,134,175,123,233,108,230,150,14,222,185,154,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
