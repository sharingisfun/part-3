Hall), a forensic bloodstain pattern analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department, who moonlights as a serial killer.\n\nThe show debuted on October 1, 2006 on Showtime and the fifth season began airing on September 26, 2010. As of December 2, 2010 the show has been renewed for a sixth season. Set in Miami, the show's first season was largely based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay, the first of his series of Dexter novels. Subsequent seasons have evolved independently of Lindsay's works. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the pilot episode.\n\nDexter structures his killing around &quot;The Code of Harry&quot;, a body of ethics and procedures devised by his adoptive father Harry (who was a Miami cop) to make sure Dexter never gets caught and ensure that Dexter kills only other killers. Harry also trained Dexter in how to interact convincingly with other people despite being a psychopath, since the murder of his biological mother, Laura Moser, did in fact turn Dexter into a serial killer. As an adult, Dexter has largely escaped suspicion (with some exceptions) by being genial and generous and maintaining generally superficial relationships. However, his attachment to his sister Deb, his significant other Rita, his stepchildren and (later) his biological son have all complicated his double life and made him question his need to kill.\n\nIn February 2008, edited reruns began to air on CBS. The series has enjoyed wide critical acclaim and popularity. Season 4 aired its season finale on December 13, 2009 to a record-breaking audience of 2.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode ever on Showtime. Michael C. Hall has received several awards and nominations for his portrayal of Dexter, including a Golden Globe. The series was picked up by Showtime for a sixth season, which was billed as not being the final season, leaving possibilities open for a seventh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503f2b7739309ebab6c486a88bf848a75bb4ba64","amp;dn":"Dexter+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4+%26+5+HDTV+%2B+Extras+%28Early+Cuts+%2B+Audiobo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503f2b7739309ebab6c486a88bf848a75bb4ba64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,63,43,119,57,48,158,186,182,196,134,168,139,248,72,167,91,180,186,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
