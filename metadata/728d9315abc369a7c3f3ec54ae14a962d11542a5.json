Dependent on his new employers for his continued existence - as Alex has no stomach for predatory bloodsucking - he has little choice but to accept his new role as an operative in training.\r\n\r\nDispatched to Leeds, Alex's first assignment is to help assess the costs of renovating a 1950s Cold War bunker into The Laundry's new headquarters. Unfortunately Leeds is Alex's hometown, and the thought of breaking the news to his parents that he's left banking for civil service, while hiding his undead condition, is causing more anxiety than learning how to live as a vampire secret agent preparing to confront multiple apocalypses.\r\n\r\nAlex's only saving grace is Cassie Brewer, a drama student appearing in the local Goth Festival who is inexplicably attracted to him despite his awkward personality and massive amounts of sunblock.\r\n\r\nBut Cassie has secrets of her own - secrets that make Alex's nightlife behaviors seem positively normal.... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLength: 14 hrs and 53 mins \r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nRelease Date:06-28-16\r\nPublisher: Recorded Books","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:728d9315abc369a7c3f3ec54ae14a962d11542a5","amp;dn":"Charles+Stross+-+The+Nightmare+Stacks+%28Laundry+Files+%237%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"728d9315abc369a7c3f3ec54ae14a962d11542a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,141,147,21,171,195,105,167,195,243,236,84,174,20,169,98,209,21,66,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
