During WWII, Pasqualino Frafuso (Giancarlo Giannini) ends up lost in a dense forest along with fellow army deserter Francesco (Piero De Orio). After they witness a mass execution by German soldiers, Francesco admits his moral opposition to the Nazis and Pasqualino reveals his criminal past in a series of flashbacks. Back in Naples, he was known as &quot;Pasqualino Seven Beauties,&quot; a petty thief who lived off the profits of his seven sisters while claiming to protect their honor at any cost. When Totonno (Mario Conti) pimps out his sister Concettina (Elena Fiore), Pasqualino kills him, chops up his body, and mails each piece across the country. He is then arrested and sent to a mental institution, where he commits sexual assault against another patient. Kicked out of the asylum, he is sent to fight in the army. The Germans capture him and he gets sent to a concentration camp. He then plots to make his escape by demoralizing himself in an attempt to seduce a German officer (Shirley Stoler). Seven Beauties was nominated for four Academy Awards in 1977, including Best Foreign Film. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Pasqualino Settebellezze.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.59 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 56mn\n      Bit rate : 1951 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 11.9 MiB\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 56mn\n      Bit rate : 1498 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.253\n      StreamSize : 1.22 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, Subwoofer\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 371 MiB\n      Coherency/PlayTime : 3898\n\nIMDB: tt0075040\n\nItalian audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at Secret-Cinema by joe mallon.
