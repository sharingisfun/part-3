Although I do enjoy live recordings, I was looking for a collection of studio recordings that day. Nonetheless, I was not disappointed with this purchase. As a child of the seventies with a mother who adored this man and purchased every record he ever made, I am no stranger this music. I even remember hearing about his sensual ladies only concerts.\nTeddy Pendergrass is definitely a legend and this CD captured him at the pinnacle of his career playing before his hometown crowd. You have all the great hits &quot;Life is a Song Worth Singing,&quot; &quot;When Somebody Loves You Back,&quot; &quot;Close the Door,&quot; and of course his signature song &quot;Turn off the Lights.&quot;\nHis style is inimitable and he had a way with a song that just sent chills up your spine. Between his wonderful voice and his commanding physical presence, Teddy P always had a captive audience. This CD is a wonderful tribute to a talented artist. This man is an original, and I love his work.[/quote]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Teddy Pendergrass - Live!
