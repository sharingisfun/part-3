Geithner was sworn in by President Barack Obama as the seventy-fifth Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. Now, in a strikingly candid, riveting, and historically illuminating memoir, Geithner takes readers behind the scenes during the darkest moments of the crisis. Swift, decisive, and creative action was required to avert a second Great Depression, but policy makers faced a fog of uncertainty, with no good options and the risk of catastrophic outcomes.\n\nStress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises takes us inside the room, explaining in accessible and forthright terms the hard choices and politically unpalatable decisions that Geithner and others in the Obama administration made during the crisis and recovery. He discusses the most controversial moments of his tenures at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and at the Treasury, including the harrowing weekend Lehman Brothers went bankrupt; the searing crucible of the AIG bonuses controversy; the development of his widely criticized but ultimately successful plan in early 2009 to end the crisis; the bracing fight for the most sweeping financial reforms in seventy years; and the lingering aftershocks of the crisis, including high unemployment, the fiscal battles, and EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repeated flirtations with the economic abyss.\n\nGeithner also shares his personal and professional recollections of key players such as President Obama, Ben Bernanke, Hank Paulson, and Larry Summers, among others, and examines the tensions between politics and policy that have come to dominate discussions of the U.S. economy. An insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account of how the Obama administration saved the economy but lost the American people, Stress Test reveals a side of Timothy Geithner that only few have seen.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s written a really good book Ã¢â‚¬â€ we might as well get that out of the way, as so much else about Timothy F. Geithner remains unsettledÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly a moment in GeithnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story when the reader feels he is being anything but straightforward Ã¢â‚¬â€ a near-superhuman feat for someone who spent so much time in public life defending himself from careless and dishonest personal attacks. The decisions he made are easier to criticize than they are to improve upon. I doubt many readers will put his book down and think the man did anything but his best. On his feet he might have stammered and wavered. That in itself was always a sign he was unusually brave.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œMichael Lewis, New York Times Book Review\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An intimate take on the financial crisisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ grippingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ conveys in visceral terms just how precarious things were during the crisis, just how frightened many first responders were, and just what an achievement it was to avert a major depressionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ [Geithner] demonstrates that he can discuss economics in an accessible fashion, making the situation the country faced in 2008 and 2009 tactile, comprehensibleÃ¢â‚¬â€and harrowingÃ¢â‚¬â€to the lay reader. Along the way, he also gives us a telling portrait of himself.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œNew York Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A how-to manual for anyone faced with a financial crisisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Mr Geithner was known for his brutal candor, and as an author, he does not disappoint.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The Economist\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A fascinating memoir about life in the maelstrom of the financial crisisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Earlier books have described much of what happened that September, but Geithner was present for all the frantic meetings, the thousands of phone calls Ã¢â‚¬â€ and in the case of Lehman, the failure to find a buyer that could keep it alive. New problems cropped up almost weekly, if not daily. He explains each in easy-to-understand language and what the issues were that shaped the responsesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ There could be another crisis someday, of course, but what Geithner and his colleagues did has made one far less likely.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œUSA Today\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sharply worded and candid memoir.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Financial Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Geithner does an admirable job of explaining the origins and complexities of the crisis for the average person. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enough detail and retrospective lessons-learned to make it valuable for students of financial historyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.fast-paced and colorfulÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.Stress Test goes beyond other crisis books.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œLos Angeles Times\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An unsparing insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account of the financial crisis from the former Secretary of the Treasury, unpacking the hard decisions and terrible trade-offs that devastated the economy but staved off a deep, lasting depression.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€TIME.com\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The central irony of Stress Test, the new memoir by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, is that a guy who was accused of being a lousy communicator while in office has penned a book that is such a good readÃ¢â‚¬Â¦IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve now read four or five of these first drafts of the history of the Great Recession, and I believe Stress Test represents the biggest contribution of the bunch.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Bill Gates\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sensational . . . TimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book will forever be the definitive work on what causes financial panics and what must be done to stem them when they occur.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Warren Buffett\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Very few important subjects in American history have been the subject of as much disinformation and deliberate distortion as the events surrounding the financial crisis that broke in 2008. Tim GeithnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s candid, clear-headed, and refreshingly self-effacing account of his role in formulating the federal governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response is a very welcome antidote. GeithnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is a triple threat: it is first-rate economic history, insightful political science, and, most important, a cogent exposition of the importance of adhering to the policies adopted in the aftermath of the crisis if we are to succeed in diminishing the likelihood of any recurrence.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Barney Frank\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Stress Test is an absolutely compelling account of the financial crisis, written in a clear, graceful style with striking honesty at every step along the way. Timothy Geithner brings a complex story to life with telling anecdotes and personal reflections.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Doris Kearns Goodwin\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is a lucid, fascinating, and extremely important book. Every American should read it. Geithner does something unusual: he engages in substance. With both insight and humility, plus a good dose of wry humor, he explains what really happened during the financial crisis. No matter your political persuasion, you will find this book educational, enlightening, and interesting.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Walter Isaacson\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The country owes Tim Geithner great appreciation for his role in overcoming the financial crisis of 2008. He has now indebted it further with writing a thoughtful, very readable and informative account of the conduct of policy at the edge of disaster.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Henry A. Kissinger\n\n\nRead by Timothy F.
