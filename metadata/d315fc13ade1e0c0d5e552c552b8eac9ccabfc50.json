An authoritative new edition in two volumes, Handbook of herbs and spices provides a comprehensive guide to the properties, production and application of a wide variety of commercially-significant herbs and spices.\r\n\r\nVolume 1 begins with an introduction to herbs and spices, discussing their definition, trade and applications. Both the quality specifications for herbs and spices and the quality indices for spice essential oils are reviewed in detail, before the book goes on to look in depth at individual herbs and spices, ranging from basil to vanilla. Each chapter provides detailed coverage of a single herb or spice and begins by considering origins, chemical composition and classification. The cultivation, production and processing of the specific herb or spice is then discussed in detail, followed by analysis of the main uses, functional properties and toxicity.\r\n\r\nWith its distinguished editor and international team of expert contributors, the two volumes of the new edition of Handbook of herbs and spices are an essential reference for manufacturers using herbs and spices in their products. They also provide valuable information for nutritionists and academic researchers.\r\n\r\nProvides a comprehensive guide to the properties, production and application of a wide variety of commercially-significant herbs and spices\r\nBegins with a discussion of the definition, trade and applications of herbs and spices\r\nReviews the quality specifications for herbs and spices and examines the quality indices for spice essential oils","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d315fc13ade1e0c0d5e552c552b8eac9ccabfc50","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Herbs+and+Spices+-+Volume+1%2C+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d315fc13ade1e0c0d5e552c552b8eac9ccabfc50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,21,252,19,173,225,224,192,213,229,82,197,82,184,234,201,204,171,252,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
