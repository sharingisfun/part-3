Now architect Zac Monro, engineer Monty Ravenscroft and gardener Rosie Bines use imagination, technology and ingenuity to tear down the walls of seven houses across Britain, creating homes and outside spaces that unlock the potential of living inside and out like never before.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Manchester \r\nTo begin they create a glass atrium for an 18th-century barn by covering a courtyard with a bespoke glass roof, and turn the garden of a Victorian semi in Manchester into the heart of a family home.\r\n\r\n2)  Stockport and Devon \r\nArchitect Zac Monro comes up with a radical redesign for a 1950s bungalow in Stockport, including the addition of a first floor clad in burnt timber and huge ground-floor windows opening onto a garden-cum-sitting room. He also updates an outdated family home in Devon with the clever use of a mirror-image extension, and visits an award-winning property on the edge of the Norfolk Broads.\r\n\r\n3)  London and Newcastle \r\nZac comes up with a radical solution for a 1970s ex-council house in south London - knocking it down and starting again with an open-plan design. In Jesmond, Newcastle, the team is hired to update a 1940s house, adding a garden office and new kitchen. Engineer Monty Ravenscroft transforms the garden shed with mirrors and LED lighting, while Rosie Bines plants a white garden that can be enjoyed both day and night.\r\n\r\n4)  Newcastle \r\nZac Monro reinvents a 1930s bungalow on a sought-after estate in Newcastle, a plan that involves removing an entire brick wall and replacing it with glass and decking immediately outside. Monty Ravenscroft builds a fire-pit table to help the owners keep warm while they cook and gardener Rosie Bines creates a scented oasis around the log-fired hot tub.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/69/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b1/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/49/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9c/Inside-Out-Homes-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-21 (~2728 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 916 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/d8pbmc/inside-out-homes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec58d3d0fbb41f1b5abb031577ec19b9b125ef94","amp;dn":"Ch4+Inside+Out+Homes+4of4+Newcastle+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec58d3d0fbb41f1b5abb031577ec19b9b125ef94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,88,211,208,251,180,31,27,90,187,3,21,119,236,25,185,177,37,239,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
