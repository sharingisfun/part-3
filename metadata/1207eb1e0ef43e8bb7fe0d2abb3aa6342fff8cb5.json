(see list below)\n\nWe started this journey on April 18th 2014 and we just finished editing and producing it. Unlike most documentaries that spend 8 months in the editing room, making the perfect movie, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all about speed over perfection. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had others laugh thinking that we couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t film, edit, and broadcast live in less than 6 weeks. Well guess whatÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a team thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about beating the odds, just like the people weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re making this for, and we know that you need the information NOW regardless if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“prettyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or fancy. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re committed to delivering you the most cutting edge and current information on preventing and treating cancer.\n\nThis torrent includes all 7 episodes of the 2014 series.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nJediMaster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1207eb1e0ef43e8bb7fe0d2abb3aa6342fff8cb5","amp;dn":"The+Truth+About+Cancer+%282014%29+All+7+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1207eb1e0ef43e8bb7fe0d2abb3aa6342fff8cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,7,235,30,14,244,62,139,183,254,13,42,187,58,166,52,47,255,140,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
