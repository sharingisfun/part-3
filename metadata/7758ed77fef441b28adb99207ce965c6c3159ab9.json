Collins' rich, melancholy vocals were most likely an influence on Sandy Denny, Maddy Prior, and Jacqui McShee. Graham helped redefine the nature of folk accompaniment with his imaginative, rhythmic backing, which drew from jazz, blues, and a bit of Middle Eastern music as well as mainline British Isles folk. Performed with tasteful restraint and selected with imaginative eclecticism, the album also includes an instrumental showcase for Graham in &quot;Rif Mountain,&quot; which provides evidence of his clear influence on guitarists such as Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, and the acoustic style of Jimmy Page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7758ed77fef441b28adb99207ce965c6c3159ab9","amp;dn":"Davy+Graham+%26amp%3B+Shirley+Collins+-+Folk+Roots%2C+New+Routes+%5B1964","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7758ed77fef441b28adb99207ce965c6c3159ab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,88,237,119,254,244,65,178,138,219,153,32,124,233,101,198,195,21,154,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
