Marc Maron seems to have a distinctly American version of the Jerusalem Syndrome, which has led him on a lifelong quest for religious significance and revelation in the most unlikely of places.\n\nMaron riffs on Beat phenomena with its sacred texts, established rituals, and prescribed pilgrimages. He spends some time exploring the dark side of things, as his obsessions with cocaine (known to Maron as Ã¢â‚¬Å“magic powderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), conspiracy theories, and famous self-destructive comedians convince him that the gates of hell open beneath Los Angeles. As his quest matures, he reveals the religious aspects of Corporate America, pontificating on the timeless beauty of the Coca-Cola logo and even taking a trip to the Philip Morris cigarette factory, where the workers puff their own products with a zealot-like fervor. The culmination of MaronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jerusalem Syndrome comes during his own tour of the Holy Land, where, with Sony camcorder glued to his eye socket, he comes face-to-face with his own ambiguous relationship to Judaism and reaches the brink of spiritual revelation - or is it nervous breakdown?\n\nMarc Maron has considerably adapted and expanded his praised one-man show to craft a genuine literary memoir. Whether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a genuine prophet or a neurotic mess, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make you laugh as you question the meaning of life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae5d8e90ddb28258fd93dceaa9d89e02ad05b0a1","amp;dn":"The+Jerusalem+Syndrome+-+Marc+Maron+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae5d8e90ddb28258fd93dceaa9d89e02ad05b0a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,93,142,144,221,178,130,88,253,147,220,234,169,216,158,2,173,5,176,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
