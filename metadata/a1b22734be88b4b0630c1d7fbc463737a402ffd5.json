It tells the story of the new head of a mental asylum who turns out not to be what he claims. The film stars Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck, Michael Chekhov and Leo G. Carroll. It is an adaptation by Angus MacPhail and Ben Hecht of the novel The House of Dr. Edwardes (1927) by Hilary Saint George Saunders and John Palmer (writing as Francis Beeding).\n\nDr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a psychiatrist with a firm understanding of human natureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or so she thinks. When the mysterious Dr. Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck) becomes the new chief of staff at her institution, the bookish and detached Constance plummets into a whirlwind of tangled identities and feverish psychoanalysis, where the greatest risk is to fall in love. A transcendent love story replete with taut excitement and startling imagery, Spellbound is classic Hitchcock, featuring stunning performances, an Academy Award winning score by Miklos Rozsa, and a captivating dream sequence by Surrealist icon Salvador Dali.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Spellbound (1945)[DVDRip][big_dad_e]\\Spellbound (1945)[DVDRip][big_dad_e].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.09 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 318 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DIVX\nCodec ID/Info                    : Project Mayo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 4\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nBit rate                         : 1 176 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.114\nStream size                      : 995 MiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : avc2.0.11.1110\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 108 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.96.1\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5072\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/8/2010 11:56:45 PM\nmbam-log-2010-11-08 (23-56-45).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 7\nTime elapsed: 12 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
