However, things start cooling down after a while.[8] After an interview with Behind the Hero, Ratchet and Clank are suddenly teleported to the Bogon Galaxy by Abercrombie Fizzwidget, the founder and CEO of Megacorp, a corporation that manufactures every product in the Bogon Galaxy. Fizzwidget asks the duo for their assistance in recovering a stolen biological experiment.[9] Ratchet is equipped with some weapons and is sent to a flying laboratory on planet Aranos to search for the Experiment, where he finds it in a cage. The thief reveals himself, and Ratchet attempts to cover his identity up by lying.[10] The thief takes the Experiment, and leaves the ship. Ratchet returns to his ship and contacts Fizzwidget, informing him of the thief's escape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a5ab2299a7fb74c6df797105745064dd6124833","amp;dn":"ratchet+and+clank+going+commando+%28PS2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a5ab2299a7fb74c6df797105745064dd6124833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,90,178,41,154,127,183,76,109,247,151,16,87,69,6,77,214,18,72,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
