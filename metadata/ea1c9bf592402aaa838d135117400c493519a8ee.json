The film&amp;#039;s intricate \n\nstory is triggered by petty thief Johnny O&amp;#039;Hara (Dermot Mulroney), who aims for a big score by trying to rob notorious \n\ncrime boss Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte), only to end up Seen&amp;#039;s captive. In fear for her husband&amp;#039;s life, Johnny&amp;#039;s wife \n\nBlondie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) decides to take action. Following an eccentric personal logic, she takes as a hostage the wife \n\nof a prominent local politician, in hopes of getting the woman&amp;#039;s husband to help; unfortunately, he is on the road with an \n\nupcoming presidential campaign, putting a major hitch in Blondie&amp;#039;s plans. The film moves freely among its idiosyncratic \n\ncharacters in an overt attempt to mimic the improvisational structure of 1930s jazz. Indeed, many of the film&amp;#039;s most \n\nimportant sequences take place in Seldom Seen&amp;#039;s club, with contemporary jazz greats imitating the period&amp;#039;s master \n\nmusicians and Harry Belafonte shining as the magnetic, menacing Seen. The central narrative never achieves the seemingly \n\neffortless integration of Altman&amp;#039;s greatest works, but those who share Altman&amp;#039;s obvious passion for the period and its \n\nmusic will find much to admire.\n   General\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      Bit rate : 1553 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 7.70 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : English / English\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      Bit rate : 1425 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.229\n    Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      Bit rate : 119 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0116745\n\nEnglish audio, no subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea1c9bf592402aaa838d135117400c493519a8ee","amp;dn":"Robert+Altman+%281996%29+Kansas+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea1c9bf592402aaa838d135117400c493519a8ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,28,155,245,146,64,42,170,131,141,19,81,23,64,12,73,53,25,168,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
