Six months after the first show, one year after beginning the process of teaching himself how to sing, the first tracks were laid for Avalanche City's debut album Our New Life Above The Ground.\n\n Armed with a sack full of vegetarian single serve curries Dave Baxter headed into the countryside and moved into a little community hall called the Kourawhero Hall, just north of Auckland. There he spent the week alone recording and playing everything himself with only the cows and the milk trucks as company. \n\n/Avalanche City - 2011 - Our New Life Above the Ground/\n\t\n01 Love Love Love .flac\t21.83 MB\n02 Everybody Knows .flac\t6.66 MB\n03 Drive On .flac\t23.64 MB\n04 The Streets .flac\t21.61 MB\n05 The Citizens .flac\t21.09 MB\n06 You and I .flac\t20.48 MB\n07 Love Don't Leave .flac\t21.33 MB\n08 Go .flac\t16.15 MB\n09 Ends In the Ocean .flac\t25.71 MB\n10 Oh Life .flac\t6.42 MB\n11 How Long .flac\t13.80 MB\n12 The Silence .flac\t25.94 MB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/01 Snow .flac\t24.21 MB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/02 Beautiful .flac\t8.67 MB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/03 Drive On (Acoustic) .flac\t17.80 MB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/04 Goodnight .flac\t20.49 MB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/05 Slowly Over Me .flac\t27.62 MB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/06 We Fall Down .flac\t11.86 MB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/07 The Silence (Acoustic) .flac\t15.09 MB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/Avalanche City Snow.log\t7.73 KB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/Avalanche City Snow.m3u\t495.00 B\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/Snow.cue\t1.26 KB\nAvalanche City 2011 Snow/folder.jpg\t115.12 KB\nAvalanche City Our New Life Above the Ground.log\t11.73 KB\nAvalanche City Our New Life Above the Ground.m3u\t795.00 B\nOur New Life Above the Ground.cue\t2.34 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc4ac6ee27e7590f40a4be570e2680f86694b9df","amp;dn":"Avalanche+City+-+Our+New+Life+Above+The+Ground+%5BLimited+Edition%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc4ac6ee27e7590f40a4be570e2680f86694b9df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,74,198,238,39,231,89,15,64,164,190,87,14,38,128,248,102,148,185,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
