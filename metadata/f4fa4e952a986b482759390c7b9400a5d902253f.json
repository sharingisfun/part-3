Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs (guitar), Paul &quot;Guigsy&quot; McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals). They have had eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums, and won fifteen NME Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six BRIT Awards, including one in 2007 for outstanding contribution to music and one for the best album of the last 30 years as voted by the BBC Radio 2 listeners; they have been nominated for three Grammy Awards. As of 2009, the band have sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide. Also the band was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records in 2010 for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLongest Top 10 UK Chart Run By A GroupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ after an unprecedented run of 22 top 10 hits in the UK.The band also holds the Guinness World Record for being the &quot;Best band Britain has produced in the Last Decade&quot; in the UK between the years 1995 and 2005, spending 765 weeks in the Top 75 singles and albums charts.\n\nIts members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and afterwards released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994. The following year, the band recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with their new drummer Alan White in the midst of rivalry with Britpop peers Blur in the charts. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now, and although it became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, the album's popularity tapered off quickly. The band lost members Paul McGuigan and Paul Arthurs as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants in 2000 and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the tour in support of Giants. The band found renewed success and popularity starting with 2005's Don't Believe the Truth.\n\nIn August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band after a backstage altercation with Liam before a festival appearance. The band, comprising the remaining members of Oasis and led by Liam Gallagher, decided to continue working together under the name Beady Eye.\n\nPLEASE HELP SEEDiNG - FOR THE FREEDOM TO SHARE AMONG ALL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4fa4e952a986b482759390c7b9400a5d902253f","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+The+Ultimate+Discography+%5BMp3+320+Kbps%5D+%5BTNTVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4fa4e952a986b482759390c7b9400a5d902253f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,250,78,149,42,152,107,72,39,89,57,12,123,148,0,165,217,2,37,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
