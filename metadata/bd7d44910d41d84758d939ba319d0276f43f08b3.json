It makes abstract ideas explicit and clearly connects it with real practices of geographical research and knowledge.\r\n\r\nWritten with flair and passion, A Student's Introduction to Geographical Thought:\r\n\r\nExplains the key ideas: scientific realism, anti-realism and idealism / positivism / critical rationalism / Marxism and critical realism/ social constructionism and feminism / phenomenology and post-phenomenology / postmodernism and post-structuralism / complexity / moral philosophy.\r\nUses examples that address both physical geography and human geography.\r\nUse a familiar and real-world example - â€˜the beachâ€™ - as an entry point to basic questions of philosophy, returning to this to illustrate and to explain the links between philosophy, theory, and methodology.\r\nAll chapters end with summaries and sources of further reading, a glossary explaining key terms, exercises with commentaries, and web resources of key articles from the journals Progress in Human Geography and Progress in Physical Geography. A Student's Introduction to Geographical Thought is a completely accessible student A-Z of theory and practice for both human and physical geography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd7d44910d41d84758d939ba319d0276f43f08b3","amp;dn":"A+Student%26rsquo%3Bs+Introduction+to+Geographical+Thought","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd7d44910d41d84758d939ba319d0276f43f08b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,125,68,145,13,65,216,71,88,217,57,186,49,157,2,118,244,63,8,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
