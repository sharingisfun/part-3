SEE BELOW FOR GAPLESS PLAYBACK TIPS !!!!\n\n\n(Personal Notes: This is a result of 8+ hours of work but it's nothing compared to the albums i've downloaded and the pleasure of listening to them so SHARE IT !!!)\n\n\n**** Berimbau Loops ****\n\nFor all you capoeristas and small isolated grupos with no berimbau or no berimbau players except the coach (such as my own), just plug in the loop you like and press repeat and you'll have the toque (rhythm) you want indefinitely\n\nSince the berimbau is the hardest instrument to play and to obtain even, with these loops you can plug them in and play your pandieros, atabaques and sing to your heart's content :D\n\nTracklist:\n*Angola (slow, jogo de dentro)\n*Benguela\n*Sao Bento Grande\n*Iuna\n\nThere's also raw Toque tracks in case there's a toque you want to loop\n\nLET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT OTHER TOQUES !!!\n\nDedicated to: Lau Chi Samer Hassan, Vincent (Flama), All my capoerista friends and anyone who uses it :)\n\n\n----GAPLESS PLAYBACK: iPod:----\n \nSince selecting a track and pressing repeat will make a gap, do this: \n   \n   -Make a playlist\n   -Put the loop in it and then add as much copies as you want (highlight the track, ctrl+c, ctrl+v, press &quot;Add&quot;)\n\n\n\n----GAPLESS PLAYBACK: Nokia Phones (s60 systems):----\n   \n   This will be more space consuming since you'll have to make actual multiple copies of the file on the memory card\n\n     -Make as much copies as you want of the file (highlight, ctrl+c, ctrl+v)\n     -Make a folder and put the toque loop file WITH the copies in it\n     -Play the files using FolderPlay: http://sourceforge.net/projects/folderplay/\n      It's very simple and has Gapless playback\n\n\n\nHope you enjoy it, now vamos jogar ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec00b297ca8dde4761bfb87a662320e45ea6568d","amp;dn":"Capoeira+Music+-+Berimbau+Loops","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec00b297ca8dde4761bfb87a662320e45ea6568d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,0,178,151,202,141,222,71,97,191,184,122,102,35,32,228,94,166,86,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
