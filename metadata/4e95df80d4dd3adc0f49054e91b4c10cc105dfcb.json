While the book has\nevolved over the years to meet the changing learning styles of students, the\nfundamental goals of the text remain unchanged. These goals are:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ To build an understanding of concepts and ideas explicitly in terms of\nprevious learning. Students are constantly challenged by the need to\nlayer new concepts on top of previous concepts they may still be\nstruggling to master. This text provides an important focus on helping\nstudents understand how new concepts are related to and rely upon\nconcepts previously presented.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ To emphasize the relationship between conceptual understanding\nand problem-solving approaches. Developing problem-solving skills\ncontinues to be the central challenge in a first-year circuits course. In\nthis text we include numerous Examples that present problemsolving\ntechniques followed by Assessment Problems that enable\nstudents to test their mastery of the material and techniques introduced.\nThe problem-solving process we illustrate is based on concepts\nrather than the use of rote procedures. This encourages\nstudents to think about a problem before attempting to solve it.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ To provide students with a strong foundation of engineering practices.\nThere are limited opportunities in a first-year circuit analysis\ncourse to introduce students to realistic engineering experiences. We\ncontinue to take advantage of the opportunities that do exist by\nincluding problems and examples that use realistic component values\nand represent realizable circuits. We include many problems related\nto the Practical Perspective problems that begin each chapter. We\nalso include problems intended to stimulate the students' interest in\nengineering, where the problems require the type of insight typical of\na practicing engineer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e95df80d4dd3adc0f49054e91b4c10cc105dfcb","amp;dn":"Electric+Circuits+9th+Edition+-+Nilsson+Riedel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e95df80d4dd3adc0f49054e91b4c10cc105dfcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,149,223,128,212,221,58,220,15,73,5,78,145,180,193,12,193,5,223,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
