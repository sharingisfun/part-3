He does, of course, and the resulting hangover causes him to lose his job the next day. After several unsuccessful attempts to get a new job, Peter applies for welfare, only to discover that a clerical error has now made the family rich. Things spin further out of Peter&amp;#039;s control, while Lois is still unaware that her husband has been fired.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c2d2e6ef89ece166a858d6e9f900ba95cfdf32","amp;dn":"+Family+Guy+S01E01+-+Death+Has+A+Shadow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c2d2e6ef89ece166a858d6e9f900ba95cfdf32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,194,210,230,239,137,236,225,102,168,88,214,233,249,0,186,149,207,223,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
