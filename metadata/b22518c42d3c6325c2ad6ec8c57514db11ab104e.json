Since the text focuses primarily on converters, it is able to provide extensive detail of each topology and its conception. This book focuses on the PWM power converters operating in conjunction with the AC utility. The topic is important and contemporary in modern power electronics as the utilityÃ¢â‚¬â€œinterfacing power conversion becomes increasingly dominant in the power conversion applications. Since this book specifically covers subjects related to converters, it has allowed for additional room to explore the details of each topology, conception, and conceptual construction of power electronics converters. Stability, dynamic performance, compensation design of power converters, as well as broader topics such as control strategies, are among the important topics that are discussed. Some of the other unique features of the book are as follows: Introduces a new method to present power electronics converters called Power Blocks Geometry (PBG) Applicable for courses focusing on power electronics, power electronics converters, and advanced power converters Chapter 2 supplies prerequisite knowledge of power devices and basic concepts of converters, which will help undergraduate level students studying power electronics and power electronics converters follow the text Offers a comprehensive set of simulation results to help understand the circuits presented throughout the book Advanced Power Electronics Converters PWM Converters Processing AC Voltages deals with a new methodology to present an important class of electronics converters. dos Santos and da Silva provide a unique approach to the topic by considering the origins and development of power electronics converters, which will enable students to construction new topologies from the conventional ones.\nAbout the Author\nEuzeli Cipriano dos Santos Jr. is an assistant professor at Indiana UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â€œPurdue University, Indianapolis.
