Nine Inch Nails has released eight major studio releases, as well as numerous remix albums, singles with extensive b-sides, music videos, and tour documentaries. Nine Inch Nails has also contributed to numerous film soundtracks as well as the soundtrack to the video-game Quake.[1] The majority of Nine Inch Nails releases are labeled with &quot;Halo numbers&quot;, a sequential numbering system that applies to most official Nine Inch Nails releases.\n\nInitial ambitions for Nine Inch Nails in 1988 were to release one 12-inch single on a small European label.[2] With the addition of future singles &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; and &quot;Sin&quot;, many of these demo tracks would later appear in revised form on Pretty Hate Machine in 1989, co-produced by Adrian Sherwood and Mark &quot;Flood&quot; Ellis. In response to pressures from TVT Records for a follow-up to Nine Inch Nails' commercially successful debut, Reznor began recording the Broken extended play in secretÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“the EP was released in 1992.[3] Nine Inch Nails' second full-length album, The Downward Spiral, entered the Billboard 200 in 1994 at #2,[4] and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in the United States.[5]\n\nFive years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' next major album, The Fragile, a double album that debuted in September 1999 at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week.[1] Another six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth, which also debuted at the top of the Billboard 200.[6] In 2007, the band released Year Zero alongside an accompanying alternate reality game.[7] Reznor announced in late 2007 that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual obligations with Interscope Records, and would distribute its next major album independently. The last Interscope release from Nine Inch Nails was a remix album based on material from Year Zero.[8] The first Nine Inch Nails album released independently was the instrumental Ghosts IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IV in 2008, followed two months later by The Slip.\n\n\nHalo numbers\n\nHalo numbers are a system by which official Nine Inch Nails releases are chonologically ordered. They correspond to the sequence in which the releases were made, and are named by the word &quot;Halo&quot;, which precedes the number on the release. For example, the fifth Nine Inch Nails release, Broken, is identified with the phrase &quot;Halo Five&quot;. Halo numbers are sometimes modified for alternate versions of a release, such as the multiple releases of The Downward Spiral. Promotional-only releases do not have their own Halo numbers, although the promotional singles for &quot;Piggy&quot; and &quot;Hurt&quot; were both labeled as &quot;Halo Ten,&quot; a title later officially used for Further Down the Spiral. A U.S. promo for &quot;Into the Void&quot; is mislabeled as Halo 16 because this number actually belongs to the Things Falling Apart remix album.\n\nPretty Hate Machine era (1989ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1990)\n\n    * Halo 1: &quot;Down in It&quot; (1989)\n    * Halo 2: Pretty Hate Machine (1989)\n    * Halo 3: &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; (1990)\n    * Halo 4: &quot;Sin&quot; (1990)\n\nBroken era (1992ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1993)\n\n    * Halo 5: Broken (1992)\n    * Halo 6: Fixed (1992)\n\nThe Downward Spiral era (1994ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1997)\n\n    * Halo 7: &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; (1994)\n    * Halo 8: The Downward Spiral (1994)\n          o Halo 8 DE: The Downward Spiral: Deluxe Edition, reissue\n          o Halo 8 DVD-A: The Downward Spiral: DualDisc, reissue\n    * Halo 9: &quot;Closer&quot; (1994)\n    * Halo 10: Further Down the Spiral (1995)\n          o Halo 10 v2: Further Down the Spiral, European/Australian/Japanese release\n    * Halo 11: &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; (1997)\n    * Halo 12: Closure (1997)\n\nThe Fragile era (1999ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2002)\n\n    * Halo 13: &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; (1999)\n    * Halo 14: The Fragile (1999)\n    * Halo 15: &quot;We're in This Together&quot; (1999)\n    * Halo 16: Things Falling Apart (2000)\n    * Halo 17: And All That Could Have Been (2002), Limited Edition packaged with Halo 17b\n          o Halo 17a: And All That Could Have Been, Live CD\n          o Halo 17b: Still, Limited Edition Bonus CD\n\n\t\n\nWith Teeth era (2005ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2007)\n\n    * Halo 18: &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot; (2005)\n    * Halo 19: With Teeth (2005)\n          o Halo 19 DVD-A: With Teeth, DualDisc release\n    * Halo 20: &quot;Only&quot; (2005)\n    * Halo 21: &quot;Every Day Is Exactly the Same&quot; (2006)\n    * Halo 22: Beside You in Time (2007)\n          o Halo 22 HD: Beside You in Time, Live Blu-ray\n\nYear Zero era (2007)\n\n    * Halo 23: &quot;Survivalism&quot;\n    * Halo 24: Year Zero\n    * Halo 25: Year Zero Remixed\n\nGhosts era (2008)\n\n    * Halo 26: Ghosts IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IV, digital download\n          o Halo 26 CD: Ghosts IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IV, 2ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ CD\n          o Halo 26 V: Ghosts IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IV, 4ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ vinyl\n          o Halo 26 DE: Ghosts IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IV, Deluxe Edition\n          o Halo 26 LE: Ghosts IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IV, Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition\n\nThe Slip era (2008)\n\n    * Halo 27: The Slip\n          o Halo 27 CD-LE: The Slip, Limited Edition CD with bonus DVD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the most complete Nine Inch Nails Discography I could find.  \nIt includes Halo 01 to Halo 27 along with rarities.\n\nThe bitrate is variable: 128 to 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:595d5a801d37a4fe3903121b3449592e8c0af1b8","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"595d5a801d37a4fe3903121b3449592e8c0af1b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,93,90,128,29,55,164,254,57,3,18,27,52,73,89,46,140,10,241,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
