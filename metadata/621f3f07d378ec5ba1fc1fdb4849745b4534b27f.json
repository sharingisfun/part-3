Legacy of Ashes is a detailed history of the Central Intelligence Agency from its creation after World War II, through the Cold War years and the War on Terror, to its near-collapse after 9/11. The book is based on more than 50,000 documents, primarily from the archives of the CIA itself, and hundreds of interviews with CIA veterans, including ten Directors of Central Intelligence. The Wall Street Journal called the book &quot;truly extraordinary...the best book ever written on a case of espionage.&quot; Legacy of Ashes won the 2007 National Book Award for non-fiction.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:621f3f07d378ec5ba1fc1fdb4849745b4534b27f","amp;dn":"Legacy+of+Ashes%3A+The+History+of+the+CIA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"621f3f07d378ec5ba1fc1fdb4849745b4534b27f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,31,63,7,211,120,236,91,161,252,31,219,72,73,116,91,69,52,178,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
