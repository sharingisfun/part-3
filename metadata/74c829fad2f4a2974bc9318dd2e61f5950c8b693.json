Detractors will be appalled by this as well as when the book argues that fleeting negative thoughts are powerful enough to create terminal illness, poverty and even widespread disasters. The audio version of this controversial book, read by Byrne and contributing authors such as John Gray and Neale Donald Walsch, is uneven at best. The cheesy, obvious sound effects will not do much to add intellectual respectability to a work that has been widely denounced as pseudoscience. Mostly, this audio is hampered by its confusing and disjointed organizationÃ¢â‚¬â€techniques that worked reasonably well in the print version and the movie, such as cutting every few seconds from one enthusiastic expert to another, make for a choppy and somewhat bewildering listening experience. The gentle cadences of Rhonda Byrne's breathy, Aussie-infused voice are certainly the best part of the audio, but her material is scarce and provides mostly connective tissue between the testimonials. \n\n----------\n\nCreated by Yasser Adnan\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c829fad2f4a2974bc9318dd2e61f5950c8b693","amp;dn":"The+Secret+%2C+by+Rhonda+Byrne+%2C+Mobi+%2C+ePub+%2C+Pdf+%2C+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c829fad2f4a2974bc9318dd2e61f5950c8b693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,200,41,250,210,244,162,151,75,201,49,141,210,230,31,89,80,200,182,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
