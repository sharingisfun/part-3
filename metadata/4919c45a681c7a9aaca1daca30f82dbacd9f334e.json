Her knowledge of English literature, French, history, art and music is non-existent, but she has a thorough grounding in military tactics, can run a business, ride like a Cossack and shoot straight with a pistol.\n\nWhen her dear father is drowned in suspicious circumstances in the South China Sea, Sally is left to fend for herself, an orphan and alone in the smoky fog of Victorian London. Though she doesn't know it, Sally is already in terrible danger. Soon the mystery and the danger will deepen - and at the rotten heart of it all lies the deadly secret of the ruby in the smoke...\n\nBook 2: The Shadow in the North\n&quot;Fraud, fire, and bloody murder pursue Sally Lockhart in a fine sequel to\n&quot;The Ruby in the Smoke.&quot; Sally, now 22, is in business as a financial\nconsultant. When she and her friends challenge corrupt financial interests, \nthey find themselves in a web of intrigue that stretches from fetid slums of\nthe poor to the corporate offices of the richest man in Europe. Sally's\ndetective work reveals the connections between corrupt power and broken lives.\nThe action is fast, scenes are tight and dramatic, the language is vivid, and\nthe wealth of minor characters are sharply individualized. An immensely\nentertaining thriller.&quot;\n\nBook 3: The Tiger in the Well\nPullman is fast becoming a modern-day Dickens for young adults. The setting\nis the same, the strong eye for characters is there, as are the brooding\natmosphere, the social conscience, and the ability to spin plot within plot.\nSally Lockhart is now a young woman, left alone with a toddler. Nothing\nprepares her for the shock of receiving a summons from a man she has never even\nheard of, suing for divorce and the custody of her beloved Harriet. Sally\nstruggles against the net closing around her, seeking to find out who is\npersecuting her and why. The writing style is lively and direct, and there's\nlots of action. This is a suspense novel with a conscience, and a most\nenjoyable one.&quot;-- &quot;School Library Journal.\n\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Mystery | Fantasy | Adventure\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4919c45a681c7a9aaca1daca30f82dbacd9f334e","amp;dn":"Philip+Pullman+-+Sally+Lockhart+series+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4919c45a681c7a9aaca1daca30f82dbacd9f334e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,25,196,90,104,28,122,154,172,161,218,202,48,248,45,186,205,159,51,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
