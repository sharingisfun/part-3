Is warfare on a path to ever greater\ndestructive force? This magisterial new account answers these questions\nby tracing the history of Western thinking about strategy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the employment\nof military force as a political instrument Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from antiquity to the\npresent day. Assessing sources from Vegetius to contemporary America,\nand with a particular focus on strategy since the Napoleonic Wars,\nBeatrice Heuser explores the evolution of strategic thought, the social\ninstitutions, norms and patterns of behaviour within which it operates,\nthe policies that guide it and the culture that influences it. Ranging across\ntechnology and warfare, total warfare and small wars as well as land,\nsea, air and nuclear warfare, she demonstrates that warfare and strategic\nthinking have fluctuated wildly in their aims, intensity, limitations and\nexcesses over the past two millennia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78a0ca6db7c84c1e521e4f7417b1ce864f0a0770","amp;dn":"The+Evolution+of+Strategy%3A+Thinking+War+%282010%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78a0ca6db7c84c1e521e4f7417b1ce864f0a0770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,160,202,109,183,200,76,30,82,30,79,116,23,177,206,134,79,10,7,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
