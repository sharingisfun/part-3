Bailey Rae supported the album with the World Tour 2006/2007.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Denise Sheppard - When soul music is at its finest, a great vocalist can take you along on a journey into their sadness, loneliness, joy, and passion. When mixing that voice with horns, harmonies, and a bluesy Hammond organ, that same music can seamlessly travel across decades. Many new artists claim to accomplish that feat, but few are sincerely ageless and timeless: Corinne Bailey Rae has those qualities in spades. Rae--a newcomer out of Leeds, UK, with a gospel choir history--has created a self-titled CD that occasionally evokes the feeling of a '70s Bill Withers classic, while bringing inflections of Zero 7 and Alicia Keys to her grooves as well. Straight from track one, &quot;Like a Star&quot; displays a restrained soulfulness that shows her strengths through a whisper soft melody. Other standout cuts include the breakup-ache of &quot;Till It Happens To You&quot; and &quot;Choux Pastry Heart,&quot; which discloses her jazz-affected timing and the level of powerful songwriting that she is capable of at her very best. In a day and age where a good voice alone can provide you with a golden ticket, it is refreshing to see that Rae has not only written or cowritten every song on her debut, she also contributes guitar, bass, keys, and percussion to the tracks. Her songs have some room to mature, but as a new recording artist in her mid-20s, so does she. Soul lovers, pass the word: this is one impressive debut. \n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Like A Star \n[02] Enchantment \n[03] Put Your Records On \n[04] Till It Happens To You \n[05] Trouble Sleeping \n[06] Call Me When You Get This \n[07] Choux Pastry Heart \n[08] Breathless \n[09] I'd Like To \n[10] Butterfly \n[11] Seasons Change\n\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:45m:53s\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 116mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v7.6.1.9 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop \n\nRelease Date\t&gt; 24 February 2006\n\nRecord Company\t&gt; EMI Records \n\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.corinnebaileyrae.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.corinnebaileyrae.net&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinne_Bailey_Rae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinne_Bailey_Rae&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.azlyrics.com/c/corinnebaileyrae.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.azlyrics.com/c/corinnebaileyrae.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.muzu.tv/corinnebaileyrae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.muzu.tv/corinnebaileyrae&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a056d710ca58a75902ee561c18286d7f5fa70924","amp;dn":"%5B2006%5D+Corinne+Bailey+Rae+-+Corinne+Bailey+Rae+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1jo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a056d710ca58a75902ee561c18286d7f5fa70924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,86,215,16,202,88,167,89,2,238,86,28,24,40,109,127,95,167,9,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
