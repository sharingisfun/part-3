Robinson\n\nTaught By Professor Daniel N. Robinson, Ph.D., City University of New York,\nPhilosophy Faculty, Oxford University; Distinguished Professor, Emeritus, Georgetown University\n\nHumanity left childhood and entered the troubled but productive world when it started to criticize its own certainties and weigh the worthiness of its most secure beliefs. Thus began that &quot;Long Debate&quot; on the nature of truth, the scale of real values, the life one should aspire to live, the character of justice, the sources of law, the terms of civic and political lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the good, the better, the best.\n\nThe debate continues, and one remains aloof to it at a very heavy price, for &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living.&quot;\n\nThis course of 60 lectures gives the student a sure guide and interpreter as the major themes within the Long Debate are presented and considered. The persistent themes are understood as problems:\n\nThe problem of knowledge, arising from concerns as to how or whether we come to know anything, and are justified in our belief that this knowledge is valid and sound\nThe problem of conduct, arising from the recognition that our actions, too, require some sort of justification in light of our moral and ethical sensibilitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or lack of them\nThe problem of governance, which includes an understanding of sources of law and its binding nature.\nThe great speculators of history have exhausted themselves on these problems and have bequeathed to us a storehouse of insights, some so utterly persuasive as to have shaped thought itself. In these coherent and beautifully articulated lectures you will hear Plato and Aristotle, the Stoics and Epicureans, the Scholastic philosophers and the leaders of Renaissance thought.\n\nIn addition, you will learn about the architects of the Age of Newton and the Enlightenment that followed in its wakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all this, as well as Romanticism and Continental thought, Nietzsche and Darwin, Freud and William James. This course is a veritable banquet of enriching reflection on mental life and the acts of humanity that proceed from it: the plans and purposes, the values and beliefs, the possibilities and vulnerabilities.\n\nA Great Teacher\n\nThis course is the integration of a lifelong student of these issues who has thought and published in every area covered by these lectures. Professor Robinson is one of those rare teachers whose tremendous respect for his audience, vast expertise, relish for language, and engaging rhetorical flair create an exceptionally enjoyable learning environment.\n\nDr. Robinson's lectures make the ideas of philosophy thrilling, passionate, human, and divine. Customers agree: &quot;Professor Robinson explains multiple disciplines like no one since Aristotle. His scope is awesome. A professor's professor.&quot; Another writes: &quot;Enjoying these tapes is one of the most rewarding experiences of my life at this time.&quot;\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n1.\tFrom the Upanishads to Homer\n2.\t PhilosophyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Did the Greeks Invent It?\n3.\t Pythagoras and the Divinity of Number\n4.\tWhat Is There?\n5.\t The Greek Tragedians on ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fate\n6.\t Herodotus and the Lamp of History\n7.\t Socrates on the Examined Life\n8.\tPlato's Search For Truth\n9.\t Can Virtue Be Taught?\n10.\tPlato's RepublicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Man Writ Large\n11.\t Hippocrates and the Science of Life\n12.\tAristotle on the Knowable\n13.\t Aristotle on Friendship\n14.\t Aristotle on the Perfect Life\n15.\tRome, the Stoics, and the Rule of Law\n16.\tThe Stoic Bridge to Christianity\n17.\tRoman LawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Making a City of the Once-Wide World\n18.\tThe Light WithinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Augustine on Human Nature\n19.\t Islam\n20.\t Secular KnowledgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Idea of University\n21.\tThe Reappearance of Experimental Science\n22.\t Scholasticism and the Theory of Natural Law\n23.\tThe RenaissanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Was There One?\n24.\tLet Us Burn the Witches to Save Them\n25.\t Francis Bacon and the Authority of Experience\n26.\t Descartes and the Authority of Reason\n27.\t NewtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Saint of Science\n28.\tHobbes and the Social Machine\n29.\t LockeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Newtonian Science of the Mind\n30.\tNo matter?
