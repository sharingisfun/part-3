Burka, Lenora M. Yuen\r\n\r\nOverview: Based on their workshops and counseling experience, psychologists Jane B. Burka and Lenora M. Yuen offer a probing, sensitive, and at times humorous look at a problem that affects everyone: students and scientists, secretaries and executives, homemakers and salespeople. Procrastination identifies the reasons we put off tasksâ€”fears of failure, success, control, separation, and attachmentâ€”and their roots in our childhood and adult experiences. The authors offer a practical, tested program to overcome procrastination by achieving set goals, managing time, enlisting support, and handling stress. Burka and Yuen even provide tips on living and working with the procrastinators you may know","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d07329e84a21a135c56646b1a938b61e393b5d05","amp;dn":"Procrastination%3A+Why+You+Do+It%2C+What+to+Do+About+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d07329e84a21a135c56646b1a938b61e393b5d05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,115,41,232,74,33,161,53,197,102,70,177,169,56,182,30,57,59,93,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
