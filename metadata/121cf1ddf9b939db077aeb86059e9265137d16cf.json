The fear of mispronouncing or misusing complex words is real and leaves many of us consigned to the lower levels* of the English Language.\nThe secret to eloquence, however, lies in simplicityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the ability to use ordinary words in extraordinary ways.\n\nThe Well-Spoken Thesaurus is your guide to eloquence, replacing the ordinary with the extraordinary. While a common thesaurus provides only synonyms as mere word-for-word equivalents, The Well-Spoken Thesaurus is filled with* dynamic reinventions of standard words and phrases.\n\n*lofty word, pretentious word\n*know what it is to\n*lower reaches, lower echelons\n*awash in, instilled with, dense with, rich in\n\nIn this unconventional, easy-to-use thesaurus, Heehler, a degree student at the Harvard Extension School, invites the reader to speak like an academic without sounding like one.

Tom Heehler has, however, created and brought to life a thesaurus for spoken English. One word came to me after I had made my first visit to its 392 pages: Wow!The Well-Spoken Thesaurus is a fascinating and provocative resource for lecturers or speakers of the English language of all sizes, ages, and social classes. I vow neither to lend nor sell the copy that came to me a few days ago. It is simply too convenient, too daring, too lively, invaluable. One wonders, &quot;Why didn't someone think of such a resource as this a long time ago?&quot;\n-- Raymond Rundus, Professor Emeritus of English at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke\n\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING..\n\n&quot;LIVE AND LET LIVE&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:121cf1ddf9b939db077aeb86059e9265137d16cf","amp;dn":"The+Well-Spoken+Thesaurus-The+Most+Powerful+Ways+to+Say+Everyday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"121cf1ddf9b939db077aeb86059e9265137d16cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,28,241,221,249,185,57,219,7,122,235,134,5,158,146,101,19,125,22,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
