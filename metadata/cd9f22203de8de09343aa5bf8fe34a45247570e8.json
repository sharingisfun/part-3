What he reveals is a fascinating, terrifying mess. \n\nDoctors and patients need good scientific evidence to make informed decisions. But instead, companies run bad trials on their own drugs, which distort and exaggerate the benefits by design. When these trials produce unflattering results, the data is simply buried. All of this is perfectly legal. In fact, even government regulators withhold vitally important data from the people who need it most. Doctors and patient groups have stood by too, and failed to protect us. Instead, they take money and favours, in a world so fractured that medics and nurses are now educated by the drugs industry.\n\nThe result: patients are harmed in huge numbers.\n\nBen Goldacre is BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest writer on the science behind medicine, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœBad PharmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the book that finally prompted Parliament to ask why all trial results arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t made publicly available Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this edition has been updated with the latest news from the select committee hearings. Let the witty and indefatigable Goldacre show you how medicine went wrong, and what you can do to mend it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd9f22203de8de09343aa5bf8fe34a45247570e8","amp;dn":"Ben+Goldacre+-+Bad+Pharma%3A+How+drug+companies+mislead+doctors+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd9f22203de8de09343aa5bf8fe34a45247570e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,159,34,32,61,232,222,9,52,58,165,191,143,227,74,69,36,117,112,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
