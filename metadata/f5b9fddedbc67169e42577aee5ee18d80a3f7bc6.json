Ever since their 1998-debut Ã‚Â»Steelbath SuicideÃ‚Â«, the Helsingborg-based band set their own bars higher with each new creation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cementing their distinct sound. With Ã‚Â»The Living InfiniteÃ‚Â«, SOILWORK brought their mix of modern, melodic and progressive metal to yet another level, releasing the first dual-disc of the band history Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the genre itself.\nAfter Ã‚Â»The Living InfiniteÃ‚Â« came out on March 01, 2013, SOILWORK saw an international march of triumph, gaining world-wide chart recognition, entering the Top 20 in Finland, Germany, Switzerland and their native Sweden!\nNow SOILWORK announce the release of a very special Live DVD: Ã‚Â»Live In The Heart Of HelsinkiÃ‚Â« was recorded on March 21, 2014 at Circus, Helsinki Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Finland has been a second home to the band for many years now, so the choice of the venue was an obvious one.\nHighlights of the career spanning live set without a doubt are the guest performances by friends Floor Jansen (NIGHTWISH, REVAMP) and Nathan J. Biggs (SONIC SYNDICATE).\nStated SOILWORK singer BjÃƒÂ¶rn Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpeedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Strid: Ã¢â‚¬Å“There could've not been a better time than now, with 10 albums out and a very varied back catalogue to choose from. Our line up now is 50 % original members and 50 % fresh blood, which makes it all more interesting. Especially since the newest members have brought so much to our sound and have continued to inspire us to write new and exciting music and also brought a new found energy on stage.. Now is definitely the time to see us. Trust me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nProduced by Jouni Markkanen and directed by Ville LiapiÃƒÂ¤nen (known for directing NIGHTWISHÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã‚Â»Showtime, StorytimeÃ‚Â«), Ã‚Â»Live In The Heart Of HelsinkiÃ‚Â« will be released on March 13, 2015 via Nuclear Blast and will be available as a BluRay +2CD Digi and DVD+2CD Digi\n\nTrackList\n\n01.
