They bathe together, sleep together, and spend most nights cuddled on the couch watching TV together. Gabby is mentally disabled, and since their mother is estranged, Chelli is her sole caretaker. After realizing Chelli is working as a security guard and leaving Gabby unsupervised at home, a social worker enrolls Gabby in a day-care program. The sisters' separation creates a distance in their relationship, which is perpetuated by a new man in Chelli's life. This intense, gritty film explores a complex symbiotic relationship that teeters on the line between nurture and torture and doesn't shy away from forcing viewers to confront the uncomfortable sexual situations in which the characters find themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x428, 25.000 fps, 2084 Kbps, 01h25m44s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 448 kbps\r\nAudio: Vorbis, 48000 Hz, stereo\r\nRatio: 2.40:1\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Hebrew audio with commentary track, subtitles English, Hebrew, Russian\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/vwdqzh5r5/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/j64y9o6j5/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/mr0tswb2p/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/xrvyxx3bl/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/fdlftxr0x/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42ac260704d897ee53d36ec4446e7619db2622dc","amp;dn":"Next+to+Her+-+At+Li+Layla+%5B2014+-+Israel%5D+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42ac260704d897ee53d36ec4446e7619db2622dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,172,38,7,4,216,151,238,83,211,110,196,68,110,118,25,219,38,34,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
