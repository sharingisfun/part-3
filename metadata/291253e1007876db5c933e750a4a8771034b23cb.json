Mathematically oriented, the book presents every theorem alongside a proof. \n\n The material is presented clearly and every concept is illustrated with concrete examples from a broad range of disciplines. With numerous exercises the book is a thorough and extensive guide to game theory from undergraduate through graduate courses in economics, mathematics, computer science, engineering and life sciences to being an authoritative reference for researchers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:291253e1007876db5c933e750a4a8771034b23cb","amp;dn":"Game+Theory+%282013%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"291253e1007876db5c933e750a4a8771034b23cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,18,83,225,0,120,118,219,92,147,62,117,10,74,135,113,3,75,35,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
