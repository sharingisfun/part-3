Most people will see a comparison with Mumford &amp; Sons and there is a similar vibe. If you like some great outdoors music to have a drink with in the nice sunny evenings then this is it!\nMighty Oaks is comprised of Ian Hopper (vocals, mandolin, acoustic guitar, kick drum) from the U.S., Claudio Donzelle (vocals, banjo, guitars, mandolin, keyboard/piano) from Italy, and Craig Saunders (vocals, bass) from the U.K. Two mandolins!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0dca42bff4f2bb053524bc0a12e66a32946ed60","amp;dn":"Mighty+Oaks+-+Howl+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0dca42bff4f2bb053524bc0a12e66a32946ed60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,220,164,43,255,79,43,176,83,82,75,192,161,46,102,163,41,70,237,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
