Now, 12 albums and almost 20 years into a solid career, Bowling for Soup are challenging that notion with Lunch. Drunk. Love., an album that finds the band tempering the brashness of youth with the kind of confidence that comes with age and experience.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FNkDWSv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FNkDWSv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a1225c71ed655be8ae5b263c8404bf912411706","amp;dn":"Bowling+For+Soup+-+Lunch.+Drunk.+Love.+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a1225c71ed655be8ae5b263c8404bf912411706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,18,37,199,30,214,85,190,138,229,178,99,200,64,75,249,18,65,23,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
