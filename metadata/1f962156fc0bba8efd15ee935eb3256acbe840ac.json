What they have in common is a hunch about human psychology: that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our constant effort to eliminate the negative that causes us to feel so anxious, insecure, and unhappy. And that there is an alternative Ã¢â‚¬Å“negative pathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to happiness and success that involves embracing the things we spend our lives trying to avoid. It is a subversive, galvanizing message, which turns out to have a long and distinguished philosophical lineage ranging from ancient Roman Stoic philosophers to Buddhists. Oliver Burkeman talks to life coaches paid to make their clientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives a living hell, and to maverick security experts such as Bruce Schneier, who contends that the changes weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made to airport and aircraft security since the 9/11 attacks have actually made us less safe. And then there are the Ã¢â‚¬Å“backwardsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ business gurus, who suggest not having any goals at all and not planning for a companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future.\n\n \n\nBurkemanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new book is a witty, fascinating, and counterintuitive read that turns decades of self-help advice on its head and forces us to rethink completely our attitudes toward failure, uncertainty, and death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f962156fc0bba8efd15ee935eb3256acbe840ac","amp;dn":"The+Antidote+-+Happiness+for+People+Who+Can%27t+Stand+Positive+Thi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f962156fc0bba8efd15ee935eb3256acbe840ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,150,33,86,252,11,186,142,253,21,238,147,94,179,37,106,203,232,64,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
