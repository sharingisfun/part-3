American Football, the groups album debut, may not hit quite the same heights, but it comes close enough that no one should be bothered; Mike Kinsella treads the same brightly arpeggiated post-emo territory his brother Tim Kinsella does with Joan of Arc (albeit without the abstraction). The obvious progression from the Polyvinyl single comes in the form of horns and Wurlizter dabbed tastefully onto a few tracks; when the band picks up into more conventionally driving territory, things are still appealing -- but Kinsellas main strength seems to be in drifting, floating waves of melody, and American Football makes good on this in a pretty impressive way.\n\nReleased: 1999\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: 192kbps\nCodec: MP3\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
