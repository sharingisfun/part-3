In that sense it is a dystopia, though not so far from our own day and time; only a few steps beyond where we are now. The students are cowed but not unaware, and they seize the opportunity to make a difference when their smarts and courage allow it. And so they change the world.\r\n\r\nThis is Book 1 of Substrate Wars, the series: A growing band of campus freedom-fighters discover a new technology that could either destroy the world, or save it. They take on the responsibility of using it for good. Homeland Security is one step behind them. Spies and traitors lurk. Shall it be repressive bureaucratic stagnation, or expansion to the stars","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:796a943949e74b5675c0b6c1fb9ae322d9013dfc","amp;dn":"Jeb+Kinnison-Red+Queen%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"796a943949e74b5675c0b6c1fb9ae322d9013dfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,106,148,57,73,231,75,86,117,192,182,193,251,154,227,34,217,1,61,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
