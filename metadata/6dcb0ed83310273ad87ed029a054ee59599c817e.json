In this course, we will make learning the basics of color fun and easy to understand.\nFirst weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll break down color and learn three different ways to describe it. Next weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn about additive and subtractive color models before spending some time with the color wheel learning about color harmonies and color temperature. We will wrap things up by learning how color relationships affect our perception of color and how color can affect our moods and emotions.\nAfter completing this course, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have a solid foundation of color knowledge on which to build going forward with your creative career.\n\nTutor\nEddie Russell\n9 Lessons\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dcb0ed83310273ad87ed029a054ee59599c817e","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Color+Theory+for+Today%27s+Creative+Professionals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dcb0ed83310273ad87ed029a054ee59599c817e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,203,14,216,51,16,39,58,216,126,208,41,160,84,238,89,89,156,129,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
