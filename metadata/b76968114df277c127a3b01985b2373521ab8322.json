PLEASE UPLOAD it\n\n\n\nOnly Fools and Horses.S04E03-Hole in One\n\n\nBrief: while filming the first episode, disaster struck, one of the central characters, \n\nGrandad had died. The challenge....to bury one of your central characters in a comedy.\n \nIt seemed impossible, but Sullivan pulled it off in a legendry way. Even though they \n\nhad filmed the first episode with Grandad, Uncle Albert was introduced and the comedy \n\nmaturely survived.\nTo this day the original Grandad episode, &quot;Hole in one&quot;, has never been shown.\n\n\nOnly Fools and Horses.S04E09-To Hull and Back\t\t(90 Min Film)\n\nBrief: Just a simple courier job says Boycie and Abdul but the Trotter&amp;#039;s life on the \n\nocean wave doesn&amp;#039;t go completely to plan. They run into their old friend Slater &amp;#039;The \n\nSlag&amp;#039; but it isn&amp;#039;t all plain sailing for him either.\n\nBoycie and Abdul pitch a diamond scam to Del Boy, who immediately turns them down.\nThat is until they offer him a Ã‚Â£15,000 cut of the estimated Ã‚Â£150,000 sale of the stone \n\non the UK market. Del finds himself designated as the courier between Holland and \n\nBritain.\nNo sooner has Del enlisted a reluctant Rodders, he hears his old foil Chief Inspector \n\nSlater is eyeing Boycie and Abdul as drug dealers. Del decides to hide undetected in \n\nthe back of Denzil&amp;#039;s van.\nDenzil then getting in and driving them to Hull (pursued by Rodney) was not part of the \n\nplan. Thinking quickly, they hire a boat, and let Uncle Albert guide them to Amsterdam.\nOvercoming counterfeit cash, Albert&amp;#039;s amnesia, it&amp;#039;s only the arrival of Slater that \n\nscuppers them. Despite this, it&amp;#039;s Del who has the last laugh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b76968114df277c127a3b01985b2373521ab8322","amp;dn":"Only+Fools+and+Horses+Season+4-OnlyMe1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b76968114df277c127a3b01985b2373521ab8322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,105,104,17,77,242,119,193,39,163,176,25,133,178,55,53,33,171,131,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
