Other Linux distributions may be supported as described in the Linux System Requirements. The road map reflects the current plans of MathWorks and is subject to change without notice.\n\nSee the platform road map for Polyspace products.\nSupported Platform Changes\n\nMathWorks periodically updates platform support and is planning the following platform changes:\n\n    32-bit Linux platform drop: As of R2012b, 32-bit Linux will be dropped as a supported platform. 32-bit Linux users should begin migrating to 64-bit Linux or an alternate platform at this time. 64-bit Linux will continue as a supported platform.\n    Lion (Mac OS X 10.7) add: As of R2011a, Lion (Mac OS X 10.7) is supported.\n\nSupported Compiler Changes\n\nMathWorks refreshes its compiler support every release, occasionally dropping support for an older version of a compiler in favor of a newer and more readily available version. MathWorks is planning the following compiler changes:\n\n    Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express: Support will be dropped as of R2012a; Windows SDK v7.1 will be the supported free Microsoft tool chain going forward.\n    Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Professional: Support will be dropped as of R2011b.\n    Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0: Support will be dropped as of R2012a.\n    Intel C++ and Fortran Compilers: Support for v11.1 will be dropped as of R2012a. Support for v12.0 is anticipated beginning with R2011b.\n\n\n\nFor more info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/roadmap.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/roadmap.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61087b37a3edcc516c2c97446b1275c0fc9aea63","amp;dn":"Matlab+2011a+Windows+32+%26amp%3B+64+.+With+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61087b37a3edcc516c2c97446b1275c0fc9aea63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,8,123,55,163,237,204,81,108,44,151,68,107,18,117,192,252,154,234,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
