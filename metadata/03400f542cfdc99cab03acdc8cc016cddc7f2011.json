Dzogchen is a path of self-liberation. It is not a path of renunciation or transformation, but rather one of seeing directly the nature of mind, as pointed put by a teacher who has realized this freedom for him or herself. This video gives the student the opportunity to receive these teachings from an accomplished guide.\n\n\nfrom wikipedia -\n\nAccording to Tibetan Buddhism, Dzogchen is the natural, primordial state or natural condition of the mind, and a body of teachings and meditation practices aimed at realizing that condition. Dzogchen, or &quot;Great Perfection&quot;, is a central teaching of the Nyingma school also practiced by adherents of other Tibetan Buddhist sects.
