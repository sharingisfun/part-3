With his seductive singles for Hi Records in the early '70s, Green bridged the gap between deep soul and smooth Philadelphia soul. He incorporated elements of gospel, interjecting his performances with wild moans and wails, but his records were stylish, boasting immaculate productions that rolled along with a tight beat, sexy backing vocals, and lush strings. The distinctive Hi Records sound that the vocalist and producer Willie Mitchell developed made Al Green the most popular and influential soul singer of the early '70s, influencing not only his contemporaries, but also veterans like Marvin Gaye. Green was at the peak of his popularity when he suddenly decided to join the ministry in the mid-'70s. At first, he continued to record secular material, but by the '80s, he was concentrating solely on gospel. During the late '80s and '90s, he occasionally returned to R&amp;B, but he remained primarily a religious performer for the rest of his career. Nevertheless, Green's classic early- '70s recordings retained their power and influence throughout the decades, setting the standard for smooth soul. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tMusic Club Deluxe\nCatalog:\t\tMCDLX008\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01.Livin' For You\n02.Free At Last\n03.Tired Of Being Alone\n04.So Good To Be Here\n05.Unchained Melody\n06.I'm Still In Love With You\n07.Love And Happiness\n08.For The Good Times\n09.Look What You Done For Me\n10.Let's Stay Together\n11.I Gotta To Be More (Take Me Higher)\n12.Let It Shine\n13.Something\n14.Oh Me Oh My (Dreams In My Arms)\n15.I'm Hooked On You\n16.I Tried To Tell Myself\n17.Let's Get Married\n18.The Letter\n19.Call Me (Come Back Home)\n\n\nCD 2\n\n01.Here I Am (Come And Take Me)\n02.How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\n03.Belle\n04.Schooldays\n05.Hangin' On\n06.Have You Been Makin' Out Ok\n07.One Woman\n08.Never Found A Girl (Who Loves Me Like You Do)\n09.Sha La La (Make Me Happy)\n10.Take Me To The River\n11.Love Ritual\n12.Simply Beautiful\n13.For The Good Times\n14.I Can't Get Next To You\n15.L.O.V.E.
