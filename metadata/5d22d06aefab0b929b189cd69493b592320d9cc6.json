Alice is a bored, spoiled high schooler with a gorgeous body and a sociopathic mind. She persuades one of her suitors, the naive and trusting Luc, to murder another suitor, the handsome, rakish Said. The criminal act itself, though exceedingly messy, proves to be the easy part, as disposing of the body becomes the much thornier problem. They throw the corpse in the truck of Luc&amp;#039;s parents&amp;#039; car and drive to a creepy forested area in Provence. In their haste to bury the body, they lose their way. Without warm clothes or food, they wander deeper into the forest until they happen upon a seemingly deserted shack. At this point, the film&amp;#039;s narrative suddenly mutates from its Badlands-like beginning into a bizarre, horrifying version of Hansel and Gretel. When the resident of the hut returns, he rousts them at gun point into the cellar dungeon, where to their horror they find Said&amp;#039;s exhumed cadaver -- missing a leg. It soon becomes apparent that the hermit plans to cook and eat the couple, but not before making Luc his sex slave. Alice quickly realizes that the world does not bend to her whims. Influenced by both Luis Bunuel and Jean-Luc Godard, Ozon&amp;#039;s wickedly baroque film is an assault on the listless bourgeoisie and an exploration of the pitch-black corners of the soul. This film was screened at the 1999 Toronto Film Festival.\n-All Movie Guide\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d22d06aefab0b929b189cd69493b592320d9cc6","amp;dn":"Francois+Ozon+-+Les+Amants+Criminels+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d22d06aefab0b929b189cd69493b592320d9cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,34,208,106,239,171,11,146,155,24,156,214,148,147,181,146,50,13,156,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
