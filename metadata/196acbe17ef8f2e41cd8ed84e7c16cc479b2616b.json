Since computers are unlikely to be skilled at producing something as sophisticated as humor, &quot;Hangover&quot; is missing that element which makes much of the best recent party music stand out. Instead we have simplistic words celebrating drinking too much and throwing up with none of the wordplay of something as masterful as &quot;Like a G6.&quot; The lyrics for Taio Cruz' massive hit &quot;Dynamite&quot; were insipid. Here the words become offensive.\n\n\n\n#########################\n\n\nPlease seed !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:196acbe17ef8f2e41cd8ed84e7c16cc479b2616b","amp;dn":"Taio+Cruz+-+Hangover+featuring+Flo+Rida","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"196acbe17ef8f2e41cd8ed84e7c16cc479b2616b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,106,203,225,126,248,242,228,28,216,237,132,231,193,108,196,121,178,97,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
