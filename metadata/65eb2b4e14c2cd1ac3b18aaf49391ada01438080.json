It will\nbe the most commonly used technology among\ncomputer networks in the near future. They provide a\nlot of freedom but not without cost: All too many\nhome and corporate wireless networks are left wide\nopen for attack\n\nThis course takes an in-depth look at the security challenges\nof many different wireless technologies, exposing you to wireless\nsecurity threats through the eyes of an attacker. Using\nreadily available and custom-developed tools, you will navigate\nyour way through the techniques attackers use to exploit Wi-Fi\nnetworks, including attacks againstWEP, WPA/WPA2, WPSand other\nsystems\n\nUsing assessment and analysis techniques, this\ncourse will show you how to identify the threats\nthat expose wireless technology and build on this\nknowledge to implement defensive techniques that can\nbe used to protect wireless systems\n\nIn this course we teach everything fromscratchandno\npre-existing knowledgeis needed. So as long as you\nhave a working internet connection, a wireless router and a\ncomputer/laptop you are good to go\n\nWith 25 modules for this course and Challenge Assignments for\ntopics, we make sure you understand the topic from the ground\nup to the deep packet level","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65eb2b4e14c2cd1ac3b18aaf49391ada01438080","amp;dn":"UDEMY+ULTIMATE+WI-FI+HACKING+AND+SECURITY+SERIES+TUTORIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65eb2b4e14c2cd1ac3b18aaf49391ada01438080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,235,43,78,20,194,205,26,195,177,138,175,73,57,26,218,1,67,128,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
