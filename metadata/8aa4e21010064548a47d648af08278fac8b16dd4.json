As a result, our country has generally worked to keep the military out of law enforcement. But according to investigative reporter Radley Balko, over the last several decades, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cops have increasingly come to resemble ground troops. The consequences have been dire: the home is no longer a place of sanctuary, the Fourth Amendment has been gutted, and police today have been conditioned to see the citizens they serve as an otherÃ¢â‚¬â€an enemy.\n\nTodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s armored-up policemen are a far cry from the constables of early America. The unrest of the 1960s brought about the invention of the SWAT unitÃ¢â‚¬â€which in turn led to the debut of military tactics in the ranks of police officers. NixonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War on Drugs, ReaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War on Poverty, ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s COPS program, the postÃ¢â‚¬â€œ9/11 security state under Bush and Obama: by degrees, each of these innovations expanded and empowered police forces, always at the expense of civil liberties. And these are just four among a slew of reckless programs.\n\nIn Rise of the Warrior Cop, Balko shows how politiciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ill-considered policies and relentless declarations of war against vague enemies like crime, drugs, and terror have blurred the distinction between cop and soldier. His fascinating, frightening narrative shows how over a generation, a creeping battlefield mentality has isolated and alienated American police officers and put them on a collision course with the values of a free society.&quot;\n\nReviews:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Mr Balko manages to avoid the clichÃƒÂ©s of both right and left, and provokes genuine outrage at the misuse of state power in its most brutal and unaccountable form: heavily armed police raiding the homes of unarmed, non-violent suspects on the flimsiest of pretexts, and behaving more like an occupying army in hostile territory than guardians of public safety. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rise of the Warrior CopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Mr BalkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interesting first book, explains what policies led to the militarisation of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s police. To his credit, he focuses his outrage not on the police themselves, but on politicians and the phoney, wasteful drug war they created.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -The Economist\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Rise of the Warrior Cop diagnoses a grave threat to our constitutional rights. If Americans still possess the wisdom of our Founders, we will heed BalkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warning and turn back our drift towards a police state.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ -American Conservative\n\nThis torrent contains retail EPUB and MOBI versions of the book as well as a scanned PDF copy.
