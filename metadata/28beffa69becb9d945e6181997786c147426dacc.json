Learn how to build your own JavaBeans and get developer tips for developing enterprise-level applications that are scalable cross-compatible, and less demanding of server resources. In this course Patrick Royal covers the core concepts behind JavaBeans and explores the syntax, commands, and tools you need to know. He shows how to create session and entity objects, build server-side code, design objects to take advantage of parallel processing, and improve your code with optimization techniques and extensions. He also issues several JavaBeans programming challenges that allow you to test your knowledge along the way.\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n* Building your first simple JavaBeans component\n\n* Creating simple entity beans and message-driven beans\n\n* Defining a primary key\n\n* Understanding the life cycle of beans\n\n* Creating home and component interfaces\n\n* Controlling concurrent access to JavaBeans objects\n\n* Debugging and optimizing JavaBeans code\n\n* Enabling security and encryption\n\n* Creating asynchronous methods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28beffa69becb9d945e6181997786c147426dacc","amp;dn":"%5BLynda%5D+Java+EE+JavaBeans+Tutorial-KTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28beffa69becb9d945e6181997786c147426dacc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,190,255,166,155,236,185,217,69,230,24,25,151,120,108,20,116,38,218,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
