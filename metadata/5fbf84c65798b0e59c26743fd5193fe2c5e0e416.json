I hope that fifty years from now, this film is used as reference in a musical and even a sociological sense. Color and b+w both fit well here. The music is arresting and intense, the imagery fits the music and the pace. Anyone who likes well made documentaries should see this. Throughout the film, there are quick sketches of people in line that coincide with pieces of music. This is my favorite part. This might be hard to find, but keep an eye out for it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fbf84c65798b0e59c26743fd5193fe2c5e0e416","amp;dn":"Instrument+%282003%29+Fugazi+DVD+Jem+Cohen+115min","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fbf84c65798b0e59c26743fd5193fe2c5e0e416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,191,132,198,87,152,176,229,156,38,116,63,213,25,63,226,197,224,228,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
