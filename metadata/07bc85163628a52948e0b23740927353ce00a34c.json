Discovery of two-dimensional (2D) materials, the thinnest form of materials to ever occur in nature, is one of them. After isolation of graphene from graphite in 2004, a whole other class of atomically thin materials, dominated by surface effects and showing completely unexpected and extraordinary properties, has been created. This book provides a comprehensive view and state-of-the-art knowledge about 2D materials such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) and so on. It consists of 11 chapters contributed by a team of experts in this exciting field and provides latest synthesis techniques of 2D materials, characterization and their potential applications in energy conservation, electronics, optoelectronics and biotechnology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07bc85163628a52948e0b23740927353ce00a34c","amp;dn":"Two-dimensional+Material+-+Synthesis%2C+Characterization+and+Poten","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07bc85163628a52948e0b23740927353ce00a34c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,188,133,22,54,40,165,41,72,224,178,55,64,146,115,83,206,0,163,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
