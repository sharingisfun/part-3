This is a lighthearted book with a serious purpose: to question the assumptions behind the dogma and sheer hype that the dominant school of neoliberal economists-the apostles of the freemarket-have spun since the Age of Reagan.\n \nChang, the author of the international bestseller Bad Samaritans, is one of the world's most respected economists, a voice of sanity-and wit-in the tradition of John Kenneth Galbraith and Joseph Stiglitz. 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism equips readers with an understanding of how global capitalism works-and doesn't. In his final chapter, &quot;How to Rebuild the World,&quot; Chang offers a vision of how we can shape capitalism to humane ends, instead of becoming slaves of the market.\n \nHa-Joon Chang teaches in the Faculty of Economics at the University of Cambridge. His books include the bestselling Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism. His Kicking Away the Ladder received the 2003 Myrdal Prize, and, in 2005, Chang was awarded the Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12ca2ca709c1dade9cc6c066173a688a5c1e7b08","amp;dn":"23+Things+They+Don%27t+Tell+You+About+Capitalism.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12ca2ca709c1dade9cc6c066173a688a5c1e7b08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,202,44,167,9,193,218,222,156,198,192,102,23,58,104,138,92,30,123,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
