Blakney {1955}\nLao Tzu\n{approx 500 BC}\n\nWeb Publication by Mountain Man Graphics, Australia in the Southern Summer of 1995\n\nTranslators Notes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nThe following notations have been gleaned from the commentary of the translator, Raymond Blakney, in 1955 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nThe identity of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mystics is complicated by the rule that no true mystic would know himself to be such.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere there is no author, however, it is necessary to invent one; and by the time the Tao Te Ching had been put in form, legend had supplied Lao Tzu, and Ssu-ma ChÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ien incorporated the legend in his Historical Records (Chap.63). It presents Lao Tzu correctly enough as one who had given up civilised and is impatient with Confucian ideas and who accordingly departs for points unknown, presumably to live out life as a recluse.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œConfucius came to Chou to consult old Lao Tzu about ritual.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ [and spoke of the heroes of old ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦]\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLao Tzu said, All those men of whom you speak have long since mouldered away with their bones.\nOnly their words remain.\nWhen a capable manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time comes, he rises; if it does not, then he wanders wearily around.\nI have heard that good merchants keep their goods buried deeply to make it look as if they had none,\nand that a superior man whose character is perfected will feign stupidity.\nGive up, sir, your proud airs, your many wishes, mannersims and extravagant claims.\nThey wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do you any good, sir!\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all I have to tell you.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œConfucius went off and said to his students: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I know that birds can fly and fish can swim and beasts can run. Snares can be set for things that run, nets for those that swim and arrows for whatever flies. But dragons! I shall never know how they ride the wind and cloud up into the sky. Today I saw Lao Tzu. What a dragon!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLao Tzu practiced the Way and its Virtue. He learned to do his work in self-effacement and anonymity. For a long time he lived in Chou, and when he saw that it was breaking up, he left. At the frontier, the official Yin Hsi said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Since, sir, you are retiring, I urge you to write me a book.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo Lao Tzu wrote a book in two parts, explaining the Way and its Virtue in something over five thousand words.\nThen he went away.\nNo one knows where he died.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTranslatory Notes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nTAO: A road, a path, the way by which people travel, the way of nature and finally the Way of ultimate reality.\n\nTE: Virtue, character, influence, moral force. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œoutward effect of a man and the inward effect of the self.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe final comment by the translator before launching into the ancient chapters of text is the following:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe message of the book is still of general interest,\nand that is important in a day when the old compartmentalisation of the world is so shaken by the idea of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“One WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\nIn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“One WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the Tao Te Ching would be quite at home.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cb25f26995844c56155c772f02df544afbf0a3a","amp;dn":"TAO+TE+CHING+-+The+Mystic+Wisdom+Of+Ancient+China+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cb25f26995844c56155c772f02df544afbf0a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,178,95,38,153,88,68,197,97,85,199,114,240,45,245,68,175,191,10,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
