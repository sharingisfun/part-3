Bugg \n  \n# Institute of Physics Publishing (IoP), Bristol and Philadelphia,\n# Second Edition (info: First edition - 1991)\n# 326 pages\n\n\nElectronics: Circuits,  Amplifiers and Gates, Second  Edition offers a\ncomplete introduction to the fundamentals  of AC and DC circuits along\nwith  complex  numbers,  bandwidth,  and  operational  amplifiers.  It\nincludes  a  description of  the  working  principles of  transistors,\noutlining doping and  the operation of the  diode, bipolar transistor,\nand  field effect  transistor.\n\n\nThe book also  features a section on digital logic  and concludes with\nmore advanced  chapters describing resonance and  transients and their\nrelation through Fourier analysis.\n\n\nUpdated  to  reflect advances  in  the  field  over the  past  decade,\nElectronics: Circuits,  Amplifiers and Gates, Second  Edition is fully\nillustrated  throughout  with  numerous  worked  examples  and  sample\nproblems.\n\n\n\nTable of Contents: (TOC)\n=================\n\n   1.
