Mixing baroque pop with elements of classic rock and British folk, the band took shape in 2006 as Pecknold was joined by guitarist Skyler Skjelset, bassist Bryn Lumsden, drummer Nicholas Peterson, and keyboardist Casey Wescott. After playing only a handful of shows, the band generated a healthy amount of label interest and caught the attention of local producer Phil Ek, who had previously helmed records by Built to Spill and the Shins. Ek worked with the band on its Sun Giant EP, which was issued by Sub Pop Records in spring 2008. Fleet Foxes' self-titled debut full-length followed that summer, earning them a healthy amount of critical respect in America as well as healthy sales in the U.K., where the band's debut went platinum. Helplessness Blues followed in 2011, marking the group's third collaboration with Phil Ek.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b479f6719e224c1e899e66deaaed2d81da7cf50","amp;dn":"Fleet+Foxes+-+Discography+%282008-2011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b479f6719e224c1e899e66deaaed2d81da7cf50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,71,159,103,25,226,36,193,232,153,230,109,234,174,210,216,29,167,207,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
