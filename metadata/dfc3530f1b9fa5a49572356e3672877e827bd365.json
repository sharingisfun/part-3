We are talking about earlier politically taboo (first of all - for us and for the residents of Eastern Europe), suppression of the individual subject totalitarian regimes. When French director Costa - Gavras , having Greek and Russian -Jewish roots, spoke of the military dictatorship in Greece (&quot; Zeta &quot;) , Uruguay (&quot; State of Siege &quot;) and Chile (&quot; Missing &quot;), we enthusiastically support him . And in the film &quot; Recognition&quot; director turned to Arthur's autobiographical notes of London , a member of the Czechoslovak government and one of the defendants in the famous &quot; process Slansky &quot; in 1951 , similar to those indicative of the tribunal, which were built in the USSR in the late 30's and in the end 40s .\nIt can be assumed that a particular anger at the ideological zealots of innocence of the Soviet people has caused Costa Gavras desire to expand the scope of the narrative and include a chronicle of the events of August 1968, when Soviet tanks entered Prague , issued ostensibly for the troops of the Warsaw Pact . Immediately director was accused of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism , and the name of his paintings ruthlessly edit out even filmograficheskih of reference publications. Only in the late '80s began soul-searching , reviewing many decades dominant ideological dogmas. The rapid democratic renewal in Eastern Europe also forced to change attitudes and to a series of past events. So many years ago, shot the film appeared extremely relevant ( as evidenced by his belated premiere in June 1990 in Moscow).\nCosta - Gavras succeeded in &quot; Confession &quot; is not only to tell the complex , tragic period in the history of Stalinist Czechoslovakia. It is stunningly recreated the mechanism of the dictatorship of authority , turning even an outstanding personality in the &quot; cog&quot; in the state machine, a voluntary &quot; lamb &quot; who has devoted himself to the slaughter . Jesuitry dictatorship manifested in the way it makes people communicate , including - in ourselves, to give the &quot; confession &quot;, the ideals of the party and the people , performing party discipline . Totalitarianism does not rest solely on the suppression or on the &quot; cult of personality&quot; of the leader - he largely owes its vitality to a certain &quot; herd instinct &quot;, the individual will be like everyone else , not to stand out from the crowd, even one that dutifully forwarded to the place of execution .\nThe director of this film leaves no illusions about the fallacies of historical errors, &quot;deviations&quot; from the party 's own off course . The main conflict is a duel to the death of a person and that forces (but only &quot; on their own &quot;) to deviate from the personal &quot;I&quot;, dissolve with pleasure and without a trace in the political mayhem inhuman terror , play another role - the repentant &quot;scapegoat&quot; - in a grand spectacle quite sacred character. Unquestioning faith in the party and the subordination of common interest - that , according to Costa - Gavras , has broken in communist jails those who passed the king , the bourgeois and the Gestapo prison. It was only a sense of human dignity, self-respect , is not subject to the process of &quot;mass brainwashing &quot; can survive and even break , after all , free.\nStrict in his manner , devoid of external stresses deployment events , focusing on the fate of one man , the picture of &quot;Recognition &quot; involves a deep inner drama , the work of thought. Originality and persuasiveness of cinematographic art manifested in the fact that the most authentic reproduction of the era, the documentary material does not interfere , but rather contribute to the metaphorical interpretation of the narrated stories . A French actor and singer Yves Montand , parted with leftist ideals even after the events in Budapest in December 1956 , played one of his best and dramatically different from the other part , by reason of which he was promptly removed from the number of &quot; best friends of the USSR .&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc3530f1b9fa5a49572356e3672877e827bd365","amp;dn":"%E5%A4%A7%E5%86%A4%E7%8D%84%2FL%27aveu%2FThe+Confession%281970%29Costa-Gavras%2C504x288","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc3530f1b9fa5a49572356e3672877e827bd365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,195,83,15,27,159,165,164,149,114,53,110,54,114,135,126,130,123,211,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
