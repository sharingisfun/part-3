With the emphasis on speed and the subject matter steeped in horror and gore, RIGOR stood out as extreme intimidators, on and off stage. Starting out as a 3 piece composed of Mike Scaccia on guitar, Harden Harrison on drums, and Casey Orr on bass, the band added vocalist Bruce Corbitt in '86 and quickly signed to Capitol Records, releasing their classic self titled debut record in '87. Two years later, Corbitt left the band and Doyle Bright came in on vocals. RIGOR went on to release two more records; &quot;Freaks&quot;, on Metal Blade Records and &quot;RIGOR MORTIS Vs. The Earth&quot;, on Triple X.\n\nIn 1991 Mike accepted an offer to join Ministry as well as Revolting Cocks, and Lard. And Rigor Mortis was no more, but the four members remained close friends and supported each others' endeavors.\n\nCasey Orr joined shock rockers, GWAR, where he's remained off and on since '94, and has performed or recorded with a list of other bands including Blohole (with Scaccia), The Hellions, The Burden Brothers, and XCOPS.\n\nHarden Harrison went on to play drums with Pervis, Speedealer, and Mitra.\n\nBruce has been enjoying recent success with his Thrash outfit, Warbeast, who released their debut record on Phil Anselmo's Housecore Records in late 2010.\n\nThe return of RIGOR MORTIS has been a long time coming. Though the band has reunited for a handful of shows over the last several years, schedules and personal lives just wouldn't allow for the time and commitment necessary for the band to properly reemerge with new material and a determination to take RIGOR to the next level.\n\nThe time is now.\n\nRIGOR MORTIS is set to go in the studio and to record their first new tracks in 20 years! The band will be in the studio from March 6th through the 8th with long time friend and producer Kerry Crafton (Vs. The Earth), recording 2 brand new songs. Talks with labels will follow and a new full length RIGOR MORTIS record will be released before the end of the year.Thats right the release date will be determined by The Pirate Bay user analogkid6103 and that date is.....Saturday October 4th 2014.\n\n\nimage\nReview:\n\n\nQuote:\nSometimes life plays strange and ironic games and this is not just a fancy saying but an undeniable fact. You see, RIGOR MORTIS returned and raised the expectations with the awesome performance in GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœKeep It TrueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ festival of 2009 but life had different plans. In a tragic coincidence, guitarist Mike Scaccia left this world while onstage performing with the band... So, fast forward two years and we see the band ready to release the comeback and at the same time last album ever, entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slaves To The GraveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. I have no idea how difficult or how painful was it for these guys to pull this through but what I do know is that the album is amazing! Thrash in its best form and allow me to tell you why.\n\nUsually there is a short intro in albums to get the listener in the right mood but with Ã¢â‚¬Å“PoltergeistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ things are way different because the lightning fast riff and the snare-action that follows will grab you by the neck and throw you in the middle of the hottest and most violent mosh-pit. Yeah, the tempo is fast and perfect for such Ã¢â‚¬ËœactivitiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and one should not forget Bruce CorbittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhorror/goreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ movies-like reading that puts the icing on this Thrash-to-the-bone album opener. But wait, this is not all since the guitar solo is simply amazing and fits perfectly in the mix before returning back to the steady snare-drumming and then... the song slows down with really cool clean guitar arpeggios and another guitar solo that brings along tons of melancholy as it changes 180 degrees the atmosphere. This is not the typical retro-Thrash composition and clearly there was a lot of inspiration involved in the making of this song and consequently of this album. Every song stands on its own and really there is no weak moment in the tracklist of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slaves To The GraveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nStill, there are some songs that quickly stand on top of the rest for different reasons. First on this list is the pounding Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flesh For FliesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that is a classic RIGOR MORTIS tune; from the gore-y lyrics, the killer drum-sound and the yet-again sharp riffs that will sound the charge for more moshing like there is no tomorrow. In the same flesh-rotting vein is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fragrance Of CorpseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where the lyrics reminded me of an old-school splatter movie Ã¢â‚¬Å“PiecesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and if you add the trademark rest of-the-band-backing vocals and the killer bass fills then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have all the ingredients for a massive 80s Thrasher. I mean, can you get more RIGOR MORTIS trademark than these lines: Ã¢â‚¬Å“modern day Frankenstein creating his friendsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? I am sure the answer is a mighty Ã¢â‚¬ËœnoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ so you have been warned (by the way, the chorus is equally great, hehe). Strangely enough the star of the standing-out-songs list is the longest song RIGOR MORTIS have ever written.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ludus MagnusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an epic piece that in fact starts with the four minutes long guitar-lead instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sacramentum GladiatorumÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that builds the perfect atmosphere before throwing you into Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ludus MagnusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The lyrics talk about the training school for gladiators who were to be slaughtered (but fight before doing so) in the arenas in Rome, so there is some flesh-ripping connection with the RIGOR MORTIS aesthetics. The song has a mid-tempo with marching like drums and speaking-like singing from Bruce who is into the role of a chief trainer having on the spotlight an amazing riff collection, and I am sure you will join singing the chorus with a clenched fist in the air. Be prepared for a long and even more epic guitar solo that ends the album on the highest of notes, so hitting Ã¢â‚¬ËœreplayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the only way to go.\n\nYeah, this album presentation leaves me a bitter-sweet taste in my mouth; on one hand this marks the end of RIGOR MORTIS and on the other is the best album ever created under this moniker. In any case, this is a must-purchase album and while doing so, keep in mind that the band is directly selling it, so you know where your money goes (I am sorry but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like having intermediates when supporting a band I love). LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrate the end of an era with an album that is already on my best-of-the-year album list.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Poltergeist\n02. Rain of Ruin\n03. Flesh for Flies\n04. The Infected\n05.
