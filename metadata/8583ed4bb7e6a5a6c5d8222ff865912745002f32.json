In less than a year after its formation, Kalmah was signed by Spinefarm Records, a Finnish record label. &quot;Kalmah&quot; is Karelian and could be translated as &quot;to the grave&quot; or &quot;to the death&quot;. The band is often termed &quot;Swamp Metal&quot; after their album cover themes.\nKalmah began in 1991 when Pekka Kokko and Petri Sankala founded the band Ancestor which originally played thrash metal, speed metal and death metal. After Ancestor had recorded two demos, Antti Kokko joined the band as lead guitarist. In 1998, after having recorded five demos and going through five different bassists whose names are unknown, Ancestor disbanded, and was refounded as Kalmah. The new band consisted of Pekka Kokko (vocals, guitar), Antti Kokko (lead guitar), Pasi Hiltula (keyboards), Altti VetelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤inen (bass), and Petri Sankala (drums) and converted to melodic death metal, but still incorporating their original styles.\nThe word &quot;Kalmah&quot; in Karelian means &quot;to the grave&quot; or &quot;to the death&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8583ed4bb7e6a5a6c5d8222ff865912745002f32","amp;dn":"Kalmah+-+Discography+%281999-2008%29+%5Bmp3%40128-320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8583ed4bb7e6a5a6c5d8222ff865912745002f32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,131,237,75,183,230,165,166,197,216,34,47,248,101,145,39,69,0,47,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
