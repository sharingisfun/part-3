The series was broadcast concurrently on BBC One in the United Kingdom, BBC America in the United States, and on Space in Canada, and also on ABC in Australia, with the first five episodes each released a week after its UK and North American premiere and the remainder released the day after each episode's UK premiere. Following its premiere on 1 September 2012, the series aired weekly until 29 September 2012. Six episodes were broadcast in 2012, including the 2012 Christmas special, &quot;The Snowmen&quot;, which aired separately from the main series. The remaining eight episodes began broadcasting on 30 March 2013. &quot;The Snowmen&quot; introduced a new TARDIS interior, title sequence, theme tune, and outfit for the Doctor.\n\nNOTE: As usual, since the episode 'The Snowmen' was televised in 2011, it has been included in my torrent for season 6.\n\nDoctor Who's seventh series was the show's third and final series to feature Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill. They reprized their roles of the Eleventh Doctor, Amy Pond and Rory Williams, from the previous series. Gillan and Darvill departed the series in the fifth episode, after which a new companion named Clara Oswald joined the Doctor, played by Jenna Coleman, remaining with the series for its second half. Smith stayed for one year longer than Gillan and Darvill, and departed after the 2013 specials, with his final appearance being in the 2013 Christmas special &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;.\n\n\nEpisode Synopses courtesy of:\n\nThe On-line TV Database\nAn Open Database for Television Fans &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2012-09-01 - Asylum of the Daleks (Video:H264 1280x720, 2919kbps, 25fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 192kbps)\n\nKidnapped by his oldest foe, the Doctor is forced on an impossible mission - to a place even the Daleks are too terrified to enter... the Asylum.
