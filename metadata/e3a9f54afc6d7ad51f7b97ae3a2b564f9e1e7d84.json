One of the most significant \n\ncultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as &quot;the \n\nKing of Rock and Roll&quot;, or simply, &quot;the King&quot;.\n\n  Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley and his family moved to Memphis, \n\nTennessee when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in \n\n1954, when he started to work with Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun \n\nRecords. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, \n\nPresley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-\n\ndriven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor \n\nacquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who was \n\nto manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA \n\nsingle, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, released in January 1956, was a number-one \n\nhit in the US. He became the leading figure of rock and roll after a \n\nseries of network television appearances and chart-topping records. His \n\nenergized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance \n\nstyle, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color \n\nlines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made \n\nhim enormously popularÃ¢â‚¬â€and controversial.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a9f54afc6d7ad51f7b97ae3a2b564f9e1e7d84","amp;dn":"+Elvis+Presley+-+4+CD+Box+Set+-+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a9f54afc6d7ad51f7b97ae3a2b564f9e1e7d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,169,245,74,252,109,122,213,31,123,151,174,58,43,86,79,158,30,125,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
