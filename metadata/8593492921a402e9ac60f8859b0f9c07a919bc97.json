He is widely known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Grapes of Wrath (1939) and East of Eden (1952) and the novella Of Mice and Men (1937). He was an author of twenty-seven books, including sixteen novels, six non-fiction books and five collections of short stories; Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962.\n\nThe day after Steinbeck's death in New York City, reviewer Charles Poore wrote in the New York Times: &quot;John Steinbeck's first great book was his last great book. But Good Lord, what a book that was and is: The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; Poore noted a &quot;preachiness&quot; in Steinbeck's work, &quot;as if half his literary inheritance came from the best of Mark TwainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the other half from the worst of Cotton Mather.&quot; But he asserted that &quot;Steinbeck didn't need the Nobel PrizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Nobel judges needed him.&quot;\n\nMany of Steinbeck's works are on required reading lists in American high schools. In the United Kingdom, Of Mice and Men is one of the key texts used by the examining body AQA for its English Literature GCSE. A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that Of Mice and Men was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools.\n\nAt the same time, The Grapes of Wrath has been banned by school boards: In August 1939, Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries. It was burned in Salinas on two different occasions. In 2003, a school board in Mississippi banned it on the grounds of profanity. According to the American Library Association Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, with Of Mice and Men ranking sixth out of 100 such books in the United States.\n\n- Bombs Away\n- Cannery Row\n- Cup of Gold\n- East of Eden\n- In Dubious Battle\n- Of Mice and Men\n- Sweet Thursday\n- The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights\n- The Grapes of Wrath\n- The Log from the Sea of Cortez\n- The Pearl\n- The Red Pony\n- The Short Novels of John Steinbeck\n- Travels with Charley in Search of America\n\nPlease keep the seed going!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8593492921a402e9ac60f8859b0f9c07a919bc97","amp;dn":"The+John+Steinbeck+Collection+++%28epub+retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8593492921a402e9ac60f8859b0f9c07a919bc97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,147,73,41,33,164,2,233,172,96,248,133,155,15,156,7,169,25,188,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
