In this fully updated collection, he reveals the secrets and illusions of modern imperialism. Beginning with Indonesia, he shows how General SuhartoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bloody seizure of power in the 1960s was part of a western design to impose a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœglobal economyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on Asia. A million Indonesians dies as the price for being the World BankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmodel pupilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. In a shocking chapter on Iraq, he allows us to understand the true nature of the WestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war against the people of that country. And he dissects, piece by piece, the propaganda of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwar on terrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to expose its Orwellian truth. Finally, he looks behind the picture postcard of his homeland, Australia, to illuminate an enduring legacy of imperialism, the subjugation of the First Australians.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nJohn Pilger is a distinguished Australian journalist based in London.\nHe has twice won Britain's Journalist of the Year Award and his documentaries have gained awards in Britain and worldwide.\nHe has also received several honorary doctorates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e39c257ff38d821ba92e38d0fbf0411329e05a5","amp;dn":"The+New+Rulers+of+the+World+-+John+Pilger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e39c257ff38d821ba92e38d0fbf0411329e05a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,57,194,87,255,56,216,33,186,146,227,141,15,191,4,17,50,158,5,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
