R. James, was an English mediaeval scholar and provost of King's College, Cambridge (1905ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1918) and of Eton College (1918ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1936). He is best remembered for his ghost stories which are widely regarded as among the finest in English literature. One of James's most important achievements was to redefine the ghost story for the new century by dispensing with many of the formal Gothic trappings of his predecessors, and replacing them with more realistic contemporary settings. At the same time, James's protagonists and plots tendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½like himselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to be absorbed with antiquarianism. As such, he is known as the originator of the &quot;antiquarian ghost story&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive tales by the master of the macabre, M R JamesRead by Benjamin Whitrow.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/ghost_stories__by_m_r_james_.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/ghost_stories__by_m_r_james_.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost Stories By M.
