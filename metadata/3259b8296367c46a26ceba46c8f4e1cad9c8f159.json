It was released on February 23, 1999, under Interscope Records and Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself. The majority of the record's lyrical content is written from the perspective of the rapper's alter ego Slim Shady, whom the rapper created on Slim Shady EP (1997). The lyrics are noted for their over-the-top depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity.\n\nTrack listing[edit]\nNo.\tTitle\tWriter(s)\tProducer(s)\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Public Service Announcement&quot; (skit)\tMathers, Jeff Bass\t \t0:33\n2.\t&quot;My Name Is&quot;  \tMathers, Young, Siffre\tDr. Dre\t4:28\n3.\t&quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; (featuring Dr. Dre)\tMathers, Young\tDr. Dre, Eminem\t3:19\n4.\t&quot;Brain Damage&quot;  \tMathers, J.
