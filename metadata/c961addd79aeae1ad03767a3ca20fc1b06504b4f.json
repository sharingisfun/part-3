It was released on October 7, 2003 through Equal Vision Records. It was recorded at Applehead Recording, Woodstock, New York and produced by Michael Birnbaum and Chris Bittner.\n\nThe album is the third installment (but second album released) of a predicted tetralogy about the ongoing saga of the Keywork in The Amory Wars. The Amory Wars is also the name of the graphic novel series written by lead singer Claudio Sanchez that details the events foretold in greater detail. There are two notable singles on this album: &quot;A Favor House Atlantic&quot; and &quot;Blood Red Summer&quot;.\n\nThe album peaked at #52 on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 500,000 copies and is RIAA certified Gold. Entertainment Weekly described it has being one of the top five key albums in the New prog genre.
