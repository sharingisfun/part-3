Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“neural balletÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that connects us brain to brain with those around us.\n\nOur reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitaminsÃ¢â‚¬â€and bad relationships like poisons. We can Ã¢â‚¬Å“catchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the Ã¢â‚¬Å“dark sideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for Ã¢â‚¬Å“mindsight,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.\n\nIs there a way to raise our children to be happy? What is the basis of a nourishing marriage? How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach? How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace? \n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - September 26th 2006\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72ad9a4d42b88d5c0032204acbcedf5230a8374","amp;dn":"Social+Intelligence+by+Daniel+Goleman+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72ad9a4d42b88d5c0032204acbcedf5230a8374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,42,217,164,212,43,136,213,192,3,34,4,172,188,237,245,35,10,131,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
