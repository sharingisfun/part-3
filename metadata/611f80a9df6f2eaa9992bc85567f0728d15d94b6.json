Itâ€™s a better decision because right off the bat, the group sound assertive and in control of their surroundings. Even the slight stumble early in Frame By Frame canâ€™t unseat this ferocious beast of a rendition - no wonder Belew can be heard exclaiming â€œAlright!â€ off mic at its conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe gigs came at a time when many commentators would ask what Trey Gunn was playing, as often his contributions couldnâ€™t be heard or discerned. Well, take a listen to One Time where his tender lines waft across the music from the very beginning, surreptitiously weaving in and out of the track to subtle but gorgeous effect. \r\nAfter attacking Red with gusto (and a dropped octave on the lead line), Frippâ€™s radiophonics interlude, and a racing Bâ€™Boom, once again itâ€™s Gunn who acts as principal colourist on this clatteringly energetic version of Thrak. Ditto the smouldering limbering-up of Talking Drum later in the evening.\r\n\r\nAfter dialing down the energy with a languid Matte Kudasai, and gathering their collective breath with SSEDD, the explosive funk opening of People draws shouts of approval from Fripp as the band revs up the pace to stomp this sucker flat. A second performance of Dinosaur in the encore section of the show has more vim and vigour than the one from earlier in the set. This might be the second date on the tour but its the first one where King Crimson really take to the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n01 - VROOOM\r\n02 - Coda: Marine 475\r\n03 - Frame By Frame\r\n04 - Dinosaur\r\n05 - One Time\r\n06 - Red\r\n07 - B'Boom\r\n08 - THRAK\r\n09 - Matte Kudasai\r\n10 - Sex, Sleep, Eat, Drink, Dream\r\n11 - People\r\n12 - VROOOM VROOOM\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n01 - Indiscipline\r\n02 - Improv Two Sticks\r\n03 - Elephant Talk\r\n04 - Prism\r\n05 - The Talking Drum\r\n06 - Larks' Tongues In Aspic Pt II\r\n07 - Dinosaur\r\n08 - Walking On Air\r\n\r\nÂ© 1995, 2010 Discipline Global Mobile / King Crimson \r\n  {DGM 16/44 Official Digital Download} (dgmlive.com) \r\n\r\nAudio Source: Dat Soundboard\r\nDGM Audio Quality Rating: 5 stars\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nAdrian Belew - Guitar, Voice, Words\r\nBill Bruford - Acoustic and Electronic Percussions\r\nRobert Fripp - Guitar\r\nTrey Gunn - Touch Guitar, Voice\r\nTony Levin - Basses, Chapman Stick, Voice\r\nPat Mastelotto - Acoustic and Electronic Percussions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:611f80a9df6f2eaa9992bc85567f0728d15d94b6","amp;dn":"King+Crimson+-+Teatro+Smeraldo%2C+Milan%2C+Italy+-+May+02%2C+1995+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"611f80a9df6f2eaa9992bc85567f0728d15d94b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,31,128,169,223,111,46,170,153,146,188,133,86,127,7,40,209,93,148,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
