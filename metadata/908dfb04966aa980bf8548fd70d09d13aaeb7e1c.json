He is the primary songwriter and lead singer of the band Matchbox Twenty and formerly of the band Tabitha's Secret. Thomas also records and performs as a solo artist. Thomas earned three Grammy awards for co-writing and singing on the Carlos Santana triple-platinum hit &quot;Smooth&quot; on the album Supernatural in 1999.\n\nHe has also lent his songwriting talents to such artists as Willie Nelson, Mick Jagger, Marc Anthony, Pat Green, Taylor Hicks, Travis Tritt and Daughtry.\n\nSince 1996, his band has released a string of hit singles to radio including &quot;Push&quot;, &quot;3 A.M.&quot;, &quot;Real World&quot;, &quot;Back 2 Good&quot;, &quot;Bent&quot;, &quot;If You're Gone&quot;, &quot;Mad Season&quot;, &quot;Disease&quot;, &quot;Unwell&quot;, &quot;Bright Lights&quot;, and &quot;How Far We've Come&quot;. In 2004, the Songwriters Hall of Fame awarded Thomas its first Starlight Award, recognizing young songwriters who have already had a lasting influence in the music industry.\n\nOn September 15, 2008, Thomas told Billboard.com that he's &quot;probably about 80 percent done&quot; with his second solo record, tentatively titled &quot;Cradle Songs&quot; at the time. Thomas characterized the album as &quot;the usual mish-mosh of styles, but hopefully just holding true to a bunch of good songs.&quot; with the article also mentioning that the record will nonetheless feature several tracks that &quot;take a more global, rhythmic direction after working with South American and African percussionists.&quot; Thomas explained one such experiment:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \tWe started off with the idea of doing a newer version of (Paul Simon's) The Rhythm of the Saints, and that kinda carried us a long way through. It gave us a whole new bed to work with, like 'How do I get my pop sensibility around this and work it into that?' It was a lot of fun. But you go through different phases when you're writing; it took a different turn, and I just followed it, too.\nIt's now completed\n\n1. \t&quot;Her Diamonds&quot;   \t4:39\n2. \t&quot;Gasoline&quot;   \t3:56\n3. \t&quot;Give Me the Meltdown&quot; (Rob Thomas, Matt Serletic) \t3:13\n4. \t&quot;Someday&quot; (Rob Thomas, Matt Serletic, Shy Carter) \t4:08\n5. \t&quot;Mockingbird&quot;   \t4:00\n6. \t&quot;Real World '09&quot; (Rob Thomas, Matt Serletic, Nellee Hooper) \t2:46\n7. \t&quot;Fire On the Mountain&quot;   \t5:09\n8. \t&quot;Hard On You&quot;   \t2:43\n9. \t&quot;Still Ain't Over You&quot;   \t3:09\n10. \t&quot;Natural&quot; (Rob Thomas, Matt Serletic) \t4:48\n11. \t&quot;Snowblind&quot;   \t3:54\n12. \t&quot;Wonderful&quot;   \t3:28\n13. \t&quot;Cradlesong&quot;   \t4:13\n14. \t&quot;Getting Late&quot;  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:908dfb04966aa980bf8548fd70d09d13aaeb7e1c","amp;dn":"Rob+Thomas+-+Cradlesong+%5BCD+2009%5D+%5BCov%2BCD%5D+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"908dfb04966aa980bf8548fd70d09d13aaeb7e1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,141,251,4,150,106,169,128,191,133,72,253,112,208,157,19,170,235,126,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
