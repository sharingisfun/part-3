Now three of her most popular books are collected in this single volume:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In Angel Therapy, Doreen delivers the angelic realmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s messages of comfort and guidance that can help you with troubling emotions such as depression, boredom, confusion, and anger; and issues associated with careers, relationships, parenting, and much more. Allow the angelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ words to heal your thoughts and beliefs, transforming them into empowering and loving viewpoints.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In Healing with the Angels, Doreen teaches esoteric and practical methods that can help you work more closely with your angels. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll read transcripts of DoreenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s angel-reading sessions and learn what the angels have to say about life after death, the future of our planet, and finding your Divine purpose. Also included is an exploration of the fascinating world of elementals and nature angels, as well as powerful angel affirmations and prayers for healing and manifesting.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Archangels &amp; Ascended Masters is a thoroughly researched book in a lively encyclopedia format, listing 77 divinities from Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Asian, Babylonian, Tibetan, Buddhist, Celtic, Theosophical, New Age, Catholic, Cabalistic, Jewish, and Christian roots. Doreen carefully studied and wrote about the history of each of the deities, what role they serve today, how they can help us with specific life problems, and how to call upon each one. \n\nThe Essential Doreen Virtue Collection is the perfect read for anyone who is looking to learn more about the angels and spirituality, as well as for those who want to finally have their favorite Doreen books together in one handy volume!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1037b4ec7e09734fcf82bf149c7dab860f311000","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Doreen+Virtue+Collection+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1037b4ec7e09734fcf82bf149c7dab860f311000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,55,180,236,126,9,115,79,207,130,191,20,156,125,171,134,15,49,16,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
