In \n\naddition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the book's album cover, the proper \n\ntrack number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper title and chapter information.  \nThis makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, \n\ngo back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go \n\nthrough the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the \n\nworld.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n=========================================================================================\n\nThere is a story that is usually told about extremely successful people, a story that \n\nfocuses on intelligence and ambition. Gladwell argues that the true story of success is \n\nvery different, and that if we want to understand how some people thrive, we should spend \n\nmore time looking around them-at such things as their family, their birthplace, or even \n\ntheir birth date. And in revealing that hidden logic, Gladwell presents a fascinating and \n\nprovocative blueprint for making the most of human potential.\n\nIn The Tipping Point Gladwell changed the way we understand the world. In Blink he \n\nchanged the way we think about thinking. In OUTLIERS he transforms the way we understand \n\nsuccess. \n\n=========================================================================================\n\nAUDIO FILES:\n\n01 - Introduction\n   01 - The Roseto Mystery.mp3\n\n02 - Part One - Opportunity\n   02 - Ch01 - The Matthew Effect.mp3\n   03 - Ch02 - The 10,000 Hour Rule.mp3\n   04 - Ch03 - The Trouble With Geniuses, Part 1.mp3\n   05 - Ch04 - The Trouble With Geniuses, Part 2.mp3\n   06 - Ch05 - The Three Lessons of Joe Flom.mp3\n\n03 - Part Two - Legacy\n   07 - Ch06 - Harlan, Kentucky.mp3\n   08 - Ch07 - The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes.mp3\n   09 - Ch08 - Rice Paddies and Math Tests.mp3\n   10 - Ch09 - Marita's Bargain.mp3\n\n04 - Epilogue\n   11 - A Jamaican Story.mp3\n   12 - An Interview With Malcolm Gladwell.mp3\n\n=========================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2943ba9caa6e65249c2e9017222e78e09542a703","amp;dn":"Outliers+-+Malcolm+Gladwell+%28organized+audio+%2B+ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2943ba9caa6e65249c2e9017222e78e09542a703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,67,186,156,170,110,101,36,156,46,144,23,34,46,120,224,149,66,167,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
