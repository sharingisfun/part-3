Along the way, the group racked up a string of gold and platinum albums in the U.S., along with a number of radio hits like &quot;Listen to the Music,&quot; &quot;Black Water,&quot; and &quot;China Grove.&quot;\n\nThe roots of the Doobie Brothers lie in Pud, a short-lived California country-rock band in the vein of Moby Grape featuring guitarist/vocalist Tom Johnston and drummer John Hartman. After Pud collapsed in 1969, the pair began jamming with bassist Dave Shogren and guitarist Patrick Simmons. Eventually, the quartet decided to form a group, naming themselves the Doobie Brothers after a slang term for marijuana. Soon, the Doobies earned a strong following throughout Southern California, especially among Hell's Angels, and they were signed to Warner Bros. in 1970. The band's eponymous debut was ignored upon its 1971 release. Following its release, Shogren was replaced by Tiran Porter and the group added a second drummer, Michael Hossack, for 1972's Toulouse Street. Driven by the singles &quot;Listen to the Music&quot; and &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright,&quot; Toulouse Street became the group's breakthrough. The Captain and Me (1973) was even more successful, spawning the Top Ten hit &quot;Long Train Runnin'&quot; and &quot;China Grove.&quot; \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Listen To The Music\n02.Jesus Is Just Alright\n03.Rockin' Down The Highway\n04.Long Train Runnin'\n05.Without You\n06.China Grove\n07.Nobody\n08.Black Water\n09.Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me)\n10.It Keeps You Runnin'\n11.Takin' It To The Streets\n12.You Belong To Me\n13.Echoes Of Love\n14.What A Fool Believes\n15.Minute By Minute\n16.Dependin' On You\n17.One Step Closer\n18.Real Love\n19.The Doctor\n20.Dangerous\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05230e304118088cf3481ec6f244501ebd75cee2","amp;dn":"The+Doobie+Brothers+-+Greatest+Hits+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05230e304118088cf3481ec6f244501ebd75cee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,35,14,48,65,24,8,140,243,72,30,198,242,68,80,30,189,117,206,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
