Originally, the group was called Hollycaust, but they changed their name to Frankie Goes to Hollywood -- taken from an old headline about Frank Sinatra's acting career -- by the end of the year. The band didn't make anything of note until 1982, when they appeared on the British television program The Tube with a rough version of the video for &quot;Relax.&quot; The appearance attracted attention from several record labels as well as record producer Trevor Horn. Horn contacted the band and signed them to his label, ZTT. Late in 1983, Frankie's first single, the Horn-produced &quot;Relax&quot;/&quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey,&quot; was released. A driving dance number, &quot;Relax&quot; featured sexually suggestive lyrics that would soon lead to great controversy.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Relax\n02.Two Tribes\n03.War\n04.Ferry Cross The Mersey\n05.Warriors Of The Wasteland\n06.For Heaven's Sake\n07.The World Is My Oyster\n08.Welcome To The Pleasuredome\n09.Watching The Wildlife\n10.Born To Run\n11.Rage Hard\n12.The Power Of Love\n13.Bang\n14.Relax (New York Mix - The Original 12&quot;)\n15.Two Tribes (Featuring Adamski)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c84cc4b3623c17f334e878592e5280b10f7a5764","amp;dn":"Frankie+Goes+To+Hollywood+-+Greatest+Hits+%281994%29+%5BCDRip%5D+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c84cc4b3623c17f334e878592e5280b10f7a5764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,76,196,179,98,60,23,243,52,232,120,89,46,82,128,177,15,122,87,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
