Forstchen now brings us a story which can be all too terrifyingly real...a story in which one man struggles to save his family and his small North Carolina town after America loses a war, in one second, a war that will send America back to the Dark Ages...A war based upon a weapon, an Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP).  A weapon that may already be in the hands of our enemies.\n \nMonths before publication, One Second After has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second. It is a weapon that the Wall Street Journal warns could shatter America. In the tradition of On the Beach, Fail Safe and Testament, this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future...and our end.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c28df674821ddd4bf47f337923791d28ee1ff9","amp;dn":"One+Second+After++by+William+R+Fortschen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c28df674821ddd4bf47f337923791d28ee1ff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,194,141,246,116,130,29,221,75,244,127,51,121,35,121,29,40,238,31,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
