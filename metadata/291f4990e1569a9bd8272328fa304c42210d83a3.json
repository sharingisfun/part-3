Legendary Scandinavian director Victor SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶strÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m stars as Isak Borg, an aging medical professor who reassesses his life while journeying to his former university to receive an honorary degree. Borg travels with his estranged daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin) and revisits many of the landmarks of his past, conjuring up memories of his family and of his onetime sweetheart Sara (Bibi Andersson). Returning to the present, he meets a teenage girl who resembles the long-departed Sara. She hitches a ride with the professor and Marianne, as do a ceaselessly bickering married couple. These new characters eventually become intertwined with Borg's hazy flashbacks and fantasies, as the old man recalls the disappointments and disillusionments that have left him cold and guilt-ridden, attributes emphasized when he encounters his equally cold and resentful son. Bookending Borg's odyssey of self-discovery are a series of symbolic images at the beginning of the film (a clock without hands, a man without a face) and a hauntingly beautiful finale, in which professor is beckoned back to the &quot;perfect&quot; world he left behind so many years earlier. This classic art movie remains one of Bergman's most accessible films and one of the most influential European art movies of its generation. Its intense focus on one man's thoughts, regrets, and memories set the tone for innumerable psychological character studies in its wake.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Smultronstallet.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 721 Kbps\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate : 1 522 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 432 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.255\n      Stream size : 988 MiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.0 (UTC 2005-11-22)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Video delay : 20ms\n      Stream size : 125 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 96 ms (2.30 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 96 ms\n\nSwedish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nIMDB: tt0050986","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:291f4990e1569a9bd8272328fa304c42210d83a3","amp;dn":"Wild+Strawberrries+%28Bergman%2C+1957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"291f4990e1569a9bd8272328fa304c42210d83a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,31,73,144,225,86,154,155,216,39,35,40,250,48,76,66,33,13,131,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
