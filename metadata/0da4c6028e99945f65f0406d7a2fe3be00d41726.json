On Pickin' Up the Pieces, Fitz &amp; the Tantrums showcased a '60s soul and R&amp;B approach that mixed sample beats with old-school horns and keyboards, much in the same way Amy Winehouse did on her breakthrough 2006 album, Back to Black. Rather than revisit that sound, Fitz &amp; the Tantrums have clearly decided to update the approach, and More Than Just a Dream finds the band delving into a variety of electronic dance sounds that touch upon '80s new wave, disco, and blue-eyed soul. Still centered around the shared lead vocals of Michael Fitzpatrick and Noelle Scaggs, Fitz &amp; the Tantrums worked with Beck and M83 producer Tony Hoffer, who added guitars, synths, and other programmed beats to the mix. To these ends, tracks like &quot;Out of My League,&quot; &quot;6am,&quot; and &quot;Spark&quot; are immediately catchy tunes that showcase Hoffer's slick, radio-ready production. Of course, the band hasn't completely abandoned its retro roots, and cuts like the piano-driven &quot;Keepin Our Eyes Out&quot; and the psych-soul-influenced &quot;House on Fire&quot; definitely bring to mind a mix of '60s Brill Building and Motown sounds. Ultimately, with More Than Just a Dream, Fitz &amp; the Tantrums have made an even more infectious, club-ready album than Pickin' Up the Pieces, while still retaining all of the band's organic soulfulness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0da4c6028e99945f65f0406d7a2fe3be00d41726","amp;dn":"Fitz+and+the+Tantrums+-+More+Than+Just+a+Dream+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0da4c6028e99945f65f0406d7a2fe3be00d41726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,164,198,2,142,153,148,95,101,240,64,109,122,47,227,190,0,212,23,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
