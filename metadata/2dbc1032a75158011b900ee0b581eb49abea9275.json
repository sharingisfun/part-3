Filmed at the Union Square Theatre in New York City, Glover invites the audience into his life, sharing everything from childhood tales about his unrequited love for Cocoa Puffs and trips to Home Depot, to observations on Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgetting famousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, relationships, the N word and why kids are awful people. Smart and hip with a fresh approach to comedy, Glover presents a solid hour of his hilariously original, wisecracking humor.\n\nGener: Comedy\nIMDB rating: -/10\nDirected by: Michelle Caputo\nStarring: Donald Glover\n\nRelease Name: Donald.Glover.Weirdo.2011.DVDRip.XviD-iGNiTiON\nSize: 1CD\nVideo: XviD | 624 x 352 | 1.266 kbps\nAudio: English | AC3 | 224 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 5m\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dbc1032a75158011b900ee0b581eb49abea9275","amp;dn":"Donald.Glover.Weirdo.2011.DVDRip.XviD-iGNiTiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dbc1032a75158011b900ee0b581eb49abea9275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,188,16,50,167,81,88,1,27,144,14,224,181,129,235,73,171,234,146,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
