This is the\nfirst (and only) film to truly shed light on a movement that has heretofore\nbeen shrouded in darkness and rumor and obscured by inaccurate and shallow\ndepictions. Featuring exclusive interviews and verit with the musicians, \na wealth of rare, seldom seen footage from the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Inner Circle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;s earliest \ndays, Until the Light Takes Us explores every aspect of the controversial \nmovement that has captured the attention of the world. This is the movie \nthat gets inside the minds and hearts of black metal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s musicians. The \nfilmmakers moved to Norway, living and filming there for two years. The \nmovie is not about them though - it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s about the extraordinary people and \nevents that make black metal unique, unforgettable, and inevitable. This \nis black metal as seen through the eyes of those who created it, of those \nwho live it, of those who are at the center of the story of black metal.[/b]\n\n[img]http://www.musicalwarfare.com/theme/images/untilflyer.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Featured interviewees:[/b]\n\nGylve \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Fenriz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Nagell (Musician, Darkthrone, Isengard, Storm )\nVarg \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Count Grishnackh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Vikernes (Musician, Burzum, Mayhem)\nJan Axel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHellhammerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Blomberg (Musician, Mayhem)\nOlve \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Abbath\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Eikemo (Musician, Immortal)\nHarald \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Demonaz\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦vdal (Musician, Immortal)\nBjarne Melgaard (Visual artist)\nKristoffer \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Garm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Rygg (Musician, Ulver, Arcturus)\nKjetil \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Frost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Haraldstad (Musician, Satyricon, Gorgoroth, 1349, Keep of Kalessin)\nBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Faust\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Eithun (Emperor) - Eithun chose to appear with his voice distorted and in a silhouette.\n\n\nDirected by Aaron Aites &amp; Audrey Ewell\nProduced by Audrey Ewell &amp; Aaron Aites\nDistributed by Variance Films\nRelease date(s) December 4, 2009\nRunning time 93 minutes\nCountry United States\nLanguage English\n\n\nVideo: 640x336 @ 884 Kbps\nFPS: 29.976 fps\nAudio:  MP3 160 kbps Stereo\nRuntime: 93 mins\nXvid Build: XviD 1.2\nPacked Bitstream: No\nB-frames: 2 \nSize: CD1 = 37 x 20mb = 698mb \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bca21117b66ad4f043f8a84ef16f9b5cc7805aae","amp;dn":"UNTIL+THE+LIGHT+TAKES+US%282009%29+DVDRip+%5BDocumentary+on+BLACK+META","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bca21117b66ad4f043f8a84ef16f9b5cc7805aae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,162,17,23,182,106,212,240,67,248,168,78,241,111,155,92,199,128,90,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
