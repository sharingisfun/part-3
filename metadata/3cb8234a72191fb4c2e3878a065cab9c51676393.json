It is their first album since 2008's Nostradamus and also their first without founding guitarist K. K. Downing, who retired from the band in 2011 and was replaced by new guitarist Richie Faulkner.\n\nThe album sold around 32,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 6 on The Billboard 200 chart, the band's highest charting position in the US after the group's previous album, &quot;Nostradamus&quot;, debuted at No. 11. This marks the band's first top 10 album debut in the US. That was only cause of the extra promotion we gave to this great Judas Priest album.\nGuitarist Glenn Tipton said that fans should not expect wild experimentation. &quot;Sometimes in the past we may have come under fire for being too adventurous musically Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so we have listened,&quot; he said. &quot;From start to finish, 'Redeemer of Souls' is 18 songs of pure classic Priest metal.&quot;\n\nWhen asked why the bonus tracks are only included on the deluxe edition of the album and not on the standard release, Tipton explains:\n\n    &quot;They are all great songs,&quot; he says. &quot;The reason they are not on the album is because the 13 that we chose are very consistent with what we wanted to do, which was release an undisputable heavy metal album. The others, they are not lightweight by any chance, but they've got a different feel, a different texture [...] so it's not a case of trying to rip the kids off and trying to get more money for an extra album, it's just a case of, these five tracks seem to deserve to go on their own CD, and that's what we did.&quot;\n\nThe five bonus tracks from the deluxe edition were released as a stand-alone limited-edition 10&quot; vinyl LP, titled 5 Souls, for Record Store Day 2014.\nAnd the 3rd CD was from the Australian Live shows Live Redeemer-10 Souls. It was a rather spur of the moment thing that just was not ready for Record Store Day 2015.\n\nRegarding whether technology has changed the band's songwriting process at all, Halford said: &quot;It's dangerous to walk around with a flash drive on a bunch of keys. [Laughs] To a great extent, it doesn't really change. The technology is amazing in terms of the advantages it brings to music now, some of it good, some of it very bad. It's all about discipline and self-belief, determination, wanting to do the best you can do and not accepting anything that's below par. We've always had that attitude in Priest. We've always felt really strongly about any track that goes out for our fans. We're still doing it If we know anything its how to step up and put it down. \nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Glenn Tipton, Rob Halford and Richie \n\nFaulkner. \n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n\n\n1. \t&quot;Dragonaught&quot;   \t4:26\n2. \t&quot;Redeemer of Souls&quot;   \t3:58\n3. \t&quot;Halls of Valhalla&quot;   \t6:04\n4. \t&quot;Sword of Damocles&quot;   \t4:54\n5. \t&quot;March of the Damned&quot;   \t3:55\n6. \t&quot;Down in Flames&quot;   \t3:56\n7. \t&quot;Hell &amp; Back&quot;   \t4:46\n8. \t&quot;Cold Blooded&quot;   \t5:25\n9. \t&quot;Metalizer&quot;   \t       4:37\n10. \t&quot;Crossfire&quot;   \t       3:51\n11. \t&quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot;   \t5:41\n12. \t&quot;Battle Cry&quot;   \t           5:18\n13. \t&quot;Beginning of the End&quot;   \t5:07\n\nTotal length:\n\t61:58 \t\nDeluxe edition bonus disc/5 Souls EP \t\n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n\n1. \t&quot;Snakebite&quot;   \t        3:14\n2. \t&quot;Tears of Blood&quot;   \t4:19\n3. \t&quot;Creatures&quot;   \t     4:25\n4. \t&quot;Bring It On&quot;   \t3:18\n5. \t&quot;Never Forget&quot;   \t6:25\nTotal length:\n\t83:39 \t\nSuper Deluxe edition bonus disc/Live Redeemer-10 Souls\n\nNo.      Title   Length \n1.       &quot;Battle Cry&quot;                       .57\n2.       &quot;Dragonaut&quot;                      4:10 \n3.       &quot;Metal Gods&quot;                      4:43\n4.       &quot;Devils Child&quot;                   5:30\n5.       &quot;Halls Of Valhalla&quot;              6:15\n6.       &quot;March Of The Damned&quot;            3:59\n7.       &quot;Turbo Lover&quot;                    6:03\n8.       &quot;Redeemer Of Souls&quot;               5:50\n9.       &quot;Beyond The Realms Of Death&quot;          7:34\n10.      &quot;Breaking The Law&quot;                3:02\nTotal length:\n       131:44\t\n\nPersonnel\n\nJudas Priest\n\n    Rob Halford Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Glenn Tipton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, synthesizer\n    Ian Hill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Scott Travis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Richie Faulkner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n\nProduction\n\n    Produced and mixed by Mike Exeter and Glenn Tipton","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cb8234a72191fb4c2e3878a065cab9c51676393","amp;dn":"Judas+Priest+-+Redeemer+Of+Souls+%28Super+Deluxe+Edit+3-CD%29+2015+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cb8234a72191fb4c2e3878a065cab9c51676393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,184,35,74,114,25,31,180,194,227,135,138,6,92,171,156,81,103,99,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
