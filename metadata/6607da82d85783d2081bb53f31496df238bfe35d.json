In Quirkology, he navigates the oddities of human behavior, explaining the tell-tale signs that give away a liar, the secret science behind speed-dating and personal ads, and what a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sense of humor reveals about the innermost workings of his or her mindÃ¢â‚¬â€all along paying tribute to others who have carried out similarly weird and wonderful work. WisemanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research has involved secretly observing people as they go about their daily business, conducting unusual experiments in art exhibitions and music concerts, and even staging fake seances in allegedly haunted buildings. With thousands of research subjects from all over the world, including enamored couples, unwitting pedestrians, and guileless dinner guests, Wiseman presents a fun, clever, and unexpected picture of the human mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6607da82d85783d2081bb53f31496df238bfe35d","amp;dn":"+Quirkology%3A+How+We+Discover+the+Big+Truths+in+Small+Things","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6607da82d85783d2081bb53f31496df238bfe35d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,7,218,130,216,87,131,210,8,27,181,63,49,73,109,242,56,191,227,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
