Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resistÃ¢â‚¬â€œbooks. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau.\n\nThis is an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40a15b1274aff3707e1c32d98bb5e274614c50d5","amp;dn":"The+Book+Thief","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40a15b1274aff3707e1c32d98bb5e274614c50d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,161,91,18,116,175,243,112,126,28,50,217,139,181,226,116,97,76,80,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
