When a body finally emerges on the lake and suspects literally crawl out of the hills, the two lawmen realize theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re being toyed with and to make things worse, the killer seems to have set his eyes on a group of sorority girls who are not only isolated by the lake, but have their own nefarious plans in mind.
