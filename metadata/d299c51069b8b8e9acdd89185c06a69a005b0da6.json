He was a lifelong committed Marxist who developed the theory and practice of his &quot;epic theatre&quot; to explore the theatre as a forum for political ideas and the creation of a critical aesthetics of dialectical materialism.  In 1949 he and his wife established the Berliner Ensemble, perhaps the most famous German touring theatre of the postwar era, primarily devoted to performing Brecht's plays.\n\nFew areas of modern theatrical culture have not felt the impact or influence of Brecht's ideas and practices.  His theories and techniques have also exerted considerable sway over certain strands of film theory and cinematic practice.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format (&quot;Mother Courage&quot; is also in ePUB), all of them improved versions of older scans in which the page images have been completely reprocessed with contents in bookmarks and accurate pagination.\n\n* BRECHT ON THEATRE: The Development of an Aesthetic (Methuen, 1974).
