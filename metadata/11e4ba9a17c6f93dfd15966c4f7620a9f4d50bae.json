It is a reflection of the age old temptation of Man, the story of Goethe's Faust. Karl Maria Brandauer is magnificent as Hendrik HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶fgen, the obsessed &quot;actor&quot; who will do anything to gain wealth and fame. He first betrays the world around him, and then his inner values are swept away as he finally enters the inner sanctum of Nazi Germany. Is true theatre on stage or in the handshake that HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶fgen makes in the prime minister's box behind the audience? Everything in this movie revolves around HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶fgen's downward spiral into the abyss; the initial ascent to stardom was but an illusion. Mann instinctively knew that tragedy would befall his country when a pact was made between Hitler and the financial, industrial and military ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lites of Germany - remember the book was written nine years before that country's downfall. View the movie and read the book. Two truly artistic achievements! Thumbs up to IstvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n SzabÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ and K.M. Brandauer who managed to reveal everything in HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶fgen's character.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Mephisto.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,868,378,112 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:24:04\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 688x384 (AR: 1.792)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1527 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.241 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082736/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082736/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGerman audio; English subpack\n\nIstvan Szabo - Mephisto (1981)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11e4ba9a17c6f93dfd15966c4f7620a9f4d50bae","amp;dn":"Istvan+Szabo+-+Mephisto+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11e4ba9a17c6f93dfd15966c4f7620a9f4d50bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,228,186,154,23,198,249,61,253,21,150,108,79,118,32,169,244,213,11,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
