So, this Third Edition for 2011 is virtually a ground-up overhaul, with six new chapters and a stem-to-stern refreshing of every other topic I covered the last time around. There are now full chapters on Travel shooting, People/Portrait Photography (with lighting diagrams), Photographing Concerts and Performances, Scenic, Wildlife, and Nature Photography, Action Photography, and Macro work.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3ed721bf844544bbe87e1d28cd68f7b031ac47b","amp;dn":"Mastering+Digital+SLR+Photography+-+The+Serious+Photographers+Gu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3ed721bf844544bbe87e1d28cd68f7b031ac47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,237,114,27,248,68,84,75,190,135,225,210,140,214,143,123,3,26,196,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
