Raid Mode, which was first introduced  to  the  series  in  the\noriginal version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online  in\nco-op mode or alone in single player  taking  on  the  hordes  of  enemies\nacross a variety of missions whilst leveling  up  characters  and  earning\nweapon  upgrades.  New  weapons,  skill  sets,  and  playable   characters\nincluding  Hunk,  take  the  Raid   Mode   experience   to   new   depths.\n \nThe critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back  to  the\nevents that took place between  Resident  Evil  4  and  Resident  Evil  5,\nrevealing the truth about the T-Abyss  virus.  Resident  Evil  Revelations\nfeatures series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris  Redfield,  plus  their\nrespective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. The action\nbegins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the  'Queen  Zenobia',\nwhere horrors lurk around  every  corner,  before  players  head  for  the\nmainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia.  With  limited  ammo  and\nweapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of  Resident  Evil\nRevelations.\n \n \nFeatures:\n\n* Enhanced visual and aural fidelity - Resident Evil Revelations brings\n  spine-chilling fear complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced\n  lighting effects and an immersive sound experience.\n* Classic survival horror gameplay returns - the campaign mode's single\n  player experience sees gamers investigating a range of different\n  locations including the dark confined spaces of a cruise ship and the\n  treacherous snow covered mountains. With limited ammo and weapons, fight\n  off infected enemies that lurk around every corner.\n* Hell just got hotter - Infernal Mode, a new difficulty mode for the\n  re-mastered HD edition, is not just more challenging than Easy and\n  Normal modes but also remixes enemy and item placement, so even those\n  familiar with the game will discover new terrors.\n* Meet the Wall Blister - A brand new enemy, the Wall Blister is a mutated\n  creature borne from the T-Abyss virus that spreads through water, adding\n  to the horrors that lurk around every corner.\n* Residentevil.net support - Resident Evil Revelations will take full\n  advantage of Residentevil.net with content available to users once the\n  game launches.
