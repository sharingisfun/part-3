As you build momentum for Primal eating, you'll find that you won't even miss the bland, boring, low-fat foods that previously were the central focus of your diet. How can you argue with a menu that includes Roasted Leg of Lamb with Herbs and Garlic, Salmon Chowder with Coconut Milk, Tomatoes Stuffed with Ground Bison and Eggs, and Baked Chocolate Custard?\n\nThis isnt a crash course diet. These and the other Primal recipes provide the foundation for a lifetime of delicious, healthy eating, high energy and protection from common health problems that arise from eating the SAD (Standard American Diet).\n\nAuthor(s): Mark Sisson,Jennifer Meier\nTitle: The Primal Blueprint Cookbook: Primal, Low Carb, Paleo, Grain-Free, Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free (Primal        Blueprint Series\nPublisher: Primal Nutrition\nYear: 2010\nISBN: 0982207727\nFormat: EPUB - PDF\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
