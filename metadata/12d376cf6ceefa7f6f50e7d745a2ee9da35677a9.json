With the release of Server 2012, the time is right to learn Hyper-V!\n\nA word from the instructor, virtualization expert David Davis:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Calling All Windows Admins!\n\nWindows Server 2012 is here, and I can tell you from my experience that Microsoft has done a great job with this new release. There are so many new features, but the one IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m most excited about (being a virtualization guy) is the latest version of Hyper-V. Microsoft has gotten virtualization right with Hyper-V 3.0.\n\nPerhaps youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been waiting to get into virtualization because you heard that previous editions of Hyper-V just werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that good. Maybe you considered vSphere, but felt the cost was too high. Or, maybe you just havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t had the time to learn about virtualization.\n\nFriends, the time is now!\n\nHyper-V is powerful, feature-rich, easier to use, and 100% included with every copy of Windows Server.\n\nTo get started learning the new Hyper-V 3.0 in Windows Server 2012, all you need is my new video training course. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve created this course to be ideal for Windows Admins who want to learn how to:\n\nInstall Windows 2012 Hyper-V\nManage Hyper-V and create new virtual machines\nCreate new virtual networks\nUse virtual storage, virtual disks, and snapshots\nUse Client Hyper-V in Windows 8\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait any longer to learn MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful virtualization technology that can make your datacenter more efficient, agile and scalable while making your life as a Windows Admin easier than ever before!\nGood Luck!
