In addition to photographs of rocks in the field, there are numerous line diagrams and examples of metamorphic features shown in thin section. The thin section photos are all at a scale and in a context that can be related to views seen in the field through a hand lens.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1.rgstatic.net/i/profile/50463542d4a0038ca9_l_e4a31.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1.rgstatic.net/i/profile/50463542d4a0038ca9_l_e4a31.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nKurt T Hollocher is Professor of Geology at Union College\nB.S. 1978 Antioch College; M.S. 1981, Ph.D. 1985 Geology, University of Massachusetts at Amherst\nArea of Specialization: Petrology, Geochemistry\nWorks on rocks in the deeply, eroded cores of mountain belts to see what the igneous and metamorphic rocks there can tell us about the tectonic development of the original mountains. Also works on the chemistry of natural surface and ground waters to understand how they formed and to track contaminants, and on dinosaur fossils to better understand the fossilization processes.\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface ix\nAbout the author xi\nAcknowledgements xiii\nA matter of scale xv\n1 Introduction 1\nPart 1: Metamorphic rock types 19\n2 Pelitic rocks 19\n3 Quartzites 29\n4 Marbles 39\n5 Calc-silicate rocks 49\n6 Mixed sedimentary rocks 59\n7 Conglomerates and breccias 67\n8 Gneisses 77\n9 Basaltic rocks, low and intermediate pressure 89\n10 Blueschists 101\n11 Eclogites 107\n12 Ultramafic rocks 117\n13 Contact metamorphic rocks 127\n14 Rocks in fault zones 135\nPart 2: Metamorphic features 147\n15 Foliation, cleavage, lineation 147\n16 Folds 161\n17 Porphyroblasts, porphyroclasts, and augen 175\n18 Boudins 187\n19 Veins and hydrothermal alteration 197\n20 Metasomatism 209\n21 Partial melting and migmatites 221\n22 Retrograde metamorphism 235\nPart 3: Relict pre-metamorphic features 245\n23 Relict sedimentary features 245\n24 Fossils in metamorphic rocks 255\n25 Relict igneous features 261\nReferences 277\nGlossary of terms, rock types, and minerals 281\nGlossary of terms 281\nGlossary of rock types 292\nGlossary of minerals 295\nIndex 303\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s22.postimg.org/y98gwibg1/A_Pictorial_Guide_to_Metamorphic_Rocks_in_the_Fi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s22.postimg.org/y98gwibg1/A_Pictorial_Guide_to_Metamorphic_Rocks_in_the_Fi.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de258a209856632f2525c382ae955d334999f917","amp;dn":"A+Pictorial+Guide+to+Metamorphic+Rocks+in+the+Field+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de258a209856632f2525c382ae955d334999f917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,37,138,32,152,86,99,47,37,37,195,130,174,149,93,51,73,153,249,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
