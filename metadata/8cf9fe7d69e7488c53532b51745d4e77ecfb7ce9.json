With important implications.\n\nThink of the last time you went to the zoo... \n\nHave you ever wondered why you never see a monkey, orangutan or other primate fumbling around, bumping into trees, or tripping over logs? It never happens.\n\n(And don't tell me it's because they had LASIK surgery!) ;-)\tMonkey with Glasses\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The real reason is this: Poor vision isn't a natural problem. It doesn't occur in nature.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nSo what does cause it then? We'll get to that, and it'll probably surprise you (hint: it's not what you've been told). But once you discover the truth, you'll also get the pleasant surprise of enjoying the following life-changing benefits:\n\n\tEnjoy 20/20 vision without having to rely on glasses or contacts\n\tNo more forgetting your glasses or contacts\n\tStop buying contacts all the time\n\tNo more dry or itchy eyes from contacts\n\tFeel and look younger\n\tDrive more safely, reduce risk\n\tBe more independent\n\tNever have to wear glasses again\n\tFully enjoy nature and beauty\n\tNo more sunlight sensitivity\n\tBreak free of eye drops\n\tStay safer in an emergency\n\tNever break glasses again\n\tImpress your eye doc and friends\n\tSee as nature intended\n\tNo more eye straining\n\tSee the world more clearly\n\tSee your kids (or grandkids) better\n\tSteer clear of risky and potentially harmful LASIK surgery\n\tSave money on eye care\n\nNow that you know what's possible...let me show you how you can start experiencing some of these benefits for yourself, and start enjoying your life more.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“To fix your eyesight, you need to understand what's ruining it to begin withÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOver 100 years ago, a well-known MD by the name of Dr. William Bates studied the true causes of vision problems, and what he figured out was revolutionary. \n\nIt turns out that our eyes are designed to see, but not in the ways we use them today.\n\nThe real problem is the strain that modern life puts on our eyes. Neither people nor animals do this in nature (remember our primate friends from earlier). \n\nIf you've ever strained a muscle then you know exactly what I'm talking about...it simply fails to work properly once it's strained. And if you keep doing the activity that strained it to begin with, it'll continue to malfunction indefinitely. And you'll feel crippled. \n\nYet our technology driven world calls for constant straining as we read books, watch television, use a computer, drive, read signs, and participate in all sorts of activities and devices... \n\n...ones which simply are not found in nature. \n\n\n\n\nAre you starting to see why we humans are the only species on the planet that has to deal with seeing the world in a blurry, distorted way? \n\nEven that isn't fully accurate, because there's no such thing as a baby with poor vision...the condition is simply one we acquire. And we acquire it because we're not using our eyes as nature intended. \n\nDiscovering this was a major &quot;aha&quot; moment for me - as it may be for you. But nothing would prepare me for the &quot;knowledge bomb&quot; that dropped into my lap next...\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The answer was right before my eyes...literallyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nIt was hard enough to accept that I wasn't helping people by fitting them with glasses - or what Bates called &quot;eye crutches&quot;...\n\nBut when I came across the following quote in his book (verified later by modern medical journals and researchers), I was floored.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n \tÃ¢â‚¬Å“If glasses are worn continuously over time the poor vision will generally become worse. Essentially what glasses do is lock the eyes into their refractive state and in order to see through your lenses you have to maintain the poor vision that the lenses are designed to correct.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWm H Bates: Perfect Sight Without Glasses 1920      \n \t\n\t\n\n\nThis was a tough pill to swallow, as you can imagine. If it was true, I'd have to close the doors to my practice...I was supposed to be helping people see better, not worse, right?\n\nI immediately tried the following exercise (you can try it too)...\n\n\nI put on my glasses and did 2 hours worth of reading and writing. When I was done, I took them off, and looked back at the book I'd been rifling through...\n\nResult: I was only able to see about half as well as I had before I'd put my glasses on.\n\n\nThe bad news was I did close down my ophthalmology office. The good news is I finally started helping people really improve their vision, effectively, naturally, safely, affordably, and permanently.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The answer to restoring perfect vision - improving the Bates MethodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nAlong with his research findings on why we suffer from vision disorders, Dr. Bates also proposed a series of exercises to eliminate eyestrain and reverse degenerated vision.\n\nAlthough Dr. Bates' approach was the best thing out there at the time, there was still plenty of room for improvement. This is usually the case when a revolutionary new science comes along.\n\nNow that I had made it my mission to help people see the way nature intended, I spent years doing my own research. \n\nYears of painstaking trial and error...\n\nTalking with other experts in my field...\n\nAnd helping people (who volunteered to try the methods I was developing) cure their vision problems, naturally...\n\nI then combined all of this knowledge, all of my scientific discoveries, with my experience and training as an Optometrist...\n\nTo create an easy to follow program that helps you see a sharper, clearer world in as little as a few weeks' time.\n\n\nIntroducing...\n\nVision Without GlassesÃ¢â€žÂ¢\nThe simplest path to 20/20 vision, developed by a leading Optometrist\nVision Without GlassesÃ¢â€žÂ¢\n\nVision Without GlassesÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is perfect for anyone who...\n\n\tIs sick and tired of being\nchained to glasses or contacts\t\tDoesn't like the way they\nlook in glasses\n\tExperiences irritation from\ncontact lenses\t\tWants to see the world\nmore clearly\n\tDoesn't want to risk eye\nsurgery\t\tDoesn't want to spend a\nton of money on surgery\n\n\nSimply put, if you're someone who values being able to see the world around you in all of its bright, clear beauty-naturally - then Vision Without GlassesÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is the answer you've been looking for.\n\n\nWhat You Get When You Order\nVision Without GlassesÃ¢â€žÂ¢\n\n\tDitch your glasses, contacts and eye drops once and for all, and never think about them again.\n\tLearn a quick and easy action plan that literally forces your visual system into &quot;self correction&quot; mode and helps you regain perfect 20/20 vision.\n\tSee the people you love, watch movies &amp; TV, read books, and enjoy life with perfect clarity.\n\tFind out my simple 5-second trick that will help you deal with your eye doctor's negativity as he finds out you've improved your own vision without his help.\n\tNever worry about the &quot;what-ifs&quot; of losing your glasses or contacts again.\n\tDiscover the right way to use glasses and contacts so they won't interfere with your results as you progress through my program.\n\tFeel younger and more agile than you have in years.\n\tSteer clear of a deadly diagnostic mistake most doctors and optometrists make concerning the difference between strained and stressed eyesight...and how you can correct both right from the comfort of your own home.\n\tSave money on doctor visits and glasses or contacts expenses...for good.\n\tGet my 60-second remedy to stop headaches and eyestrain in their tracks, naturally, without drugs or chemicals.\n\tEnjoy the independence and confidence that come from achieving perfect vision on your own and surprising (and impressing) the hell out of your eye doctor, family and friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf9fe7d69e7488c53532b51745d4e77ecfb7ce9","amp;dn":"Vision+Without+Glasses+-+The+Bates+Method","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf9fe7d69e7488c53532b51745d4e77ecfb7ce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,249,254,125,105,231,72,140,83,83,43,81,116,93,78,119,236,251,124,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
