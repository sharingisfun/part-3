Among the avant-garde he was considered a spiritual and sexually liberated ambassador for tolerance and enlightenment.  With an energetic and loving personality, Ginsberg used poetry for both personal expression and in his fight for a more interesting and open society.\r\n\r\nGinsberg is best known for his first published book HOWL (1956), in which he lamented the destruction of &quot;the best minds of my generation&quot; and denounced the forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States.  It drew much criticism for its frank embrace of such taboo topics as homosexuality and drug use, and following its seizure by San Francisco police and US Customs, attracted widespread publicity when it became the subject of an obscenity trial.  KADDISH (1961), often considered Ginsberg's greatest work, is a long confessional poem about his mother's insanity and his desperate attempts to come to terms with both his relationship to her and with her death.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTED POEMS, 1947-1997 (2006) is the first comprehensive one-volume collection of Ginsberg's published poetry.  WAIT TILL I'M DEAD (2016) compiles uncollected verse that Ginsberg submitted to various publications and selected from his correspondence.\r\n\r\nSeveral volumes of Ginsberg's letters, journals, essays, and interviews are also included here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in ePUB and/or PDF format as indicated:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  == POETRY ==\r\n\r\n* Collected Poems, 1947-1997 (HarperCollins, 2006) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* Howl &amp; Other Poems (City Lights, 1959) -- PDF\r\n\r\n* Howl, Kaddish &amp; Other Poems (Penguin Classics, 2009) -- ePUB\r\n\r\n* Reality Sandwiches (City Lights, 1963) -- ePUB + PDF\r\n\r\n* Wait Till I'm Dead: Uncollected Poems (Grove, 2016).
