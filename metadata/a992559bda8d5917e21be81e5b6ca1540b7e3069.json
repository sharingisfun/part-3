Edward Snowden was a 29-year-old computer genius working for the National Security Agency when he shocked the world by exposing the near-universal mass surveillance programs of the United States government. His whistleblowing has shaken the leaders of nations worldwide, and generated a passionate public debate on the dangers of global monitoring and the threat to individual privacy.\n\nIn a tour de force of investigative journalism that reads like a spy novel, award-winning Guardian reporter Luke Harding tells SnowdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s astonishing storyÃ¢â‚¬â€from the day he left his glamorous girlfriend in Honolulu carrying a hard drive full of secrets, to the weeks of his secret-spilling in Hong Kong, to his battle for asylum and his exile in Moscow. For the first time, Harding brings together the many sources and strands of the storyÃ¢â‚¬â€touching on everything from concerns about domestic spying to the complicity of the tech sectorÃ¢â‚¬â€while also placing us in the room with Edward Snowden himself. The result is a gripping insider narrativeÃ¢â‚¬â€and a necessary and timely account of what is at stake for all of us in the new digital age.\n\nGenre: Biography, Memoirs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a992559bda8d5917e21be81e5b6ca1540b7e3069","amp;dn":"The+Snowden+Files+by+Luke+Harding","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a992559bda8d5917e21be81e5b6ca1540b7e3069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,146,85,155,218,141,89,23,226,27,232,30,91,108,161,84,11,126,48,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
