The book is divided into three fundamental groupings: one stand-alone chapter is devoted to Theory and Principles, nine chapters individually treat major transformer types, and fourteen chapters cover many ancillary topics associated with power transformers. Throughout the book, tables, charts, photographs, and equations describe the operation and performance of power transformers and facilitate the reader's understanding of the technical materia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5157f3b96f28756a6984cb8ad34884eb14371da4","amp;dn":"Electric+Power+Transformer+Engineering+by+James+H.+Harlow.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5157f3b96f28756a6984cb8ad34884eb14371da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,87,243,185,111,40,117,106,105,132,203,138,211,72,132,235,20,55,29,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
