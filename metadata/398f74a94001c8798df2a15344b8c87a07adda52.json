Each section is independent and self-contained and is preceded by a page of Section Objectives and Section Contents, besides highlighting outstanding contribution of an eminent Pathologist in that subspecialty to stimulate the interest of students in the history of Pathology. The basic style of presentation in the revised edition has been retained, i.e. exercise-based teaching as would happen in the routine weekly pathology practical class of undergraduate students. These exercises are further systematically organised based on organ systems and topics. Present edition of the book has 58 Exercises compared to 53 in the previous edition. Besides, there have been changes and insertions of newer slides in many exercises. These additions were considered essential keeping in view the contemporary concepts on learning of basic pathology of diseases. The material in each exercise has been thoroughly revised and updated laying emphasis on further clarity and accuracy of the text and images. The book lays emphasis on honing of practical skills in the students for laboratory techniques and on learning gross and microscopic pathology. Thus, the description of the topic/disease is largely on applied aspects while theoretical details have been kept out so as not to lose the main focus. All the illustrations in the revised edition of the book are new and are more numerous now; all these are now in colour. Previous black and white line sketches of gross pictures have been replaced with clicked photographs of representative museum specimens. Likewise, all the changed photomicrographs have new corresponding coloured and labeled line sketches across them. There are also many additional photos of instruments commonly used in a modern pathology laboratory. These major changes coupled with digital technology in photography have enhanced the readability and have given a pleasing look to the book. Another innovative feature of the revised edition is addition of a chapter on Clinico-pathologic Conferences (CPCs) and its corresponding CD containing ten structured CPCs. Since CPCs are included in the curriculum of undergraduate students, it was considered prudent to include ten CPCs pertaining to different organ systems in CD format with the book. Each of these ten CPCs on the CD is a corollary of a case and includes its clinical data, pathologic findings at autopsy including pictures of organs and corresponding microscopic findings, and is concluded with final autopsy diagnosis and cause of death in a particular case. In essence, the new edition provides a wholly revised material of text and illustrations, all in colour in a highly presentable and attractive format, along with bonus of CD on ten CPCs. The revised edition should meet not only the aspirations of undergraduate students of medicine and dentistry but also those pursuing alternate streams of medicine and paramedical courses.
