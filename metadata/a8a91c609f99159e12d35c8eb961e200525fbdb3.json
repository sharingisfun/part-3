The premium subscription comes with a 100% discount to any product from their store, and naturally I chose the most complete one:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.innovativelanguage.com/Learn-Japanese--Complete-Audio-Course-_p_403.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.innovativelanguage.com/Learn-Japanese--Complete-Audio-Course-_p_403.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis is a collection of 8 executable files, covering nine proficiency levels, from Beginner to Advanced, plus a bonus file with survival phrases:\n\nLevel 1 - Introduction\nLevel 2 - Absolute Beginner\nLevel 3 - Lower Beginner\nLevel 4 - Beginner\nLevel 5 - Upper Beginner\nLevel 6 - Lower Intermediate\nLevel 7 - Intermediate\nLevel 8 - Upper Intermediate\nLevel 9 - Advanced\nBonus   - Survival Phrases\n\nNote that their shop does offer each of these as individual products; this is merely a collection of those ten courses, and is not integrated in any way. They offer this &quot;complete&quot; download as a multipart-part zip archive comprised of seven 600MB files (rather than ten independent zip files) and I had some trouble uncompressing them (not many archive managers support multi-part files in the format z01, z02, etc.), so I though I'd make it a more convenient download as a torrent. You're welcome :)\n\n\nThis program requires .NET 4 (get it from www.microsoft.com/net)\n\n\n*** Features ***\n\n286 Complete language lessons from Beginner to Advanced.
