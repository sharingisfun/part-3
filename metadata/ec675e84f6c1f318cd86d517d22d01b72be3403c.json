These super-fights have a different set of rules from that of the international BJJ federation (IBJJF) as the time limit is of 20 minutes (regular black belt fights are usually 10 minutes long) and the fightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s winners are only determined by submission, meaning, if after 20 minutes of fighting there hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been a tapout, the fight will be declared a draw, regardless of any positional dominance that may occur throughout the fight.\n\nThis is a set of rules often used in the early days of jiu jitsu, when the original Gracie family members started the art, and it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come as a surprise that one of the eventÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promoters is a Gracie family member, Ralek Gracie. \n\n\nFight Card:\n\nEddie Bravo (10th Planet) vs. Royler Gracie (Gracie Humaita)\nRafael Mendes (Atos) vs. Clark Gracie (Carley Gracie Team)\nKeenan Cornelius (Atos) vs. K.
