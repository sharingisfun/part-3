The album was released under Shady Records, and spawned the hit single &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;. It also spawned a follow up soundtrack, More Music from 8 Mile, consisting of songs that appear in 8 Mile, that were released as singles during the film's time setting of 1995. One of the songs was performed by Tupac Shakur, who would be the subject of a documentary with a soundtrack produced by Eminem, who also produced a posthumous album by Tupac. The album also features four songs by the Wu-Tang Clan and its members, and two songs by Mobb Deep, who eventually signed to G-Unit Records, headed by Shady Records artist 50 Cent. Both albums were also made available in censored versions, removing most of the strong profanity and violent content.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1effb8c319ecbe45f9a924519bfc9c1fb2c58ffb","amp;dn":"Eminem+-+8+Mile+%28OST%29+-+Special+Edition+%5B+mp3%40320+%5D+-+CAPTAiN_24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1effb8c319ecbe45f9a924519bfc9c1fb2c58ffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,255,184,195,25,236,190,69,249,169,36,81,155,252,156,31,178,197,143,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
