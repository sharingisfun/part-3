An altered R-rated version was produced for the later DVD release, and until March 7th 2013, that's all that was available. The German label Concorde Home Entertainment, however, just released this uncut NC-17 version which is the original theatrical version.\n\nDetails about the differences between the alternate US version and the uncensored original cut can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=567941&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=567941&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8092ec2aba94ae6b0af8f2b4d54304a134b016bf","amp;dn":"The+Dreamers+%5BUncut+NC-17%5D+%282003%29+%5B720p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8092ec2aba94ae6b0af8f2b4d54304a134b016bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,146,236,42,186,148,174,107,10,248,242,180,213,67,4,161,52,176,22,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
