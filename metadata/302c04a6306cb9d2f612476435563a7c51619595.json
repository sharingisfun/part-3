Frontman Mike Score, a former hairdresser, is responsible for this Liverpool band's worst and best aspects, the latter being a talent for almost painfully catchy pop melodies and synth hooks that bounce along nicely over gradually descending bass lines. In addition to the aforementioned &quot;I Ran,&quot; this best-of sports two versions of the equally sublime &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)&quot; and a selection of tracks from AFOS's six-year career, including &quot;It's Not Me Talking.&quot;\n1. I Ran (So Far Away)\n2. Space Age Love Song\n3. Telecommunication\n4. More You Live, The More You Love\n5. Nightmares\n6. Wishing (If I Had a Photography of You)\n7. (It's Not Me) Talking\n8. Transfer Affection\n9. Who's That Girl (She's Got It)\n10. D.N.A.\n11. Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You) [Extended Version] - A Flock of Seagulls, A Flock of Seagulls\n12.
