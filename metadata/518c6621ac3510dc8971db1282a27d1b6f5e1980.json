Johnson's mythic deal with the Devil, in exchange for his extraordinary musical gifts, has become a fixture in blues lore and an example of the enduring pull of superstitions that can be traced back to Mother Africa and Yoruba deities. Producer-director Walter Hill (The Long Riders, Streets of Fire) sought to put this uniquely American mystery on film, but when he was unable to secure a script devoted directly to Johnson himself, Hill bravely decided to proceed with a more oblique, allegorical story that retold the Satanic bargain through a fictionalized drama set in the present day.\n\nIn this 1986 feature, the hero is Eugene, a classically trained guitar virtuoso pulled toward the earthier powers of blues. When he stumbles across a lost blues legend, Willie Brown (a real blues figure and Johnson peer known for his partnerships with Charley Patton and Son House, among others), Eugene begins an odyssey back to the delta country and the crossroads of the title, where both Willie and Johnson had traded their souls for blues power, to help the surviving bluesman renegotiate terms.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 897 MiB for 1h 38mn 50s 640ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : DVD5\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 076 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 352 (1.818) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 180 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:518c6621ac3510dc8971db1282a27d1b6f5e1980","amp;dn":"Crossroads-%281986%29+%5BDVDrip+%28XviD%29%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"518c6621ac3510dc8971db1282a27d1b6f5e1980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,140,102,33,172,53,16,220,137,113,219,18,130,162,125,27,111,94,25,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
