INCLUDES THEIR 3 NEWEST ALBUMS RELEASED LAST YEAR! This batch is only missing &quot;The Time Past And I Could Not See You Again.&quot; There aren't any repeats, however; I organize my music meticulously. Actually I lied, there ARE repeats: &quot;Haruka Kanata,&quot; &quot;After Dark,&quot; and &quot;Rewrite,&quot; themes from the anime Naruto, Bleach, and Fullmetal Alchemist. Again, due to the way I organize my music.\n\nAlbum covers are already assigned to the MP3s!\n\nFor album info, go here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Kung_Fu_Generation#Discography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daec02b98e9ed3091db112f55b6670b39beaa7e3","amp;dn":"Asian+Kung-Fu+Generation+Discography+%5B160+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daec02b98e9ed3091db112f55b6670b39beaa7e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,236,2,185,142,158,211,9,29,177,18,245,91,102,112,179,155,234,167,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
