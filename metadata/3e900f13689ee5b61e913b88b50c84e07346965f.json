Do not attempt to adjust the picture.\n\nresolution of this series is 560x416\n\nSimilar in style to The Twilight Zone with more science fiction than fantasy stories, The Outer Limits is an anthology of distinct story \n\nepisodes, sometimes with a plot twist at the end. Unlike the original incarnation of the series, which was a pure anthology with each \n\nepisode completely unrelated to the others, the revival series maintained an anthology format, but occasionally featured recurring story \n\nelements that were often tied together during season-finale clip shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e900f13689ee5b61e913b88b50c84e07346965f","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits+Season+7+%5B2001-2002%5D+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e900f13689ee5b61e913b88b50c84e07346965f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,144,15,19,104,158,229,182,30,145,59,136,181,12,132,224,115,70,150,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
