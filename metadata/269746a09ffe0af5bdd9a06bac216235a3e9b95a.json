Rhapsody, the main character, is a Namer, a profession that includes passing down the history and lore of the people and the land. As a Namer, Rhapsody, can only speak the truth. A Namer has incredible power because when they speak (or sing) they describe the very nature or essence of a person or a thing. In some instances a Namer can change the parameters of a person or a thing by giving it a new name. When Rhapsody meets up with her two future companions she accidentally uses her Naming power to rename The Brother, a ruthless assassin, to &quot;Achmed The Snake.&quot; This accident forces Rhapsody to join Achmed and his companion who are on the run from an ancient and dangerous foe, a F'Dor demon.\r\n\r\nRhapsody: Child of Blood (1999)\r\nProphecy: Child of Earth (2001)\r\nDestiny: Child of the Sky (2002\r\n)\r\nThe Bridge/Middle Duology:\r\n\r\nRhapsody, Achmed, Grunthor live out their new lives after the aftermath of the Cymrian Council.
