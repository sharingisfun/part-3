Criminals are flooding the U.S. with drugs thus earning loads of money from that business. Being fed up with that state of affairs, American government decides to get rid of drug bosses from Colombia. The war in Colombia breaks out... You are a soldier of U.S. Army Special Task Force. You have been dropped behind the enemy lines with one and only goal - to eliminate the boss of Colombian cartel.\n\n It was a routine operation.

The expedition dared to destroy cocaine fields belonging to the Benedictions cartel: the largest and most ruthless drug lord alliance in Colombia.\n\nFeatures:-\n\n* Fight night and day, rain or shine - The action doesn't stop!
