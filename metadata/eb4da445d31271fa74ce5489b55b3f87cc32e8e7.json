YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll   learn  how   to  combine  small,   yet  powerful,\ncommand-line tools to  quickly obtain, scrub, explore,  and model your\ndata.\n\nTo get  you started  - whether  youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on  Windows, OS  X, or  Linux -\nauthor  Jeroen  Janssens  introduces  the  Data  Science  Toolbox,  an\neasy-to-install virtual  environment packed with over  80 command-line\ntools.\n\nDiscover why  the command line  is an agile, scalable,  and extensible\ntechnology. Even  if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already comfortable  processing data with,\nsay, Python or R, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll greatly improve your data science workflow by\nalso leveraging the power of the command line.\n\n    - Obtain data from websites, APIs, databases, and spreadsheets\n    - Perform scrub operations on plain text, CSV, HTML/XML, and JSON\n    - Explore data, compute descriptive statistics, and create visualizations\n    - Manage your data science workflow using Drake\n    - Create reusable tools from one-liners and existing Python or R code\n    - Parallelize and distribute data-intensive pipelines using GNU Parallel\n    - Model data with dimensionality reduction, clustering, regression, and classification algorithms\n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nJeroen Janssens is a senior data  scientist at YPlan in New York City.\nHis specialties are  in machine learning, anomaly  detection, and data\nvisualization. Jeroen  is passionate about building  open source tools\nfor doing  data science. He obtained  a B.Sc. in Life  Sciences and an\nM.Sc.  in  Artificial Intelligence,  both  cum  laude from  Maastricht\nUniversity,  the Netherlands.  Jeroen completed  his Ph.D.  in Machine\nLearning  at  the  Tilburg  center for  Cognition  and  Communication,\nTilburg  University. Outside  of work,  you  may find  him biking  the\nBrooklyn Bridge, beatboxing, or eating stroopwafels.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb4da445d31271fa74ce5489b55b3f87cc32e8e7","amp;dn":"Data+Science+at+the+Command+Line+-++Jeroen+Janssens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb4da445d31271fa74ce5489b55b3f87cc32e8e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,77,164,69,211,18,113,250,116,206,84,137,181,91,63,135,204,50,232,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
