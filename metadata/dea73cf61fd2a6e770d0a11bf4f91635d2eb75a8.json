Thus the importance of the Bible for our spiritual formation cannot be overstated. If we are honest, though, the Bible is not always easy to understand. For example, the places named in the Bible can seem strange, and the number of people mentioned is virtually countless.\r\nThis comprehensive dictionary intends to help people read the Bible with increased understanding and confidence. It contains articles on major topics as well as places and people, even if they just appear in a single verse in the Bible. Its articles cover theological topics, biblical words, biblical imagery, and historical topics. This A to Z dictionary includes more than\r\n\r\nâ€¢ 1,700 full-color pages\r\nâ€¢ 400 color illustrations, maps, and photos\r\nâ€¢ 5,000 articles by leading evangelical scholars\r\n\r\nThe Baker Illustrated Bible Dictionary is an informative, colorful, and easy-to-understand resource that will be an indispensable reference for your own personal study or in preparation for teaching.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nTremper Longman III (PhD, Yale University) is the Robert H.
