ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something every artist wants to be, but few earn the distinction. Charlie WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name is on that short list.\n\nFrom his breakout as a member of the Gap Band (Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Dropped A Bomb On Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“OutstandingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s to his revered solo recordings (2005Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s certified gold Charlie, Last Name Wilson, 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Grammy nominated Uncle Charlie), Wilson has sold millions of albums, inspired a throng of artists who modeled their vocal stylings after his (most notably Aaron Hall and R. Kelly) and cemented his status as a musical icon with accolades from Billboard and BET, among a host of others.\n\nI have always loved the group the GAP BAND and always liked the lead singers voice: Charlie Wilson. Here for 2013 is Charlie Wilson's latest CD called Charlie Wilson, Love Charlie. Hope you all enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b0d1ba08d01390f7d168626416b13b3cc820ac4","amp;dn":"CHARLIE+WILSON%2C+LOVE+CHARLIE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b0d1ba08d01390f7d168626416b13b3cc820ac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,13,27,160,141,1,57,15,125,22,134,38,65,107,19,179,204,130,10,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
