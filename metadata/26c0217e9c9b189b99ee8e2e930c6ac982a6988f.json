By this point, Fela could do no wrong when it came to recording; Afro-beat dissenters will claim that there is a trance-inducing similarity to much of Fela's '70s recorded output, that the grooves aren't enough to make the songs distinctive enough on their own. That's true of some of his later recordings (like in the mid- to late '80s), but at this point he was still breathing fire and the band was in top form. Perhaps the distinguishing factors of records like Open &amp; Close and some of Fela's other '70s releases are that as much as he liked to ride a groove, he also liked to disrupt it, twist it and turn it, reshape it, only to bring it back to its original shape. There was less of that later in his career.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c0217e9c9b189b99ee8e2e930c6ac982a6988f","amp;dn":"Fela+Kuti+-+Open+%26amp%3B+Close+%281972%3B+1996%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c0217e9c9b189b99ee8e2e930c6ac982a6988f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,192,33,126,156,155,24,155,153,238,142,46,147,12,106,201,130,166,152,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
