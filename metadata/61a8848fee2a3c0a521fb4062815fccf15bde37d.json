But John Lee Hooker recorded in a great many more styles than that over a career that stretched across more than half a century.\n\n&quot;The Hook&quot; was a Mississippi native who became the top gent on the Detroit blues circuit in the years following World War II. The seeds for his eerily mournful guitar sound were planted by his stepfather, Will Moore, while Hooker was in his teens. Hooker had been singing spirituals before that, but the blues took hold and simply wouldn't let go. Overnight visitors left their mark on the youth, too: legends like Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton, and Blind Blake, who all knew Moore.\n\n\nCanned Heat --\n\nCertainly their hearts were in the right place. Canned Heat's debut album -- released shortly after their appearance at Monterey -- was every bit as deep into the roots of the blues as any other combo of the time mining similar turf, with the exception of the original Paul Butterfield band. Hite was nicknamed &quot;The Bear&quot; and stalked the stage in the time-honored tradition of Howlin' Wolf and other large-proportioned bluesmen. Wilson was an extraordinary harmonica player, with a fat tone and great vibrato. His work on guitar, especially in open tunings (he played on Son House's rediscovery recordings of the mid-'60s, incidentally) gave the band a depth and texture that most other rhythm players could only aspire to. Henry Vestine -- another dyed-in-the-wool record collector -- was the West Coast's answer to Michael Bloomfield and capable of fretboard fireworks at a moment's notice.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tBlues\nOriginal Date:\t\t1971\n\n\nWhen this two-LP set was initially released in January 1971, Canned Heat was back to its R&amp;B roots, sporting slightly revised personnel. In the spring of the previous year, Larry &quot;The Mole&quot; Taylor (bass) and Harvey Mandel (guitar) simultaneously accepted invitations to join John Mayall's concurrent incarnation of the Bluesbreakers. This marked the return of Henry &quot;Sunflower&quot; Vestine (guitar) and the incorporation of Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; de la Barreda (bass), a highly skilled constituent of Aldolfo de la Parra (drums). Sadly, it would also be the final effort to include co-founder Alan &quot;Blind Owl&quot; Wilson, who passed away in September 1970. Hooker 'n Heat (1971) is a low-key affair split between unaccompanied solo John Lee Hooker (guitar/vocals) tunes, collaborations between Hooker and Wilson (piano/guitar/harmonica), as well as five full-blown confabs between Hooker and Heat. The first platter focuses on Hooker's looser entries that vacillate from the relatively uninspired ramblings of &quot;Send Me Your Pillow&quot; and &quot;Drifter&quot; to the essential and guttural &quot;Feelin' Is Gone&quot; or spirited &quot;Bottle Up and Go.&quot; The latter being among those with Wilson on piano. Perhaps the best of the batch is the lengthy seven-minute-plus &quot;World Today,&quot; which is languid and poignant talking blues, with Hooker lamenting the concurrent state of affairs around the globe. &quot;I Got My Eyes on You&quot; is an unabashed derivative of Hooker's classic &quot;Dimples,&quot; with the title changed for what were most likely legal rather than artistic concerns. That said, the readings of the seminal &quot;Burning Hell&quot; and &quot;Bottle Up and Go&quot; kept their familiar monikers intact. The full-fledged collaborations shine as both parties unleash some of their finest respective work. While Canned Heat get top bill -- probably as it was the group's record company that sprung for Hooker 'n Heat -- make no mistake, as Hooker steers the combo with the same gritty and percussive guitar leads that have become his trademark. The epic &quot;Boogie Chillen No. 2&quot; stretches over 11-and-a-half minutes and is full of the same swagger as the original, with the support of Canned Heat igniting the verses and simmering on the subsequent instrumental breaks with all killer and no filler. The 2002 two-CD pressing by the French Magic Records label is augmented with &quot;It's All Right,&quot; with a single edit of &quot;Whiskey and Wimmen.&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Messin' With The Hook\n02.The Feelin' Is Gone\n03.Send Me Your Pillow\n04.Sittin' Here Thinkin'\n05.Meet Me In The Bottom\n06.Alimonia Blues\n07.Drifter\n08.You Talk Too Much\n09.Burning Hell\n10.Bottle Up And Go\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.The World Today\n02.I Got My Eyes on You\n03.Whiskey and Wimmen'\n04.Just You and Me\n05.Let's Make It (1970)\n06.Peavine\n07.Boogie Chillen No. 2\n08.It's All Right\n09.Whiskey and Wimmen' (Single Version)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a8848fee2a3c0a521fb4062815fccf15bde37d","amp;dn":"John+Lee+Hooker+%26+Canned+Heat+-+Hooker+%5C%27N+Heat+%282002%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a8848fee2a3c0a521fb4062815fccf15bde37d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,168,132,143,238,42,60,10,82,31,180,6,40,21,252,207,21,189,227,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
