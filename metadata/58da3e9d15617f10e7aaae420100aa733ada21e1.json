Seacord created this video for developers who have previous experience in C language programming. In six lessons, Professional C Programming, Part I shows developers how to perform common C language programming tasks correctly while avoiding programming errors that are not always detected or reported by the compiler.\n\n \nRobert C. Seacord leads the Secure Coding Initiative at CERT, located in Carnegie Mellon UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Software Engineering Institute (SEI) in Pittsburgh, PA. Seacord is an adjunct professor in both the School of Computer Science and the Information Networking Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.   He is also the author of The CERT C Secure Coding Standard and Secure Coding in C and C++ as well as other books on computer security, legacy system modernization, and component-based software engineering.\n \n\nTable of Contents:\n\nIntroduction\n\nLesson 1:  Integer Types\n   Learning objectives \n   Introduction to integer types\n   Unsigned integers\n   Signed integers\n   Character types\n   size_t, ptrdiff_t, intmax_t and uintmax_t\n   Summary\n\nLesson 2: Integer Conversions\n   Learning objectives \n   Conversion rank, promotions, and the usual arithmetic conversions\n   Conversions to unsigned types\n   Conversions to signed types\n   Summary\n\nLesson 3: Integer Operations\n   Learning objectives\n   Assignment\n   Addition and subtraction\n   Multiplication and upcasting\n   Division/remainder\n   Shifting\n   Summary\n\nLesson 4: Characters, Arrays, and Strings \n   Learning objectives \n   Sizing arrays\n   String literals and their use as array initializers\n   Character types and what they are used for\n   Summary\n\nLesson 5: String Handling\n   Learning objectives\n   Caller allocates, caller frees\n   Bounds-checking interfaces\n   Callee allocates, caller frees (POSIX)\n   Summary\n\nLesson 6: Optimization\n   Learning objectives\n   Undefined behaviors and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“as ifÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rule\n   Constant folding\n   Algebraic simplification and pointer arithmetic\n   Hoisting of loop-invariant computations\n   Dead-code removal\n   Aliasing\n\n   Summary\n\nSummary\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.informit.com/store/professional-c-programming-livelessons-video-training-9780133123357&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.informit.com/store/professional-c-programming-livelessons-video-training-9780133123357&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58da3e9d15617f10e7aaae420100aa733ada21e1","amp;dn":"Professional+C+Programming+LiveLessons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58da3e9d15617f10e7aaae420100aa733ada21e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,218,62,157,21,97,127,16,231,170,174,66,1,0,170,115,58,218,33,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
