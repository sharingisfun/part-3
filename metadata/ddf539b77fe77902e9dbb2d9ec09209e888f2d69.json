The detainees, rather than accept lengthy jail sentences for their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“crimesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, gamble their freedom on an attempt to reach an American flag ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ on foot and without water ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ through the searing heat of the desert. The pursuit of Group 637 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a lethal, one-sided game of cat-and-mouse with a squad of heavily armed police and National Guardsmen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is contrasted with the corrupt trial of Group 638 by a quasi-judicial tribunal.\nFrom: http://eurekavideo.co.uk/moc/catalogue/punishment-park/\n\nFile Name:                                      Punishment Park.avi                     \nFile Size (in bytes):                           1,401,851,904                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             40          \nPreload (in ms):                                512       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Split         \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:27:35                \nFrame Count:                                    131373             \nFrame Width x Height (pixels):                  640 x 480 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;                    1.333                     \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:                              25.000          \nPics Per Second:                                25.000            \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1868                 \nMPEG-4:                                         MPEG-4                   \n[B-VOP][QPel][GMC][NVOP][H264]:                 [B-VOP][][][N-VOP][]   \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.243&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nMPEG Stream ID (e.g. &quot;0xbd&quot;):                             \nMPEG VOB file Substream(e.g. &quot;0x80&quot;):                  \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            256                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            CBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf539b77fe77902e9dbb2d9ec09209e888f2d69","amp;dn":"Punishment+Park+%28Peter+Watkins%2C+1971%29+Masters+of+Cinema","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddf539b77fe77902e9dbb2d9ec09209e888f2d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,245,57,183,127,231,121,2,233,219,178,217,236,9,32,158,136,143,45,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
