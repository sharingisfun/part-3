Considered by some critics to be the pinnacle of their career, Lovedrive was a major evolution of the band's sound, exhibiting their &quot;classic style&quot; that would be later developed over their next few albums. Lovedrive cemented the &quot;Scorpions formula&quot; of heavy metal songs mixed with melodic ballads.\n\nLovedrive reached No. 55 on the US charts, demonstrating that the band was gathering an international following. The RIAA certified the record as Gold on 28 May 1986,  and the album ranked 25 on IGN's list of the top 25 metal albums. This is the first album to feature Matthias Jabs on lead guitar, and by extension, the first record to feature the band's &quot;classic&quot; lineup. Jabs replaced Uli Jon Roth, who went on to form his own band, Electric Sun.\n\nMichael Schenker, younger brother of rhythm guitarist Rudolf, who had just split from UFO, recorded the solo guitar parts on &quot;Another Piece Of Meat&quot;, &quot;Coast To Coast&quot; and &quot;Lovedrive&quot;. At the beginning of their German tour in February 1979 it was announced that Michael had rejoined the band. Scorpions had reluctantly parted with Matthias Jabs again. However, during the tour Michael once again informed his bandmates of his impending departure, which led to Jabs' return. The cover depicted a man and woman in formalwear seated in the back of a car, with one of the woman's breasts exposed and connected to the man's hand by stretched bubblegum. The back cover featured the same man and woman, but holding a photograph of the band, and her left breast completely exposed (without the gum). It was created by Storm Thorgerson of the design firm Hipgnosis. It caused some controversy upon the album's release and was subsequently banned, [by whom?] with later pressings of the album bearing a simple design of a blue scorpion on a black background. The album's artwork was named &quot;Best album sleeve of 1979&quot; by Playboy magazine. \n\nRecalling the cover photo with the girl and the car, Thorgerson remarked: &quot;Not exactly the most politically correct scene you've ever seen. I thought it was funny, but women read a different inflection into it now.&quot; \n\nIn a 2010 interview, singer Klaus Meine commented on the album cover, stating: &quot;We just did not know it would be a problem in America, it was just sex and rock 'n' roll. It is odd that in America some of these covers were a problem, because in the 80's when we would tour here, we always had boobs flashed to us at the front of the stage. Nowhere else in the world, just here. We just did not think it would be a problem to put out a record like Lovedrive in America. Deadly Sting: The Mercury Years was banned at Wal Mart and Pure Instinct was banned as well.&quot;[5]\n\nThis is one of the few Scorpions album covers that was initially edited upon release in many places because of its controversial nature, only to have the original uncensored art restored for the remaster series.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Loving You Sunday Morning&quot;   \tSchenker, Klaus Meine, Rarebell 5:36\n2. \t&quot;Another Piece of Meat&quot;   \tSchenker, Rarebell \t3:30\n3. \t&quot;Always Somewhere&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t4:56\n4. \t&quot;Coast to Coast&quot;   \tSchenker \t4:42\n5. \t&quot;Can't Get Enough&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t2:36\n6. \t&quot;Is There Anybody There?&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine, Rarebell \t3:58\n7. \t&quot;Lovedrive&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t4:49\n8. \t&quot;Holiday&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t6:32\n\n\n    Klaus Meine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals\n    Matthias Jabs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, backing vocals\n    Rudolf Schenker Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar, backing vocals, lead guitar on Always Somewhere\n    Francis Buchholz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals\n    Herman Rarebell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, backing vocals\n\n    Michael Schenker - lead guitar on Loving You Sunday Morning, Another Piece of Meat, Coast to Coast, Lovedrive &amp; Holiday\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89305ea273a3c099176e2783a66664de4cfb879c","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+Lovedrive+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89305ea273a3c099176e2783a66664de4cfb879c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,48,94,162,115,163,192,153,23,110,39,131,166,102,100,222,76,251,135,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
