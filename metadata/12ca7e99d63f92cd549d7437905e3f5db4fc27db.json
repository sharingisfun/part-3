You can do a clean install and it'll be activated AFTER you've already upgraded to Windows 10 once or have bought a valid licence.\r\n\r\nif you've already upgraded Windows 7/8 Home etc use the Windows 10 Home install on booting the DVD or from USB. If you've upgraded Pro already use the Pro install.\r\n\r\nYou can make a USB install using Rufus which is free. \r\n \nhttps://rufus.akeo.ie/ Make a GPT USB key if your PC supports UEFI, make a MBR key if it doesn't support UEFI.\r\nBoot from USB using UEFI if you made a GPT USB. If you can't boot UEFI you never used the GPT option in RUFUS or your BIOS doesn't support UEFI.\r\n\r\nYou can use this free Hash Checker http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hash_my_files.html to see the SHA1 of the ISO.\r\n\r\nCheck SHA-1 in Details on MSDN Website for the 1607 en-us version.\r\n \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/downloads/#searchTerm=windows%2010%201607&amp;ProductFamilyId=0&amp;Languages=en&amp;Architectures=x64&amp;ProductFamilyIds=657&amp;FileExtensions=.iso&amp;PageSize=10&amp;PageIndex=0&amp;FileId=0\r\n\r\nPlease seed at least a 1:1 ratio.\r\n\r\nHope this helps some. \r\n\r\nEdit: You can download the official Windows 10 Anniversary Update .iso from here. \r\n \nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO/\r\n\r\nDifferent file name but same SHA-1 as the MSDN version. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12ca7e99d63f92cd549d7437905e3f5db4fc27db","amp;dn":"en-us+Windows+10+Anniversary+Edition+July+Update+1607+Official+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12ca7e99d63f92cd549d7437905e3f5db4fc27db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,202,126,153,214,63,146,205,84,157,116,55,144,94,63,93,180,252,39,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
