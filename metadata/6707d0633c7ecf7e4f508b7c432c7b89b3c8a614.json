Walter Gropius founded this institute of design in 1919 in Weimar and it was effective in Weimar, Dessau and Berlin. The various professors, Walter Gropius (1919-1928), Hannes Meyer (1928-1930), and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1930-1933), were also renowned architects of their time. The works of the Bauhaus artists, Lyonel Feininger, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Gerhard Marcks, Oskar Schlemmer and LÃƒÂ¡szlÃƒÂ³ Moholy-Nagy as well as those of the students and young faculty members, Josef Albers, Herbert Bayer, Marcel Breuer, Gunta StÃƒÂ¶lzl and Joost Schmidt, were unanimously admired and aroused the interest of museums across the world. Their teachings in design are still observed in today's architecture and design schools and also in general art classes. The products of the Bauhaus, such as Marcel Breuer's well-known steel pipe furniture, became inexpensive classic design standards. The Bauhaus buildings have made architectural history and are now UNESCO World Heritage sites. The Bauhaus movement was built on the basis of new aesthetic perspectives and creative teaching programmes for the education of architects, designers and artists for a new, democratic society after WWI. Its syllabus was a combination of creative training, basic artistic knowledge, efficient workshop production, and learning to work as a team. Animated by a social awareness, the Bauhaus would soon combine its creativity with industrialisation and mass production and conceive numerous products which were not only beautiful but durable, useful and affordable. In 1933, the Nazis closed the Bauhaus, triggering the emigration of many of its members, many of whom chose America, and thus spreading the ideas of the Bauhaus worldwide. This book features an overview of the history of the Bauhaus, accompanied by rich visual documentation. The authors shed light on the evolution and connection of the Bauhaus with other movements, and render it easily comprehensible to the reader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6707d0633c7ecf7e4f508b7c432c7b89b3c8a614","amp;dn":"Bauhaus+1919-1933+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6707d0633c7ecf7e4f508b7c432c7b89b3c8a614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,7,208,99,60,126,207,126,79,80,139,124,67,44,123,137,179,200,166,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
