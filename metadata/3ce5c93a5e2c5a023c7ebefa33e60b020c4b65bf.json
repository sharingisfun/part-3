Published in six volumes, volume I was published in 1776 and went through six printings. Volumes II and III were published in 1781; volumes IV, V, VI in 1788Ã¢â‚¬â€œ89. The original volumes were published in quarto sections, a common publishing practice of the time. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, at the time its methodology became a model for later historians. This led to Gibbon being called the first &quot;modern historian of ancient Rome&quot;.\n\n\nThe notes below are from the NFO file for Volume 1, but the entire book is here, unabridged, in 64 kbps mp3.

Remarkably accurate \nfor its day, GibbonÃƒâ€ s treatise holds a high place in the history of \nliterature and remains an enduring subject of study.\n\nGibbonÃƒâ€ s monumental work traces the history of more than thirteen centuries, \ncovering the great events as well as the general historical progression. \nThis first volume covers A.D. 180 to A.D. 395, which includes the establishment \nof Christianity and the Crusades.\n\n\n\nEDWARD GIBBON (1737-1794), an English historian and Member of Parliament, \nhad little formal education. He went to Oxford, but was forced to leave \nwhen he converted to Roman Catholicism. His family then sent him to \nLausanne, where he was reconverted to Protestantism. His most important \nwork, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, was published in six \nvolumes between 1776 and 1788.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce5c93a5e2c5a023c7ebefa33e60b020c4b65bf","amp;dn":"Edward+Gibbon+-+Decline+and+Fall+of+the+Roman+Empire+%5Bcomplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce5c93a5e2c5a023c7ebefa33e60b020c4b65bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,229,201,58,94,44,90,2,60,126,190,250,51,230,11,2,12,75,101,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
