The origin and nature of &quot;Boogie Stop Shuffle&quot; is self-explanatory: a twelve-bar blues with four themes and a boogie bass backing that passes from stop time to shuffle and back.\n\n&quot;Self-Portrait in Three Colors&quot; was originally written for John Cassavetes' first film as director, Shadows, but was never used (for budgetary reasons). &quot;Open Letter to Duke&quot; is a tribute to Duke Ellington, and draws on three of Mingus's earlier pieces (&quot;Nouroog&quot;, &quot;Duke's Choice&quot;, and &quot;Slippers&quot;). &quot;Jelly Roll&quot; is a reference to jazz pioneer and pianist Jelly Roll Morton; &quot;Bird Calls,&quot; in Mingus' own words, was not a reference to bebop legend Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker: &quot;It wasn't supposed to sound like Charlie Parker. It was supposed to sound like birds - the first part.&quot;\n\n&quot;Fables of Faubus&quot; is named after Orval E. Faubus (1910Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1994), the Governor of Arkansas infamous for his 1957 stand against integration of Little Rock, Arkansas schools in defiance of U.S. Supreme Court rulings (forcing President Eisenhower to send in the National Guard). It is sometimes claimed that Columbia refused to allow the lyrics to be included on this album, though the liner notes to the 1998 reissue of the album state that the piece started life as an instrumental, and only gained the lyrics later (as can be heard on the 1960 release Presents Charles Mingus.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:514206e6ff38a599dff2ca985ab90ffc02bc897a","amp;dn":"Charlie+Mingus+-+Mingus+Ah+Um+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"514206e6ff38a599dff2ca985ab90ffc02bc897a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,66,6,230,255,56,165,153,223,242,202,152,90,185,15,252,2,188,137,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
