Although the 1st version is\nperfectly fine.. im a perfectionist... here's a sort of changelog:\n\n1. AdobePSPortable Rev.1\n* This is an update to 'AdobePSPortable' i released a few days ago.\n* Cleaned up the code for better, faster performance.\n* Added PDF, Color, Camera Raw support.\n\n2. Adobe Bridge CS5.1 Portable\n* I also decided to add 'Adobe Bridge' :)\n* Now these 2 apps. cannot communicate because it requires Switchboard service.\n* But 'Adobe Bridge' is still useful for Photographers as it allows you to \nimport pictures from your camera. I also added the Camera Raw Plug-in. \n* You can use 'AdobePSPortable' &amp; 'BridgePortable' simultaneously :)\n\n3. Camera Raw 6.6 Camera &amp; Lens Profiles Plugin\n* The reason i did not add this into 'AdobePSPortable' because of the size:\nit's almost 300MB. \n* This is only for Photographers who really need the additional Camera/Lens \nProfiles. If you're not a Photographer: do not download.\n* Due to the enormous size, load time takes longer... so only add this to \n'AdobePSPortable' if you really, really need/use it.\n* For a complete listing of all Camera/Lens Profiles: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/extend.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/extend.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[SiZE]\n- Adobe Photoshop: 124MB\n- Adobe Bridge: 62MB\n- Camera Raw 6.6 Camera &amp; Lens Profile Plugin: 40MB\n\n[INCLUDED LANGUAGES]\nCzech, Danish, German, English, Spanish, Spanish International, Finnish, French,\nHungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Dutch, Polish, Brazilian \nPortuguese, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Chinese (Simple), \nChinese (Traditional).\n\n[ADDITIONAL ITEMS]\n* 3D Invigorator (v5.07): www.digitalanarchy.com/3Dinvig/main.html\n* Frischluft Flair Plugin Pack (v1.23): www.frischluft.com/flair/index.php\n* Talk-Mania Styles, Gradients, Color Pallete/Table, and Actions.\n* Grafpedia Styles, Gradients, Color Pallete/Table, and Actions.\n* and a few other Styles from my personal collection.\n\n[NOTES]\n* Fonts: install on your computer and Photoshop will be able to use it: i \nhighly recommend a Font Manger to avoid installion which leads to a slow\nPC. I use 'NexusFont': www.portablefreeware.com/index.php?id=731\n* You can add more plugins by installing into:\nAdobePSPortable &gt; App &gt; Photoshop &gt; Plug-ins\n* make sure you test for 'stealth': many plugins leave trash behind.\n* The same applies to Styles, Gradients, Actions, etc:\nInstall into: AdobePSPortable &gt; App &gt; Photoshop &gt; Presets\n* You can greatly enhance Photoshop's performance by adjusting the RAM in \nsettings.\n* If you experience slow startup, check your plugins, you may have too many.\n* This includes the latest updates as of December 23, 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08477f8b9a08a0878568285febc2031a79c52064","amp;dn":"Adobe.Photoshop.CS5.1.Rev.1.Incl.Adobe.Bridge.Portable.Multiling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08477f8b9a08a0878568285febc2031a79c52064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,71,127,139,154,8,160,135,133,104,40,95,235,194,3,26,121,197,32,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
