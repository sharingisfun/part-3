Bardon brings the resources of over 2500 years of philosophy and science to bear on some of humanity's most fundamental and enduring questions.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2c17b24994c2119dd01b4952813c5bff6b2d41e","amp;dn":"A+Brief+History+of+the+Philosophy+of+Time+%282013%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2c17b24994c2119dd01b4952813c5bff6b2d41e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,193,123,36,153,76,33,25,221,1,180,149,40,19,197,191,246,178,212,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
