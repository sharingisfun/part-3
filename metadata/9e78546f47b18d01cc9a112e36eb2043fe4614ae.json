Once available in France on vinyl, these were among the very first commercial records of Malian music.\n\nAs a single collection, this is the finest yet of Toure's slow-burning music, characterized by nimble, expressive guitar playing and strong, expressive singing.\n\nHalf the tunes feature Toure alone on guitar and vocals; elsewhere he is backed by the ngoni's beautiful rattle-buzz, a full choir, a smattering of percussion, and a violin player whose sliding, high-pitched notes echo the fiddle playing of Appalachia. Throughout, Toure's singing has a wider range than you'd expect (considering that he's known as the &quot;African John Lee Hooker&quot;) and his bluesy guitar playing is always melodic, modal, and meditative. \n\nThe connections between American Blues and the sounds of the Sahel are clearly apparent.\n\nThis is some mind-blowing stuff, a hypnotic master class.\n\n\n\nAli Farka TourÃƒÂ©\n\nRadio Mali\n\n1970 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1978\n\n \n\n CD / 1996 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
