It is based on Faith Morrison's vision that flows are both beautiful and complex. A swollen creek tumbles over rocks and through crevasses, swirling and foaming. Taffy can be stretched, reshaped, and twisted in various ways. Both the water and the taffy are fluids and their motions are governed by the laws of nature. The goal of this textbook is to introduce the reader to the analysis of flows using the laws of physics and the language of mathematics. This text delves deeply into the mathematical analysis of flows, because knowledge of the patterns fluids form and why they are formed and the stresses fluids generate and why they are generated is essential to designing and optimizing modern systems and devices. Inventions such as helicopters and lab-on-a-chip reactors would never have been designed without the insight brought by mathematical models.\n\nAbout the Author\nFaith Morrison is Professor of Chemical Engineering at Michigan Technological University. She is the Past President of the Society of Rheology and Editor of the Rheology Bulletin. Her research focuses on rheological, optical and scattering techniques to probe the morphology of flowing liquids. This research explores systems with structure, including high-molecular-weight polymers and block copolymers and sol-gels and suspensions. In addition to her research publications, Morrison is the author of Understanding Rheology (2001).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388bfcfc83df88139da8d35091a340ef4fc621b3","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Fluid+Mechanics-+Morrison+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388bfcfc83df88139da8d35091a340ef4fc621b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,139,252,252,131,223,136,19,157,168,211,80,145,163,64,239,79,198,33,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
