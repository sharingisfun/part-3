Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. \n\nTHE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Boss from Hell.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Narrated in AndreaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to MirandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every dayÃ¢â‚¬â€and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.\n\nRevenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns (The Devil Wears Prada #2) by Lauren Weisberger (June 4th 2013) \n\nAlmost a decade has passed since Andy Sachs quit the job Ã¢â‚¬Å“a million girls would die forÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ working for Miranda Priestly at Runway magazineÃ¢â‚¬â€a dream that turned out to be a nightmare. Andy and Emily, her former nemesis and co-assistant, have since joined forces to start a highend bridal magazine. The Plunge has quickly become required reading for the young and stylish. Now they get to call all the shots: Andy writes and travels to her heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content; Emily plans parties and secures advertising like a seasoned pro. Even better, Andy has met the love of her life. Max Harrison, scion of a storied media family, is confident, successful, and drop-dead gorgeous. Their wedding will be splashed across all the society pages as their friends and family gather to toast the glowing couple. Andy Sachs is on top of the world. But karmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bitch. The morning of her wedding, Andy canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shake the past. And when she discovers a secret letter with crushing implications, her wedding-day jitters turn to cold dread. Andy realizes that nothingÃ¢â‚¬â€not her husband, nor her beloved careerÃ¢â‚¬â€is as it seems. She never suspected that her efforts to build a bright new life would lead her back to the darkness she barely escaped ten years agoÃ¢â‚¬â€and directly into the path of the devil herself. . .\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7a0031fa7e3522823f429f8fb4ab0d0a7ea225","amp;dn":"The+Devil+Wears+Prada+Series+%281-2%29+by+Lauren+Weisberger+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7a0031fa7e3522823f429f8fb4ab0d0a7ea225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,122,0,49,250,126,53,34,130,63,66,159,143,180,171,13,10,126,162,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
