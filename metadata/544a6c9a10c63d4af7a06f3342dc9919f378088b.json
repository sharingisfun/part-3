He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater.\n\nLehrer is best known for the pithy, humorous songs he recorded in the 1950s and 60s. His work often parodied popular song forms, notably in \\&quot;The Elements\\&quot;, where he sets the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the \\&quot;Major-General\\&amp;#039;s Song\\&quot; from Gilbert and Sullivan\\&amp;#039;s Pirates of Penzance. Lehrer\\&amp;#039;s earlier work frequently dealt with trivial subject matter, but he also produced a number of songs dealing with the social and political issues of the day, particularly when he went on to write for the TV show That Was The Week That Was.\n\nThe Remains of Tom Lehrer was, as the title suggests, the presumed final album by Tom Lehrer. Released in 2000, The Remains of Tom Lehrer is a box set that consists of all the songs from Tom Lehrer\\&amp;#039;s previous albums along with previously unreleased songs and his works featured in The Electric Company. Some of the songs from his debut album, Songs By Tom Lehrer, were re-recorded for the CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:544a6c9a10c63d4af7a06f3342dc9919f378088b","amp;dn":"Tom+Lehrer+-+The+remains+of+Tom+Lehrer+%283CD+complete+box+set%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"544a6c9a10c63d4af7a06f3342dc9919f378088b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,74,108,154,16,198,61,74,247,160,111,51,66,220,153,25,243,120,8,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
