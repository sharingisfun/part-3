The Jeffers Corporation is the largest business in the history of humankind, and they got that way thanks to their strict philosophy of happiness through mindless productivity. But when people begin literally exploding due to unhappiness, Jeffers Corporation Level Three Visioneer George Washington Winsterhammerman (Zach Galifianakis) begins to fear that his time will come sooner rather than later. George lives a comfortable yet completely uneventful life, and when he starts having dreams in which he's the first President of the United States, his doctor informs him that they could be signs of impending explosion. Later, as the dreams become more frequent and his co-workers continue to detonate, George is prompted to reevaluate his mundane existence. Judy Greer, Missi Pyle, and James LeGros co-star in an existential black comedy featuring music by Tim DeLaughter of the Polyphonic Spree. \n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY CLOWNSEC\nimage\n* HONK *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea61c08aa369a94e1ad0379996c7a874c2197864","amp;dn":"Visioneers+%282008%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+CLOWNSEC+%28PhreakyFlix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea61c08aa369a94e1ad0379996c7a874c2197864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,97,192,138,163,105,169,78,26,208,55,153,150,199,168,116,194,25,120,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
