According to the band's official website, &quot;The seed was sown in an attic in the middle of a hot summer when friends Jack White and Brendan Benson got together and wrote a song that truly inspired them. This song was 'Steady, As She Goes' and the inspiration led to the creation of a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler.&quot; The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and recorded when time allowed for the remainder of the year. Due to the various members' success in other bands, they were quickly dubbed a supergroup. The band, however, asserted they were not, saying that the term implies something pre-planned or temporary, whereas they are actually &quot;a new band made up of old friends.&quot;[2]\n\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0a652d527df26dadc737320ad1f463d80ae9017","amp;dn":"Raconteurs+-+Discography+2006+-+2008+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0a652d527df26dadc737320ad1f463d80ae9017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,166,82,213,39,223,38,218,220,115,115,32,173,31,70,61,128,174,144,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
