Singer and lyricist Geri Soriano-Lightwood fronts a trio of loop-mongers-Kiran Shahani (bass, programming), Ramin Sakurai (keyboards, programming) and Rick Torres (guitar, programming)-who, as is obvious from their intelligent tracks, have done their homework. Slow hip-hop/jazz grooves, fired with synthesized sitars, piccolo snares and big-drop bass, make for a sound worth hearing over and over.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e0d18422904680a6070769d82a5c4c55e79674","amp;dn":"Supreme+Beings+Of+Leisure+%28Album%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e0d18422904680a6070769d82a5c4c55e79674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,224,209,132,34,144,70,128,166,7,7,105,216,42,92,76,85,231,150,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
