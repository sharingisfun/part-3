Sun's Arising (A Koan, An Exit)\n\nA new Phosphorescent LP and that can only mean one thing: that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be listening to a beautiful record. Muchacho sets its stall out pretty much from the off with a veritable salvo of velvety, sepia-tinged tracks, choc-full of harmonies and cloying mid-tones and rich textures. Sun, Arise (An Invocation, An Introduction), Song for Zula and Ride On / Right On envelop the listener in a warm, soft world, one where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safe to share your innermost thoughts. And it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop there, some tracks moving towards a pure pop sound, indeed on A Charm / A Blade it seems the mask has cracked to reveal the wearer: Houck seemingly joins Abba Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that easy, hopeful melody contrasted with a bittersweet subject, the lashings and lashings of choral vox, the happy clappy beat; the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up. \nNow, normally I run a mile from too much comfy feel good music, but Phosphorescent is something different. For one, Matthew Houck can play the Ã¢â‚¬Å“feelingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ card better than most. And thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enough in the lyrics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and in some of the frankly baffling song titles - to suggest that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not someone who just relies on his way with a pretty melody: Ã¢â‚¬Å“kill you with my bare handsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“I can be the devilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been fucked up, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been a foolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ spring to mind, and then there are lines about smashing things up, losing his temper etceteraÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ In that respect itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic Country &amp; Western: the loner boy growing up the hard way and learning humility through lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simple lessons.\nBefore you start retching into a bucket, it must be said that Houck also has a brilliant knack of making the most mundane event sound like something life changing: it may be tear jerking stuff, but to be fair to him, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s believable; you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think that any of the emoting is for effect. But most of all itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that warm, cracked voice that lifts his music out of the ordinary. He sings in a manner that just takes no prisoners, and what with a rich dollop of harmony thrown in pretty much everywhere, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult not to be won over, especially when the music dovetails with the message, as in the brilliant A New Anhedonia or the The Quotidian Beasts, which blossoms out into a tough, increasingly impassioned confessional. \nSo in retrospect, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve not heard before, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a lot of this winsome, elegiac 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s / 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s country rock in recent years. I also donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t subscribe to the consensus that simply making a beautiful record is a good thing: at times youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to hear something a little sparser or rougherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ music like this can suffocate, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only a minor quibble. You could say, if you wanted to pick a fight (the wrong one IMHO), that Houck treads very safe ground. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really argue with any of the songs, or the way that Phosphorescent sings them. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty bloody impressive, this LP.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1acd10d4a2aae3d41e102181ebb488e3834c79fa","amp;dn":"Phosphorescent+-+Muchacho+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1acd10d4a2aae3d41e102181ebb488e3834c79fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,205,16,212,162,170,227,212,30,16,33,129,235,180,136,227,131,76,121,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
