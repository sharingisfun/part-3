Sule (CRC, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nFierce global competition in manufacturing has made proficient facilities planning a mandatory issue in industrial engineering and technology. From plant layout and materials handling to quality function deployment and design considerations, Manufacturing Facilities: Location, Planning, and Design, Third Edition covers a wide range of topics crucial to the efficiency of a well-planned facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nProper Planning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThoroughly updated and revised, the third edition of this classic volume provides the information and analytical tools necessary to move from product designs to production plans and then details all of the planning techniques needed to build a manufacturing facility where safety, efficiency, and profit are interdependent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDivided into two parts, the first section describes all the factors involved in setting up a manufacturing plant. It covers product design, the choice of manufacturing processes, and plant layout, as well as production, material-handling, and storage systems. The author also highlights the importance of the selection of labor resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nProper Location\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second part examines subjective aspects, such as how to maximize efficiency and save resources. It discusses how to choose the best location and how to assign customers to each facility to minimize the overall cost of operation. It also reviews the process of selecting sites for proximity to emergency service facilities, and explains how to determine the best layout within a building for tool rooms, materials, machining, shipping, inspection, and other departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nProper Attitude\r\n\r\n\r\nWise planning results in efficient allocation of available resources for any project. This comprehensive reference empowers engineers, facility planners, and students in manufacturing programs to effectively develop both the method and the mindset required to create an efficient and integrated production facility","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b4f0cf793fa1ab5506fbd9f8579497c7596c208","amp;dn":"Manufacturing+Facilities+-+Location%2C+Planning%2C+and+Design+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b4f0cf793fa1ab5506fbd9f8579497c7596c208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,79,12,247,147,250,26,181,80,111,189,159,133,121,73,124,117,150,194,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
