Released in 2004, it is the sequel to Need for Speed: Underground, and is part of the Need for Speed series, available on GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance and Windows. It was developed by EA Black Box.\n\nThe game is based around tuning cars for street races, resuming the Need for Speed: Underground storyline. Need for Speed: Underground 2 provides several new features, such as a broader customization, new methods of selecting races, the &quot;explore&quot; mode (just driving around freely, like the Midnight Club series, in a large city known as &quot;Bayview&quot;). Underground 2 also introduces several SUVs, which could be customized as extensively as other Underground 2 vehicles and used to race against other SUV racers. Brooke Burke is the voice of Rachel Teller, the person who guides the player through the story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:703f7b3678e155e9ba5b065bcb890e9247a118d4","amp;dn":"Need+for+Speed+Underground+2+%281-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"703f7b3678e155e9ba5b065bcb890e9247a118d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,63,123,54,120,225,85,233,186,91,6,91,203,137,14,146,71,161,24,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
