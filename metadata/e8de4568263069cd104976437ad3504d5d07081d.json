Implementation is hard. This book helps you with the hard part.&quot;\n-Guy Kawasaki, author of Enchantment\n\nAccording to productivity expert Scott Belsky, no one is born with the ability to drive creative projects to completion. Execution is a skill that must be developed by building your organizational habits and harnessing the support of your colleagues.\n \nAs the founder and CEO of Behance, a company on a mission to empower and organize the creative world, Belsky has studied the habits of especially productive individuals and teams across industries. Now he has compiled the principles and techniques they share, and presents a systematic approach to creative organization and productivity.\n \nWhile many of us focus on generating and searching for great ideas, Belsky shows why it's better to develop the capacity to make ideas happen-a capacity that endures over time.\n  \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8de4568263069cd104976437ad3504d5d07081d","amp;dn":"Making+Ideas+Happen+-+Overcoming+the+Obstacles+-+Scott+Belsky+%5BE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8de4568263069cd104976437ad3504d5d07081d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,222,69,104,38,48,105,205,16,73,118,67,122,211,80,77,93,7,8,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
