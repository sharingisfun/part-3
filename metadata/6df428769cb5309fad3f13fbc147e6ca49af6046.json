Utilizing interviews with a variety of experts to explain their thoughts and experiences with DMT within their respective fields, and discussions with StrassmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s research volunteers brings to life the awesome effects of this compound, and far-reaching theories regarding its role in human consciousness.\n\nSeveral themes explored include possible roles for endogenous DMT; its theoretical role in near-death and birth experiences, alien-abduction experiences; and the uncanny similarities in Biblical prophetic texts describing DMT-like experiences. Our expert contributors offer a comprehensive collection of information, opinions, and speculation about indigenous use of DMT, the history and future of psychedelic research, and current DMT research. All this, to help us understand the nature of the DMT experience, and its role in human society and evolution.\n\nThe subtle combination of science, spirituality, and philosophy within the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach sheds light on an array of ideas that could considerably alter the way humans understand the universe and their relationship to it.\n\n[b][u]Interviews and Q&amp;A (2010)[/u][/b]\nThe premiere of Mitch ShultzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film took place on September 26th, 2010 at the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, the home of visionary artist Alex Grey. This video contains interviews with Mitch and Dr. Strassman, as well as an hour long Q&amp;A with the audience of the official screening. The Q&amp;A features Strassman, Schultz, along with Alex &amp; Allyson Grey, and is one of the few videos to be allowed to shoot in their sacred space.\n\n[b][u]DMT: The Spirit Molecule (2000)[/u][/b]\nFrom 1990 to 1995 Dr. Rick Strassman conducted DEA-approved clinical research at the University of New Mexico in which he injected sixty volunteers with DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. His detailed account of those sessions is an extraordinarily riveting inquiry into the nature of the human mind and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. DMT, a plant-derived chemical that is also manufactured by the human brain, consistently produced out-of-body, near-death, and mystical experiences. Many volunteers reported convincing encounters with intelligent nonhuman presences: angels, aliens, spirits. Nearly all agreed that the sessions were among the most intense experiences of their lives.\n\nStrassman's research connects DMT with the pineal gland, considered by Hindus to be the site of the sixth chakra and by Rene Descartes to be the seat of the soul. DMT: The Spirit Molecule makes the bold case that DMT, naturally released by the pineal gland, facilitates the soul's movement in and out of the body and is an integral part of the birth and death experiences, as well as the highest states of meditation and even sexual transcendence. Strassman also believes that alien abduction experiences are brought on by accidental releases of DMT. If used wisely, DMT could trigger a period of remarkable progress in the scientific exploration of the most mystical regions of the human mind and soul.\n\nBuy [url=http://thespiritmolecule.com/]The Spirit Molecule[/url] directed by Mitch Shultz on DVD for $20.\n\nBuy [url=http://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278]DMT: The Spirit Molecule[/url] written by Rick Strassman for $12.\n\nBuy [url=http://www.amazon.com/Inner-Paths-Outer-Space-Psychedelics/dp/159477224X]Inner Paths to Outer Space[/url] co-written by Rick Strassman for $14.\n\nBuy [url=http://www.amazon.com/Transfigurations-Alex-Grey/dp/1594770174/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1291259822&amp;sr=8-2]Transfigurations[/url] illustrated by Alex Grey for $26.\n\n\n[b]For more information, check out:[/b]\n[url=http://thespiritmolecule.com/]The Spirit Molecule[/url]\n[url=http://www.rickstrassman.com/]Dr. Rick Strassman[/url]\n[url=http://www.alexgrey.com/]Alex Grey[/url]\nInterviews[/url]\n[url=http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_DMT.shtml]DMT User Experiences[/url]\n[url=http://electricsheep.org/]Electric Sheep[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6df428769cb5309fad3f13fbc147e6ca49af6046","amp;dn":"DMT%3A+The+Spirit+Molecule+%5BComplete+Collection%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6df428769cb5309fad3f13fbc147e6ca49af6046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,244,40,118,156,181,48,159,173,63,19,251,193,71,230,202,73,175,96,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
