Songs performed are:\n\nThe Ecstasy Of Gold\nThe Call Of Ktulu\nMaster Of Puppets\nOf Wolf And Man\nThe Thing That Should Not Be\nFuel\nThe Memory Remains\nNo Leaf Clover\nHero Of The Day\nDevil's Dance\nBleeding Me\n\n\nPart 2 is the second half of the show I would've given a kidney to see.  Songs performed are:\n\nNothing Else Matters\nUntil It Sleeps\nFor Whom The Bell Tolls\n- Human\nWherever I May Roam\nThe Outlaw Torn\nSad But True\nOne\nEnter Sandman\nBattery  \n\n\nPart 3 is &quot;The Making Of&quot; documentary.  Encoded at 2000 Kbps and 30 fps due to the fact I could get away with it because of the 40 minute runtime.  It's a look into what was involved with a performance of that magnitude, and Metallica is completely out of their element working with an orchestra.  It's like watching soccer hooligans at a tennis match.\n\n\nPart 4 is the music video for &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot;.  Encoded at an absolutely retarded bitrate of 6000 Kbps and 30 fps.  It's a track that had never been heard before the night of the performance.  &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; was the best song of the night and became a smash hit around the world. \n\n\n\n\nRipped by Lem and released to: Icefilms.info, DarksideRG, ThePirateBay.org and That's What She Watched\n\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0192c92203c309a7dad7f827d2753791a2de33fb","amp;dn":"Metallica+S%26M+%281999%29+%5BDVDRip%5D+%5BEng%5D+%5BLem%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0192c92203c309a7dad7f827d2753791a2de33fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,146,201,34,3,195,9,167,218,215,248,39,210,117,55,145,162,222,51,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
