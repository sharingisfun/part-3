The Big O, a.k.a. Lefty Wilbury, a.k.a. Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Caruso of Rock,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ never did anything small.  His big, booming voice gave life to a series of painfully heartbreaking yet irresistible ballads that sounded like nothing else in rock and roll or pop. Orbison brought an authenticity and urgency to the dramatic songs he wrote and recorded, but when he cut loose on an Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ooby DoobyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh, Pretty Woman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his voice could also be the sound of freedom and lust and excitement.\nWith the February 7, 1989 release of Mystery Girl, the music of Roy Orbison was riding high. The album went Top 5 on the Billboard 200, propelled by the Top 10 success of Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Got It,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which returned the singer to the Top 40 for the first time in 24 years. Unfortunately, the success ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nMystery Girl was bittersweet, as Orbison had passed away a scant couple of months prior to its release, on December 6, 1988.  On May 20, 2014, Legacy Recordings and RoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Boys LLC will celebrate this triumphant posthumous comeback with the release of a CD/DVD Deluxe Edition, a 15-track Mystery Girl Expanded Edition on CD, and a double-LP set.\n\nWhile Roy Orbison didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live to see the release of Mystery Girl, he did get to enjoy a resurgence of popularity.  David LynchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1986 cult classic Blue Velvet prominently utilized RoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haunting Ã¢â‚¬Å“In Dreams.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  That same year, he reunited with old friends Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins for the Sun Records reunion disc Class of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢55, and revisited many of his seminal recordings on In Dreams: The Greatest Hits.  1988 was another monumental year for The Big O.  He began the year with the broadcast on Cinemax of A Black and White Night, for which he was supported by a band of admirers.  And this little band was the greatest in the land, featuring James Burton, Jerry Scheff, Ronnie Tutt and Glen D. Hardin from fellow Sun alumnus Elvis PresleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TCB Band along with T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, J.D. Souther, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes and k.d. lang.  (Whew!)  Later in 1988, Warner Bros. released the first album by the mysterious Traveling Wilburys.  Rumor has it that Nelson, Otis, Lefty, Charlie and Lucky were, in fact, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and Bob Dylan!\n\nWork on the album that would become Mystery Girl began during The WilburysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sessions.  Songs were contributed by Orbison himself along with Diane Warren, Albert Hammond, Elvis Costello, Wesley Orbison, and U2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Bono and The Edge.  Jeff Lynne, T Bone Burnett, Bono, and the team of Orbison and Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell all produced tracks for the LP.  Campbell, Howie Epstein and Benmont Tench of the Heartbreakers all played on Mystery Girl, as did Al Kooper and George Harrison.  The infectious Orbison/Petty/Lynne Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Got ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ became the lead track on the album.  As gleamingly produced by Lynne in the style of the WilburysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recordings, it became one of RoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest hits.\n\nDrawn from studio recordings and demos, the nine new audio tracks include Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Way is LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“newly restored Roy Orbison vocal track layered with contemporary guitar, drum and vocal accompaniment by RoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three sons (Roy Jr., Alex and Wesley).Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  The song was discovered on a work tape by Roy and his frequent collaborator Bill Dees RoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals were found on a previously unheard Roy Orbison/Bill Dees work tape, originally recorded on a boombox cassette player.  Producer John Carter Cash restored the track in a manner similar to the recordings on his father Johnny CashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Out Among the Stars, building a new track around OrbisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existing vocal.  Cash added Wesley and Roy Jr. on guitar as well as Alex on drums, and all three sons on background vocals.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fdfe9b6f4785ef00c997ab6f40763aa84fc4873","amp;dn":"Roy+Orbison+-+Mystery+Girl+%5B25th+Anniversary+Deluxe+Edition%5D+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fdfe9b6f4785ef00c997ab6f40763aa84fc4873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,223,233,182,244,120,94,240,12,153,122,182,244,7,99,170,132,252,72,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
