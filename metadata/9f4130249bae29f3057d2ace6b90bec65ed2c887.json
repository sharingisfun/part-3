Geils, and the jack of many trades Seth Justman on keyboards, the J. Geils Band was one of the most popular touring rock &amp; roll bands in America during the '70s, a nonstop blast of energy, fun, and sweat.\n \nWhere their contemporaries were influenced by the heavy boogie of British blues-rock and the ear-splitting sonic adventures of psychedelia, The J. Geils Band was a bar band pure and simple, churning out greasy covers of obscure R&amp;B, doo wop, and soul tunes, cutting them with a healthy dose of Stonesy swagger. \nIn the early '80s, the group tempered its driving rock with some pop, and the makeover paid off with the massive hit single &quot;Centerfold,&quot; which stayed at number one for six weeks. \n\n\n\nThe J.
