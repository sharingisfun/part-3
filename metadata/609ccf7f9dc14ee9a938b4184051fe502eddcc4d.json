In many cases, more than one solution is given to a single problem in order to highlight different problem-solving strategies. The collection is intended as practice for students preparing for these competitions. Teachers and general readers looking for interesting problems will find also it very useful","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:609ccf7f9dc14ee9a938b4184051fe502eddcc4d","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Olympiads+1998--1999%3A+Problems+and+Solutions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"609ccf7f9dc14ee9a938b4184051fe502eddcc4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,156,207,127,157,193,78,233,169,56,180,24,64,81,254,80,46,221,204,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
