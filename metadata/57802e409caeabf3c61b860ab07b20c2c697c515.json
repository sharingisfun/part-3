Six years of hiding a broken heart by throwing himself into his career as a college professor. Six years of keeping his promise to leave Natalie alone, and six years of tortured dreams of her life with her new husband, Todd.\n\nBut six years havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come close to extinguishing his feelings, and when Jake comes across ToddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obituary, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep himself away from the funeral. There he gets the glimpse of ToddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hoping forÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but she is not Natalie. Whoever the mourning widow is, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been married to Todd for almost two decades, and with that fact everything Jake thought he knew about the best time of his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€a time he has never gotten overÃ¢â‚¬â€is turned completely inside out. \n\nAs Jake searches for the truth, his picture-perfect memories of Natalie begin to unravel. Mutual friends of the couple either canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be found, or donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember Jake. No one has seen Natalie in years. JakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s search for the woman who broke his heart, who lied to him, soon puts his very life at risk as it dawns on him that the man he has become may be based on a carefully constructed fiction.\n\nFull Retail ePub. Calibre ready.
