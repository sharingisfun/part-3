He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. Fitzgerald is considered a member of the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; of the 1920s. He finished four novels: This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby (his most famous), and Tender Is the Night. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon, was published posthumously. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that treat themes of youth and promise along with age and despair.\n\nThe Great Gatsby has been the basis for numerous films of the same name, spanning nearly 90 years; 1926, 1949, 1974, 2000, and 2013 adaptations. In 1958, his life from 1937 to 1940 was dramatized in Beloved Infidel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:142156e0929356b728d0c5516b0d6451ff5a879d","amp;dn":"Complete+Works+of+F.+Scott+Fitzgerald+%28Illustrated%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"142156e0929356b728d0c5516b0d6451ff5a879d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,33,86,224,146,147,86,183,40,208,197,81,107,13,100,81,255,90,135,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
