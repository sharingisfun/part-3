While we do not recommend using this feature, for those with lag issues, this addition can be useful to make the piano more Ã¢â‚¬Å“pop-likeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ however, it will remove the Ã¢â‚¬Å“weightedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feel of the piano.\n\n= Tape Sample Replace\n\nWe have re-recorded all the sample sets back through a physical (not a plugin) Studer tape machine with better leveling to remove the Ã¢â‚¬Å“crunchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the top velocities. ALL samples have been replaced for the tape setting. We also painstakingly re-denoised all of the samples, so there is very little tape noise buildup in the background. We highly recommend adding a bit of tape noise back in to blend the samples together. You will notice some tape artifacts in some of the samples, but this is part of the natural sound of using tape.\n\n\nUse DAEMON Tools Pro to mount, open the ISO then extract the library.\n\nDownload here\n\nthepiratebay.se/torrent/7829641","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5838a25ced3dcdb7b43ed1bcce0628f09357ac3e","amp;dn":"Cinesamples+-+Piano+in+Blue+V2+%5BKONTAKT%5D%5BISO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5838a25ced3dcdb7b43ed1bcce0628f09357ac3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,56,162,92,237,61,205,183,180,62,209,188,206,6,40,240,147,87,172,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
