In 2009, the Guinness World Records cited her as the most-awarded female act of all time. Her list of awards includes two Emmy Awards, six Grammy Awards, 30 Billboard Music Awards, and 22 American Music Awards, among a total of 415 career awards as of 2010. Houston was also one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 170 million albums, singles and videos worldwide. Inspired by prominent soul singers in her family, including her mother Cissy Houston, cousins Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick, and her godmother Aretha Franklin, Houston began singing with her New Jersey church's junior gospel choir at age 11. After she began performing alongside her mother in night clubs in the New York City area, she was discovered by Arista Records label head Clive Davis. Houston released seven studio albums and three movie soundtrack albums, all of which have diamond, multi-platinum, platinum or gold certification.\nHouston is the only artist to chart seven consecutive No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hits (&quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot;, &quot;How Will I Know&quot;, &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, &quot;Didn't We Almost Have It All&quot;, &quot;So Emotional&quot; and &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot;). She is the second artist behind Elton John and the only female artist to have two number-one Billboard 200 Album awards (formerly &quot;Top Pop Album&quot;) on the Billboard magazine year-end charts. Houston's 1985 debut album Whitney Houston became the best-selling debut album by a female act at the time of its release. The album was named Rolling Stone's best album of 1986, and was ranked at number 254 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Her second studio album Whitney (1987) became the first album by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart.[7] Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts as well as her prominence on MTV, starting with her video for &quot;How Will I Know&quot;, influenced several African-American female artists to follow in her footsteps.\nHouston's first acting role was as the star of the feature film The Bodyguard (1992). The film's original soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Its lead single &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, became the best-selling single by a female artist in music history. With the album, Houston became the first act (solo or group, male or female) to sell more than a million copies of an album within a single week period. The album makes her the only female act in the top 10 list of the best-selling albums of all time, at number four. Houston continued to star in movies and contribute to their soundtracks, including the films Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's Wife (1996). The Preacher's Wife soundtrack became the best-selling gospel album in history. Three years after the release of her fourth studio album My Love Is Your Love (1998), she renewed her recording contract with Arista Records. She released her fifth studio album Just Whitney in 2002, and the Christmas-themed One Wish: The Holiday Album in 2003. In 2009, Houston released her seventh studio album, I Look to You.\nOn February 11, 2012, Houston died of currently unknown causes at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California.\n\n.: Whitney Houston :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/971/12641595.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/971/12641595.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Album :.\n\nStudio albums\n1987 - Whitney\n1990 - I'm Your Baby Tonight (Japan)\n1998 - My Love Is Your Love\n2002 - Just Whitney (Limited Edition)\n2009 - I Look To You (Japan)\n2010 - Whitney Houston -25'th Anniversary Edition (Japan)\n\nSoundtracks\n1992 - The Bodyguard\n1995 - Waiting To Exhale\n1996 - The Preacher's Wife\n\nCompilation and other albums\n2000 - The Greatest Hits (2 CD)\n2001 - Love, Whitney\n2003 - One Wish (The Holiday Album)\n2007 - The Ultimate Collection\n\nSome singles\n1992 - I Will Always Love You (Single)\n1995 - Exhale (Shoop Shoop)(Single)\n1998 - Its Not Right But It's Okay (The Dance Mixes) (Single)\n1998 - Mariah Carey &amp; Whitney Houston - When You Believe (From The Prince Of Egypt) (CD-Maxi)\n1999 - Whitney Houston &amp; George Michael - If I Told You That (CD-Maxi)\n2009 - Million Dollar Bill","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9619729de90438a140a793450a90301d946ef8a6","amp;dn":"Whitney+Houston+-+Discography+1987-2010+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Villa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9619729de90438a140a793450a90301d946ef8a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,25,114,157,233,4,56,161,64,167,147,69,10,144,48,29,148,110,248,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
