Calvin (Ice Cube), who inherited the struggling business from his deceased father, views the shop as nothing but a burden and a waste of his time. After selling the shop to a local loan shark, Calvin slowly begins to see his father's vision and legacy and struggles with the notion that he just sold it out.&quot;\r\n\r\nBarbershop 2: Back in Business (2004) - &quot;This sequel to the 2002 film returns to the Chicago barbershop owned by Calvin Palmer Jr. (Ice Cube). His employees -- Isaac (Troy Garity), Terri (Eve), Ricky (Michael Ealy), Dinka (Leonard Earl Howze) and Kenard -- have their own personal and workplace problems, and a new barbershop called Nappy Cutz has moved in across the street. As Calvin tries to change the character of his business, Nappy Cutz and gentrification become a threat to the surrounding community.&quot;\r\n\r\nBeauty Shop (2005) - &quot;Far from Chicago, hairdresser Gina Norris (Queen Latifah) has relocated to Atlanta with her daughter (Paige Hurd) and has quickly established herself as a rare talent in her profession. But after repeatedly butting heads with her shady, over-the-top boss, Jorge (Kevin Bacon), Norris sets out to create her own salon -- even snagging a few of Jorge's employees and clients, including Lynn (Alicia Silverstone) and Terri (Andie MacDowell), respectively. Now, Jorge will do anything to shut her down.&quot;\r\n\r\nBarbershop 3: The NEXT Cut (2016) - &quot;To survive harsh economic times, Calvin and Angie have merged the barbershop and beauty salon into one business. The days of male bonding are gone as Eddie and the crew must now contend with sassy female co-workers and spirited clientele. As the battle of the sexes rages on, a different kind of conflict has taken over Chicago. Crime and gangs are on the rise, leaving Calvin worried about the fate of his son. Together, the friends come up with a bold plan to take back their beloved neighborhood.&quot;\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nName (Title): BARBERSHOP Movie Series - 1, 2: Back in Business, Beauty Shop, 3: The Next Cut - 720p\r\n\r\nCategory Type: Movies\r\n\r\nLength (Duration): Varies by Film\r\n\r\nYear(s): 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2016.\r\n\r\nStarring: Ice Cube, Eve (the rapper), Cedric the Entertainer, Queen Latifah, etc...\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Comedy, Family, Drama.\r\n\r\nResolution: 720p\r\n\r\nRip Type (Source): Web-DL\r\n\r\nCodec Type: x264\r\n\r\nFormat of File(s): MP4(s).\r\n\r\nAudio Format &amp; Language(s): AC3 DD 5.1 (English).\r\n\r\nSubtitles: YES (for each film).\r\n\r\nChapters: Yes.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link(s): \r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303714/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337579/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388500/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3628584/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb3e71cf572a364f98dcbda6f6da8b501788412","amp;dn":"BARBERSHOP+1%2C2%3ABack+in+Business%2CBeauty+Shop%2CThe+Next+Cut+-+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb3e71cf572a364f98dcbda6f6da8b501788412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,179,231,28,245,114,163,100,249,141,203,218,111,109,168,181,1,120,132,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
