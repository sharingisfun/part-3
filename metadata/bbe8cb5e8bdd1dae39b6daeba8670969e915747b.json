But it's not true for all plants. Some things can be planted and eaten in weeks, days, even hours.\n\n\nThe Speedy Vegetable Garden highlights more than 50 quick crops, with complete information on how to sow, grow, and harvest each plant, and sumptuous photography that provides inspiration and a visual guide for when to harvest. In addition to instructions for growing, it also provides recipes that highlight each cropÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique flavor, like Chickpea sprout hummus, stuffed tempura zucchini flowers, and a paella featuring calendula.\n\n\nSprouted seeds are the fastest. Microgreens can be harvested in weeks: cilantro, 14 days after planting; arugula and fennel in 10 days. And a handful of vegetable varieties grow more quickly than their slower relatives, like dwarf French beans (60 days), cherry tomatoes (65 days), and early potatoes (75 days).\n\n\nThe Speedy Vegetable Garden puts fresh, seed-to-table food at your fingertips, fast!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbe8cb5e8bdd1dae39b6daeba8670969e915747b","amp;dn":"The+Speedy+Vegetable+Garden+2013+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbe8cb5e8bdd1dae39b6daeba8670969e915747b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,232,203,94,139,221,29,174,57,182,218,235,168,103,9,105,233,21,116,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
