This first track, reminiscent of the opening of Psalm 130 (traditionally recited by Jews in times of distress), attracted similar airplay to that of his previous singles.\n\nThe first and last tracks on the album feature the popular late Israeli singer Shoshana Damari.\n\nIn addition to more catchy tunes in Hebrew and Amharic, Raichel adds Arabic (in Azini), Tigrinya (in Siyaishaya Ingoma), Hindi (in Milim Yafot Me'ele), and Yemenite Hebrew to his linguistic repertoire.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.
