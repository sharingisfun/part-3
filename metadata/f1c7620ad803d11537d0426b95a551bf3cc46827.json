A near-fatal accident has left her temporarily wheelchair bound and depleted of her long-term memory. She is accompanied by her boyfriend 'Callum' whom she met whilst traveling. He was also the driver in the fateful accident. Not only has she forgotten her family, but her childhood as well and is surprised to discover that her home is a stately manor in the middle of the country-side. As January tries to settle in, she finds herself becoming even more estranged from her family, who just want their daughter back. The trouble is, she cannot remember who that daughter was, or why she ran away in the first place. Desperate to discover why she left all those years ago and with Callum's help, she sets out to find the truth. They soon discover the family are not as loving as they seem to be. Was there a dark reason why she left them in the first place?\r\n\r\nDirector: Adam Levins\r\nWriters: William Borthwick (original story), Simon Fantauzzo (original story)\r\nStars: Craig Conway, James Cosmo, Bob Duff\r\nGenres: Thriller\r\nCountry: UK\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: Estranged.2016.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO\r\n                                             \r\nSOURCE: iTunes - Thanks King-DVD!                                              \r\n\r\nViDEO: 2050 Kbps\r\n\r\nRESOLUTiON: 720x384 \r\n\r\nRUNTiME: 1h 28m 43s \r\n\r\nSUBTiTLES: No                             \r\n\r\nAUDiO: 192 Kbps AC3       \r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\nNOTES: Enjoy.\r\n\r\n SPECIAL THANKS TO: The Big Boss WIGWIG, ANSA, ACHOSINK,\r\n                 HAMADA, MAZENTBT, CD-Moonlight, EMPEROR_DVD.  \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8JG \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8JP \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8JX \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/a8Jg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1c7620ad803d11537d0426b95a551bf3cc46827","amp;dn":"Estranged.2016.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1c7620ad803d11537d0426b95a551bf3cc46827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,199,98,10,216,3,209,21,55,208,66,107,149,165,81,191,60,196,104,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
