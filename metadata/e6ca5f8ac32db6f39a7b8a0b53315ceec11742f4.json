Chomsky offers insights into the institutions that shape the public mind in the service of power and profit. In an interview conducted after the important November 1999 Â“Battle in Seattle,â€ Chomsky discusses prospects for building a movement to challenge corporate domination of the media, the environment, and even our private lives.
