It was released on September 28, 2010. On September 17, a five-track sampler was also made available for free. The film's score bears a similar sound to the previous Reznor/Ross 2008 collaboration, Ghosts I-IV, and even features two slightly reworked tracks from Ghosts. (The track &quot;Magnetic&quot; is reworked from &quot;14 Ghosts II&quot;, and &quot;A Familiar Taste&quot; is a remix of &quot;35 Ghosts IV&quot;.)\n\nCritical reception of the soundtrack has been generally favorable, with high praise and widespread acclaim across the film industry being bestowed upon it. The score won nine major awards, including the 2010 Golden Globe award for Best Original Score ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Motion Picture, and the Academy Award for Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a4411e8528996eeaa625d7368f1aa5991b39dd2","amp;dn":"The+Social+Network+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a4411e8528996eeaa625d7368f1aa5991b39dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,68,17,232,82,137,150,238,170,98,93,115,104,241,170,89,145,179,157,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
