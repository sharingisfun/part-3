Readers are guided step by step through specific problems and challenges, covering all aspects of electrostatics with an emphasis on numerical procedures. Focusing on practical examples, mathematical equations, and common issues with algorithms, this is an ideal text for students in engineering, physics, and electrostaticsÃ¢â‚¬â€and working engineers and physicists.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 438 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-IEEE Press; 1 edition (April 7, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1118449746\nISBN-13: 978-1118449745\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2b7e670b53d250dd2646aa5a722fc131444a672","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Numerical+Electrostatics+Using+MATLAB+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2b7e670b53d250dd2646aa5a722fc131444a672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,183,230,112,181,61,37,13,210,100,106,165,167,34,252,19,20,68,166,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
