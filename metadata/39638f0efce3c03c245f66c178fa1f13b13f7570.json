Quickly, John Wells is called in to investigate, but before he can get far, the tip comes true. Which means that the next warning the source gives will be taken very seriously indeed. And itâ€™s a big one.\r\n\r\nA radioactive one.\r\n\r\nAs the threat level jumps and the government mobilizes, Wells must figure out what's really going on. From a drug lord's mansion in Guatemala to a secret plastic surgery center in Thailand to the slums of Istanbul, Wells uses every skill he hasâ€”including his ability to go undercover in the Arab worldâ€”to chase down leads. But the enemy he faces is equally determined. And soon he may be too late to pull the United States back from the brink of war","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39638f0efce3c03c245f66c178fa1f13b13f7570","amp;dn":"THE+COUNTERFEIT+AGENT-8-Alex+Berenson.+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39638f0efce3c03c245f66c178fa1f13b13f7570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,99,143,14,252,227,192,60,36,95,102,193,120,250,31,19,177,63,117,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
