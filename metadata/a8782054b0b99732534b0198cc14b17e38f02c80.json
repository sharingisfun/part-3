Formed in 1998 in London, the group comprises vocalist/pianist/guitarist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion. Coldplay have been one of the most commercially successful acts of the new millennium, selling over 30 million albums. The band are also known for their hit singles, such as &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; and the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Clocks&quot;.\n\nColdplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of their single &quot;Yellow&quot;, followed by the success of their debut album, Parachutes (2000), which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Both Parachutes and its follow-up, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), were released to great critical acclaim and commercial success; the latter was named NME's Album of the Year. X&amp;Y (2005) met with a generally positive reception; and since December 2006, the band has been working with producer Brian Eno on their fourth studio album, entitled Viva la Vida, which will be released in June 2008.\n\nColdplay's early material was compared to acts such as Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, while also drawing comparisons to U2 and Travis. Since the release of Parachutes, Coldplay have also drawn influence from other sources, including Echo and the Bunnymen and George Harrison on A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) and Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for X&amp;Y (2005). Coldplay has been an active supporter of various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group has also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nAlbums:\n\n2008 - Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends (Japanese Retail) [FLAC]\n2005 - X&amp;Y (Japanese Special Edition) [FLAC]\n2002 - A Rush of Blood to the Head [FLAC]\n2000 - Parachutes (2CD Special Edition) [FLAC]\n\nEP's:\n\n2008 - Prospekt's March [FLAC]\n2005 - Sparks EP [FLAC]\n1999 - The Blue Room EP [FLAC]\n1999 - Brothers &amp; Sisters EP [FLAC]\n\nSingles:\n\n2008 - Viva La Vida (CDS) [FLAC]\n2008 - Violet Hill (CDS) [FLAC]\n2008 - Lost!
