Following the demise of an earlier, conspicuously synth pop-based outfit named Empire, the Hawkins brothers sowed the seeds of what would become the Darkness at an impromptu karaoke session on New Year's Eve 1999. Justin's rapturous rendition of Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; showed them the way, and the suitably dramatic name of the Darkness was chosen shortly after the arrival of Poullain and Graham.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.One Way Ticket\n02.Knockers\n03.Is It Just Me\n04.Dinner Lady Arms\n05.Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time\n06.Hazel Eyes\n07.Bald\n08.Girlfriend\n09.English Country Garden\n10.Blind Man\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766115b8adf8188a54e14b48455435fdacd0b9dd","amp;dn":"The+Darkness+-+One+Way+Ticket++To+Hell+and+Back+%282005%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766115b8adf8188a54e14b48455435fdacd0b9dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,97,21,184,173,248,24,138,84,225,75,72,69,84,53,253,172,208,185,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
