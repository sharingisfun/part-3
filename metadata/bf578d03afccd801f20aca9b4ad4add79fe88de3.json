The resulting album is a heartfelt set that showcases the 42-year-old singer and pianistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegant style. Heavily emotive tracks like Ã¢â‚¬ËœHope ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SomeoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœFor Today I Am a BoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shine in the intimate setting, but a real revelation comes in Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhere Is My PowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Previously released as a B-side, this live take scrubs away an ugly drumbeat and uncovers the song's natural beauty. Casual fans are unlikely to find anything new in most of these recordings but, 14 years into his career, Hegarty is still a startling performer and songwriter.
