As an author, Lauralee Sherwood is known for the most up-to-date and accurate coverage as well as strong pedagogy making the text the most effective learning tool. Plus, the program offers a complete complement of media tools for learning and teaching. Additionally, this new edition has an entirely revised art program offering realistic and three-dimensional art as well as new flow diagrams. The new art program helps students visualize difficult concepts and processes for better understanding and mastery of concepts.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 928 pages\n# Publisher: Brooks Cole; 7 edition (December 22, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0495391840\n# ISBN-13: 978-0495391845\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf172d83aae9d33944443494501e5cfb4cdc027c","amp;dn":"Human+Physiology-From+Cells+to+Systems%2C7th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf172d83aae9d33944443494501e5cfb4cdc027c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,23,45,131,170,233,211,57,68,68,52,148,80,30,92,251,76,220,2,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
