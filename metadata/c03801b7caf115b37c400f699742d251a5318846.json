Together these documents form the Book of Sith. Over the centuries, the texts were passed among Force users who left handwritten notes and annotations in the margins, including Darth Vader, Yoda, Mace Windu, and Luke Skywalker, among others.\n\nCollected by acclaimed Star Wars writer Daniel Wallace and embellished by numerous esteemed Star Wars illustrators, this volume introduces new characters and history, and delves deeper into understanding the philosophies and methods behind the dark side of the Force.\n\nHardcover: 160 pages\nPublisher: Chronicle Books (April 16, 2013)\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03801b7caf115b37c400f699742d251a5318846","amp;dn":"STAR+WARS+-+BOOK+OF+SITH+%282012%29+%28Chronicle%29+%28Minutemen-Syl3ntBob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03801b7caf115b37c400f699742d251a5318846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,56,1,183,202,241,21,179,124,64,15,105,151,66,210,81,165,49,136,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
