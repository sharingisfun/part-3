He continued to get commissions, but had to teach to make ends meet for a long time. Eventually, after a heart attack, he gave up his university post and devoted himself fulltime to composition once more. His symphonies date from this latter period. This release includes the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Symphonies. The performances are decent, the music far more so.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio of Toch is enclosed.
