Users only pay for what they use and can store and retrieve any amount of data at any time over the Internet, which attracts Hadoop users who run clusters on EC2.\n\nThe book starts by showing you how to install several AWS SDKs such as iOS, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby and shows you how to manage objects. Then, you'll be taught how to use the installed AWS SDKs to develop applications with Amazon S3. Furthermore, you will explore the Amazon S3 pricing model and will learn how to annotate S3 billing with cost allocation tagging. In addition to this, the book covers several practical recipes about how to distribute your content with CloudFront, secure your content with IAM, optimize Amazon S3 performance, and notify S3 events with Lambada","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c67c18a9ec3c1c4906e98ba6c58a174b9acf110","amp;dn":"Amazon+S3+Cookbook+%28DjShay12%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c67c18a9ec3c1c4906e98ba6c58a174b9acf110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,103,193,138,158,195,193,196,144,110,152,186,108,88,161,116,185,172,241,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
