Cleon Skousen - The Naked Communist - mobi [TKRG]\r\n\r\nTo date, The Naked Communist has sold almost two million copies and has found its way into the libraries of the CIA, the FBI, the White House, and homes all across the United States. In one clarifying and readable volume, the whole story of communism is graphically told and includes the tragic histories of China, Korea, Russia, the UN, Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley, General MacArthur, and others. National broadcaster Paul Harvey at CBS said, &quot;I have never given any volume such an unqualified endorsement.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Naked Communist contains a distillation of more than one hundred books and treatises on communism, many written by Marxist authors. This text that reviewers have called &quot;the most powerful book on communism since J. Edgar Hoover's Masters of Deceit&quot; sees the communist as he sees himself - stripped of propaganda and pretense. Readers are offered an explanation of the appeal of communism, its history, its basic and unchanging concepts - even its secret timetable of conquest.\r\n\r\nAmong the many questions it answers are:\r\n* Who gave the United States' nuclear secrets to the Russians?\r\n* How did the FBI fight communism after it was forced underground in 1918?\r\n* Why did the West lose 600 million allies after World War II?\r\n* What really happened in Korea?\r\n* What is communism's great secret weapon?\r\n* Is there an answer to communism?\r\n* What lies ahead?\r\n* What can I do to stop communism?\r\n* How can we stop communism without a major war?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbe7ea3d1ed2a1f0b6774d6c7250360131a8c8f0","amp;dn":"W.+Cleon+Skousen+-+The+Naked+Communist+-+mobi+%5BTKRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbe7ea3d1ed2a1f0b6774d6c7250360131a8c8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,231,234,61,30,210,161,240,182,119,77,108,114,80,54,1,49,168,200,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
