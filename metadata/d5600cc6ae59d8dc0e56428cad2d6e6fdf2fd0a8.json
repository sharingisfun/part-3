Across 46 tracks, however, The Whole Story does hit every necessary highlight and, if Cliff Richard's career can be summed up by his Top Five hits alone, then this set is a more practical lesson than any of the anthologies that likewise claim to document his five decades of success. From &quot;Move It&quot; to &quot;The Millennium Prayer,&quot; all of Richard's most memorable numbers are included here, in sharp chronological order and so smoothly arranged that, although the 1960s do take the lion's share of the track listing, the decades that followed get a fair look in as well. There are no surprises here, and no inclusions (or omissions) that you can really argue with. Quite simply, it's the perfect one-stop for anybody who wants a solid selection of Richard's biggest smashes -- and, if you find yourself needing more, then the six-CD Singles box is the only thing that tells the same story better.\nAll Music Review by Dave Thompson.\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Move It\n[02] Living Doll\n[03] Travellin' Light\n[04] Please Don't Tease\n[05] I Love You\n[06] The Young Ones\n[07] It'll Be Me\n[08] Do You Wanna Dance\n[09] The Next Time\n[10] Bachelor Boy\n[11] Summer Holiday\n[12] It's All In The Game\n[13] Don't Talk To Him\n[14] Constantly\n[15] On The Beach\n[16] I Could Easily Fall\n[17] The Minute You're Gone\n[18] Visions\n[19] In The Country\n[20] The Day I Met Marie\n[21] Power To All Our Friends\n[22] Miss You Nights\n[23] Devil Woman\n[24] My Kinda Life\n[25] We Dont Talk Anymore\n[26] Carrie\n[27] Dreamin'\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:17m:50s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Wired For Sound\n[02] Daddy's Home\n[03] The Only Way Out\n[04] True Love Ways\n[05] Please Don't Fall In Love\n[06] She's So Beautiful\n[07] My Pretty One\n[08] Some People\n[09] Mistletoe &amp; Wine\n[10] The Best Of Me\n[11] I Just Don't Have The Heart\n[12] Silhouettes\n[13] From A Distance\n[14] Saviour's Day\n[15] I Still Believe In You\n[16] Peace In Our Time\n[17] Be With Me Always\n[18] Can't Keep This Feeling In\n[19] The Millennium Prayer\n\nCD02 Play Time - 01h:15m12:s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:33m:04s\nTotal File Size....................... 360mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
