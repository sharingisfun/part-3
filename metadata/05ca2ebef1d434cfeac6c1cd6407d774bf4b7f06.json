Although new to the American public, Swift had been performing since her preteen years in Wyomissing, PA, where she first took the stage as part of a children's theater troupe. Encouraged by the troupe's manager to pursue music instead, Swift began performing karaoke songs at a local mall, with open-mike gigs following shortly thereafter. She sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before a Philadelphia 76ers game at the age of 11; the following year, she began practicing the guitar several hours each day, modeling her early songwriting attempts on crossover artists like Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks. Swift's parents realized her dedication and began making regular visits to Nashville, TN, where Swift could perform casually and meet with songwriters in the area. The family then decided to move to an outlying Nashville suburb, which accelerated Swift's career. \n\n\n\n+---------------+\n| Studio Albums |\n+---------------+\n\nTaylor Swift (2006)\nFearless (International Edition) (2009)\nSpeak Now (Deluxe Version) (2010)\n\n\n\n-------[Group Notes]----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso included are all digital booklets in all of her albums.\n\n\n\n\n+----------+\n| Settings |\n+----------+\n\n\nGenre: Country\nCopyright: theLEAK\nEncoded by: theLEAK\nBit Rate: 320 kbps\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ca2ebef1d434cfeac6c1cd6407d774bf4b7f06","amp;dn":"Taylor+Swift+Discography+%28iTunes+Edition%29+%5BtheLEAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ca2ebef1d434cfeac6c1cd6407d774bf4b7f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,202,46,190,241,212,52,207,234,198,193,205,100,7,215,116,191,75,127,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
