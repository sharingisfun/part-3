On a rainy April morning, she is reading auras at Spiritual Palms when Susan Burke walks in. A keen observer of human behavior, our unnamed narrator immediately diagnoses beautiful, rich Susan as an unhappy woman eager to give her lovely life a drama injection; however, when the &quot;psychic&quot; visits the eerie Victorian home that has been the source of Susanâ€™s terror and grief, she realizes she may not have to pretend to believe in ghosts anymore. Miles, Susanâ€™s teenage stepson, doesnâ€™t help matters with his disturbing manner and grisly imagination. The three are soon locked in a chilling battle to discover where the evil truly lurks and what, if anything, can be done to escape it. \r\n\r\nâ€œThe Grownup,â€ which originally appeared as â€œWhat Do You Do?â€ in George R. R. Martinâ€™s Rogues anthology, proves once again that Gillian Flynn is one of the worldâ€™s most original and skilled voices in fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cbcd3e126cd5636c6d30e8aa56df21089d608a6","amp;dn":"The+Grownup+-+Gillian+Flynn+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cbcd3e126cd5636c6d30e8aa56df21089d608a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,188,211,225,38,205,86,54,198,211,14,138,165,109,242,16,137,214,8,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
