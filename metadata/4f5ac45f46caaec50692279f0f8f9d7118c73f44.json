The poetic touch of Tarkovsky's hand and his measured pace is already evident as the tale of the young, twelve-year-old Ivan (Nikolai Burlyayev) evolves. Ivan is orphaned after his village is wiped out by an invading Nazi army and as a consequence, he ends up in a prison camp. The inventive lad escapes and is adopted by Captain Kholin (Valentin Zubkov), whose intention is to send the boy away to school. But Ivan is determined to help the Russian army and so he starts spying on the German forces. Because of his tender years he manages to pass freely back and forth behind enemy lines -- at least for awhile. This exemplary film won the top prize, the Golden Lion award at the 1962 Venice Film Festival and also won the Grand Prize at the 1962 San Francisco Film Festival. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Ivanovo Detstvo-1962-Andrei Tarkovsky.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.45 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 2176 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 6.08 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 1980 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.268\n      StreamSize : 1.32 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 35mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 130 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0056111\n\nRussian audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nCriterion rip by rulle, posted at Secret-Cinema by danbailan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f5ac45f46caaec50692279f0f8f9d7118c73f44","amp;dn":"Ivanovo+Detstvo-1962-Andrei+Tarkovsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f5ac45f46caaec50692279f0f8f9d7118c73f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,90,196,95,70,202,174,197,6,146,39,159,15,143,157,113,24,199,63,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
