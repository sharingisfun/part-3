This 1942 remake improves on the original, especially in replacing the stolid Raft with the charismatic Alan Ladd.\nBrian Donlevy essays the role of the boss, who is determined to back reform candidate Moroni Olsen, despite Ladd's gut feeling that this move is a mistake. Ladd knows that Donlevy is doing a political about-face merely to get in solid with Olsen's pretty daughter Veronica Lake. It is Ladd who is left to clean up the mess when crime lord Joseph Calleila murders Olsen's wastrel son Richard Denning and pins the rap on Donlevy. As Ladd struggles to clear Donlevy's name, he falls in love with LakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½when he's not being pummeled about by Calleila's psychopathic henchman William Bendix.\nFar less complex than the Dashiel Hammett original (and far less damning of the American political system), The Glass Key further increased the box-office pull of Paramount's new team of Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Glass Key.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 700 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 23mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 176 Kbps\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 23mn\n      Bit rate : 1 105 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 432 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.178\n      Stream size : 657 MiB (94%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 23mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 58.3 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 34.7 MiB (5%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 526 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 16.5 --abr 64\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034798/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034798/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nCredits to Ursuletz, at Karagarga","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf1ce52ca80982d468704b3fd571bce83181743","amp;dn":"The+Glass+Key+%5B1942%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf1ce52ca80982d468704b3fd571bce83181743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,241,206,82,202,128,152,45,70,135,4,179,253,87,27,206,131,24,23,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
