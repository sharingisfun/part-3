She has published seven autobiographies, five books of essays, and several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning more than fifty years.  She has received over thirty honorary doctoral degrees and dozens of awards, including the National Medal of Arts (2000), the Lincoln Medal (2008), and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2011).\n\nAngelou is best known for her series of critically-acclaimed autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences.

The first, I KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS (1969), which was nominated for a National Book Award, tells of her life up to the age of seventeen, and brought her international recognition and acclaim.\n\nShe is also an established poet, although her poems have received mixed reviews.
