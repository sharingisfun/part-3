Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes.\n\nIn another part of town, months later, a retired cop named Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved crime. When he gets a crazed letter from someone who self-identifies as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“perkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and threatens an even more diabolical attack, Hodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing another tragedy.\n\nBrady Hartsfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again. Only Bill Hodges, with a couple of highly unlikely allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again. And they have no time to lose, because BradyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim thousands.\n\nMr. Mercedes is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable.\n\n**\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nKingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interest in crime fiction was evident from his work for the Hard Case Crime imprintÃ¢â‚¬â€The Colorado Kid (2005) and Joyland (2013)Ã¢â‚¬â€but this is the most straight-up mystery-thriller of his career. Retired Detective Bill Hodges is overweight, directionless, and toying with the idea of ending it all when he receives a jeering letter from the Mercedes Killer, who ran down 23 people with a stolen car but evaded HodgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ capture. With the help of a 17-year-old neighbor and one victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister (who, in proper gumshoe style, Hodges quickly beds), Hodges begins to play cat-and-mouse with the killer through a chat site called Under DebbieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blue Umbrella. HodgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ POV alternates with that of the troubled murderer, a Norman BatesÃ¢â‚¬â€œlike ice-cream-truck driver named Brady Hartfield. Both Hodges and Hartfield make mistakes, big ones, leaving this a compelling, small-scale slugfest that plays out in cheery suburban settings. This exists outside of the usual Kingverse (Pennywise the Clown is referred to as fictive); add that to the atypical present-tense prose, and this feels pretty darn fresh. Big, smashing climax, too. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: No need to rev the engine here; this baby will rocket itself out of libraries with a loud squeal of the tires. --Daniel Kraus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a8a56100cc64cdbdf865003d517feca13ded386","amp;dn":"Mr.+Mercedes+-+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a8a56100cc64cdbdf865003d517feca13ded386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,138,86,16,12,198,76,219,223,134,80,3,213,23,254,202,19,222,211,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
