He's actually going there to debunk these activities but finds on \r\narrival that his collaborator, Professor Henry Harrington, has died in a \r\nstrange accident. Harrington's niece Joanna isn't so quick to dismiss \r\nparanormal activity and believes that the subject of their investigation, \r\nDr. Julian Karswell, had placed a Runic curse on her uncle. Unable to get \r\ncertain book from the British Museum, Holden accepts Karswell's offer to \r\nvisit him and borrow his own copy. There he learns that Karswell was once \r\na magician, which fits in well with his view that paranormal activity is \r\njust so much hocus pocus. Soon after he and Joanna return to London, he \r\nfinds that Karswell has place a similar curse among his own papers. Slowly, \r\nHolden comes to realize that the dangers are very real and he must find a \r\nway to rid himself of the death sentence that has been placed on him.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Dana Andrews.\r\n=&gt;-Niall MacGinnis.\r\n=&gt;-Peggy Cummins.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Jacques Tourneur.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre.........................: Horror : Mystery : Suspense : Sci-Fi : Classic.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date..................: 1957.\r\n=&gt;-Language......................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size.....................: 1.20 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate..............: 1 800 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime.................: 1 h 35mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters......................: 12.\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec.........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio..................: 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution....................: 1280 x 720.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate......................: 1 666 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 1 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec.........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels......................: 2 channel.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate......................: 128 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate..............: 238 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dfc5a47058ef2f2542057186ebdada3e8449b3a","amp;dn":"Night+Of+The+Demon+-+Horror+1957+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dfc5a47058ef2f2542057186ebdada3e8449b3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,252,90,71,5,142,242,242,84,32,87,24,110,189,173,163,232,68,155,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
