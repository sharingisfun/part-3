But it afso bears testimony to the sophisticated consciousness, wisdom and Afrocentric worldview that were the trademarks of the Rasta rebel soul at that time. This music had weight.\r\nThat 'Roots' and 'Culture' became pilloried cliches at the\tbeginning of the 80s says something about the rot that had set in\tat the heart of reggae - and just as much about, how times had changed. The idea of Roots - kind of personified by Alex Haley's mid-Seventies book and TV series of the same period - typified the search for an African identity, after centuries of physical and then economic slavery, amongst Jamaican youth.\r\nSince the dawning of the rastafarian movement, since the 1920s and Marcus Garvey and other great clarion voices call for repatriation, since the groundbreaking visit of Ethiopia's fable king of kings, lord of lords His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie to Jamaica in the late 60s, sinca these times, a vision of world order, shaped by remnants of colonial Christianity. African-derived history and mysticism, and honed by the everyday experience of impoverished youth in the Kingston ghettos, had evolved.\r\nThis new voice burst out of the ghettos and rattled the coffee cups throughout Jamaica's middle and ruling classes. When through the network of ex-pats and their children this voice began to make its presence felt 'inna Babylon' (Rastafarian biblical lingo for the western industrialised countries, and especially Britain and the USA), the rebel youth with their spidery dreadlocks, 'Natty Dread' style, clouds of ganja smoke and roots of reggae consciousness were in a position of unprecedented political power.

There's alot of bad, copy cat reggae out there with no soul. This is pure old school roots, before the bad stuff was even heard of. Classic reggae flows and gives you a peaceful sence that this is the way life should be. This is one of the best cd's I've purchased. If you like reggae, get this cd! You won't regret it!!
