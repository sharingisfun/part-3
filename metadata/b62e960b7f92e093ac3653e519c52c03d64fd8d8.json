After such a lengthy break, most critics would suggest that no album could match the anticipation, (looking at you, Tool). IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be honest; because of the huge gap between albums, my interest had waned a little, so much so that I wasn't even aware of the upcoming album until about a month before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s released. Shame on me, I know.\nimage\nIt is now January, in 2015 and the new album, Captivity &amp; Devourment is upon us and Armageddon invite you to step into dystopiaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFirst things first, WOW. Armageddon have never sounded this good, this fresh, this angry! Right out of the gate the album bashes the listener with the lengthy title track. Blast Beats and all. What struck me was how Ã¢â‚¬ËœproggyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ this all sounds (albeit an overused, trite term these days). The most Ã¢â‚¬ËœstraightforwardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ track on offer here is Ã¢â‚¬ËœFugitive DustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and if pushed, I would pick this as my favourite of the bunch. Think, In Flames, at their VERY best, and you will be somewhat close to imagining the quality on offer here.\n\nThe band, led by the legendary Christopher Amott, sounds completely revitalised and I can only assume that this is due the thirteen year break. Another explanation could be the wholly overhauled list of band members; (Chris Amott being the only original member), however, it is not known what role the new members played in the creative process. Whether or not they did contribute to the writing, this can be said, they play extremely tight as a unit and with great chemistry. Vocalist Matt Hallquist is quite versatile to say the least, with contrasting tones between the crushing track, Ã¢â‚¬ËœRenditionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the first single, Ã¢â‚¬ËœFugitive DustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nOne thing you can always rely on when Christopher Amott is on board is emotive and well thought out guitar solos. You only have to look at the track Ã¢â‚¬ËœEqualizerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the unusual but engaging instrumental, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBackground RadiationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to realise that this album is no exception.\n\nCaptivity &amp; Devourment is a masterpiece of death metal that will remind you why you fell in love with the genre in the first place. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fresh, complex and effecting and it has already reserved itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place in the top albums to be released this year. And what a year it has already been for metal releases!\n\nimage\n\n\nQuote:\nArmageddon, led by former Arch Enemy guitarist Christopher Amott, have signed with Listenable Records.\n\nAmott states: &quot;Armageddon are happy to announce that we've signed a deal with Listenable Records. Our new album, Captivity &amp; Devourment, is set for a worldwide release on January 26th, 2015. Me and head of label Laurent Merle go way back and I'm looking forward to working alongside him and his staff to make Armageddon the absolute best it can be. Thank you all! See you on the road in 2015.&quot;\n\nArmageddon first came to life in Sweden in 1997 as a studio project, with cult album Crossing The Rubicon, a sci-fi themed concept album. Two more albums followed, Embrace The Mystery in 2000 and Three in 2003, both featuring different line-ups and different musical directions, Christopher Amott being the sole original member.\n\nArmageddon is now resurrected in its most powerful form. The band is based out of New York City, and has brought unto itself a crushing lineup of musicians. Together they have once again conjured up the force that is Armageddon.\n\nThe new album, Captivity &amp; Devourment, consists of 10 awe-inspiring and ingeniously crafted songs, full of devastating riffs, soaring guitar leads and fist pumping choruses. Heavy, melodic, technical, and groovy: this is creative metal songwriting with one foot in deep in the classics and and one eye gazing towards the distant future.\n\n\nArmageddon lineup:\n\nMatt Hallquist - Lead vocals\nChristopher Amott - Guitars and clean vocals\nJoey Concepcion - Guitars\nSara Claudius - Bass\nMÃƒÂ¡rton Veress - Drums\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
