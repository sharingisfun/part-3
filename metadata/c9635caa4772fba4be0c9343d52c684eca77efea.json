Combine this with the \n\ndefinitions in the United States Code, and you're well on your way to figuring out what's really going on.\n\nThese are all PDF versions.  Only the 8th and 9th editions are searchable where text is recognize, all others are \n\nscanned images.\n\nHave fun and share!\n\n=========================================================================================\n\n1st Edition - 871 pages  - Published 1891\n2nd Edition - 1322 pages - Published 1910\n3rd Edition - 1952 pages - Published 1933\n4th Edition - 1956 pages - Published 1968\n5th Edition - 1525 pages - Published 1979\n6th Edition - 1663 pages - Published 1990\n7th Edition - 1788 pages - Published 1999\n8th Edition - 5426 pages - Published 2004\n9th Edition - 1943 pages - Published 2009\n\n=========================================================================================\n\nIn law, a law dictionary is known as a secondary authority in law. \n\n&quot;A secondary authority is an authority purporting to explain the meaning or applicability of the actual verbatim texts \n\nof primary authorities; such as constitutions, statutes, case law, administrative regulations, executive orders, \n\ntreaties, or similar legal instruments. Some secondary authority materials are written and published by governments to \n\nexplain the laws in simple, non-technical terms, while other secondary authority materials are written and published \n\nby private companies, non-profit organizations, or other groups or individuals.&quot; \n\nBlack's Law Dictionary is one of those secondary authority in law.\n\n\nThe 5th edition is reportedly the edition modern day judges use in American court houses, which are really merchant \n\ntribunals based upon how they operate today. Courts are measures and machines for collecting cash for governments \n\nnowadays. You see this all time pertaining to traffic cases. However, this is not the fault of judges, the court \n\nsystem, politicians,or government in my opinion.\n\nIt is the fault largely due to the American people who have become so fearful,lazy, and ignorant pertaining to their \n\nrights and the duties of their governing bodies and officials, so much so that their elected officials tell them what \n\nto do despite the people paying the elected officials via their tax dollars.\n\nEmployers (American people) are supposed to telltheir employees (government officials) what to do, but no longer with \n\nAmerican citizens.  Americans, generally speaking, have been successfully dumb downed! People fear government instead \n\nof government fearing people. This was the slogan of the movie &quot;V For Vendetta&quot;.\n\nThe 5th edition was the last edition to contain case-decisional law orlegal precedent.  All editions after the 5th \n\nedition - the 6th, 7th, 8th, and now 9th, do not contain case-decisional law or legal precedent.\n\n\n[from 1215.org]\nHowever, Black's Law Dictionary, 5th through 7th Editions are not as accurate because references to common law are \n\nprogressively removed, and Roman Civil Law concepts are augmented in order to conform to the law enforcement needs of \n\npolitical power centers such as the Federal Government and the United Nations. \n\nThe rule of thumb is that older dictionaries are useful for understanding natural rights, common law, personal \n\nsovereignty, and the people's point of view. Newer dictionaries are useful for understanding civil rights, Roman civil \n\nlaw, centralized authority, and the government's point of view. All attorneys are trained in the latter. Judges may go \n\nto special seminars to learn the former. \n\n=========================================================================================\n\n\nInteresting Notes:\n\nThe properly and completely defined the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“United StatesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was removed from the 7th Edition of the same dictionary \n\nby the publisher (possibly in an apparent effort to further conceal the truth about the limited jurisdiction of our \n\nfederal government).\n\nThe properly and completely defined term &quot;Marriage License&quot; has been removed from the 6th Edition and up.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9635caa4772fba4be0c9343d52c684eca77efea","amp;dn":"Black%27s+Law+Dictionary+-+Editions+1-9+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9635caa4772fba4be0c9343d52c684eca77efea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,99,92,170,71,114,251,164,190,12,147,67,213,44,104,78,202,119,239,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
