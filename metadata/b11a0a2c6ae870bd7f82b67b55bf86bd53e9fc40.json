She has plans. Big ones. And a ton of ambition. One of those is going to get her killed one day - but not just yet.\n\nNot when she just got a job on a tiny trade ship with a nasty reputation for surprises. The Glorious Fool isn't misnamed: it likes to get into trouble. And with a reputation for bad luck that makes one year as security detail on this ship equal to five years everywhere else - Devi knows she's found the perfect way to get the jump on the next part of her Plan. But the Fool doesn't give up its secrets without a fight, and one year might be more than even Devi can handle.\nGenre: Science Fiction, Adventure\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11a0a2c6ae870bd7f82b67b55bf86bd53e9fc40","amp;dn":"Fortune%27s+Pawn_+Book+1+of+Paradox+-+Bach%2C+Rachel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11a0a2c6ae870bd7f82b67b55bf86bd53e9fc40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,26,10,44,106,232,112,189,127,130,182,123,85,191,134,189,83,233,252,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
