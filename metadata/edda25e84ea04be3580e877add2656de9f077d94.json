I have done this as a special request since I do not play on a mac and therefore cannot test these. I do not take credit for these customs as I am not the maker of any of them. I am simply making them available to people so that they don't have to download every single song on their own(Very time consuming process). As always these customs come from the folks over at smithyanvil forums so all credit goes to the people over there. All songs have had their appID's changed to cherub rock so you must own that song in order to play these customs. \n\nInstall instructions\n\nUnrar file\ncopy contents ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Rocksmith2014/dlc/&quot; ,\n\nYou might need to use &quot;Command-Shift-G&quot; to go inside ~/Library since it's hidden by default in the finder;\n\n\nOnce again I do not play on a mac so I do not know if these work or not.
