One night, she stumbles across the body of a Civil War reenactor, the second murdered in two days. Charlie is shocked to learn that her fatherâ€”a guide on the Journey, a historic paddle wheeler thatâ€™s sponsoring the reenactmentâ€”is a suspect.\r\nMeanwhile, Ethan Delaney, new to the FBIâ€™s Krewe of Hunters, is brought in on the case. He and Charlie have a history of their own, dating back to when he rescued her from a graveyardâ€”led there by a Confederate ghost!\r\nCharlie arranges a Mississippi River cruise so she and Ethan can get close to the reenactors, find out who knows what, who has a motive. They discover a lot more as they resume the relationship that ended ten years agoâ€¦but might die, along with them, on the Journey.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6006f26f303c629db1e0b572cd6c613a0e1e6071","amp;dn":"Darkest+Journey+-+Heather+Graham+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6006f26f303c629db1e0b572cd6c613a0e1e6071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,6,242,111,48,60,98,157,177,224,181,114,205,108,97,58,14,30,96,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
