In a small IT department, each person takes on many Ã¢â‚¬â€ if not all Ã¢â‚¬â€ of the processes and manages them individually. But in a big department, the processes need to be shared among job roles, standardized, and managed for maximum efficiency.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and IT Service Management (ITSM) are all about Ã¢â‚¬â€ managing the processes within an IT department to make the department run well and to make sure resources are available as needed. This certification and skill set are valuable to medium and large companies because it helps them get the most of their IT investment Ã¢â‚¬â€ both in the technology and in the people.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d6156fad8c7f964541b3e3dd7bdc188e54d5d76","amp;dn":"CBT+nuggets+ITIL+V3+foundations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d6156fad8c7f964541b3e3dd7bdc188e54d5d76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,97,86,250,216,199,249,100,84,27,62,61,215,189,193,136,229,77,93,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
