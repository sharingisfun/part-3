While the comparisons were apt at the time, &quot;Kiss with a Fist&quot; turned out to be a red herring in the wake of the release of Lungs, one of the most musically mature and emotionally mesmerizing albums of 2009. With an arsenal of weaponry that included the daring musicality of Kate Bush, the fearless delivery of SinÃƒÂ©ad O'Connor, and the dark, unhinged vulnerability of Fiona Apple, the London native crafted a debut that not only lived up to the machine-gun spray of buzz that heralded her arrival, but easily surpassed it. Like Kate Bush, Welch has little interest (for the most part) in traditional pop structures, and her songs are at their best when they see something sparkle in the woods and veer off of the main trail in pursuit. &quot;Kiss with a Fist,&quot; as good as it is, pales in comparison to standout cuts like &quot;Dog Days Are Over,&quot; &quot;Hurricane Drunk,&quot; &quot;Drumming Song,&quot; &quot;Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Love,&quot; all of which are anchored to the earth by Welch's knockout voice, a truly impressive and intuitive trio of producers, and a backing band that sounds as intimate with the material as its creator. [Lungs was also released in a Deluxe Edition that included Lungs: The B-Sides, a bonus disc featuring studio tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Swimming,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Falling,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Heavy in Your Arms,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the latter of which appeared on the soundtrack for Twilight Saga: Eclipse, as well as live cuts (Ã¢â‚¬Å“You've Got the Dirtee Love&quot;), demos (Ã¢â‚¬Å“GhostsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and remixes (the &quot;Yeasayer Remix&quot; of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dog Days Are Over&quot;).]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e53e328c545ce58bef009c6aefd407c9e9136602","amp;dn":"Florence+And+The+Machine+-+Lungs+%282009%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e53e328c545ce58bef009c6aefd407c9e9136602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,62,50,140,84,92,229,139,239,0,156,106,239,212,7,201,233,19,102,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
