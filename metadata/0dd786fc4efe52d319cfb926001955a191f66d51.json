But the band had a lengthy history prior to its international breakthrough, dating all the way back to the late '60s. They hit the big time in Jamaica during the '70s as a danceable yet rootsy Rastafarian reggae outfit, fronted by the charismatic singer Jacob Miller. Miller's tragic death in a car accident in 1980 put the group on hiatus for several years, and when they finally regrouped in the mid-'80s, they began to temper their rootsiness with elements of pop, R&amp;B, and dancehall. Originally recorded in 1987, &quot;Bad Boys&quot; became a worldwide smash in the early '90s, and the group soldiered on into the new millennium amid several personnel changes. \n\n\nGenre................: Reggae\nYear.................: 2004\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n01.Sweat (A La La La La Long) 2004 (Feat.
