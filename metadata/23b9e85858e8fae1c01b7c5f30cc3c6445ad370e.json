The series begins by explaining the workings of a single brain cell - the neuron - and then progresses to more sophisticated communication structures including how two neurons communicate with each other, how clusters of neurons carry out complex operations, and how such operations influence organs and glands throughout the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nextracted audio is also included in a separate folder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b9e85858e8fae1c01b7c5f30cc3c6445ad370e","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Biology+and+Human+Behavior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23b9e85858e8fae1c01b7c5f30cc3c6445ad370e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,185,232,88,88,232,250,225,192,27,124,95,48,204,60,100,69,173,55,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
