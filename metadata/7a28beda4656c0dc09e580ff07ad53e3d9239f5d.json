The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936.\n\nThe emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls togetherÃ¢â‚¬â€a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism.\n\nDrawing on the boysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of timesÃ¢â‚¬â€the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's The Amateurs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a28beda4656c0dc09e580ff07ad53e3d9239f5d","amp;dn":"THE+BOYS+IN+THE+BOAT+-+Daniel+James+Brown.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a28beda4656c0dc09e580ff07ad53e3d9239f5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,40,190,218,70,86,192,220,9,229,128,255,7,173,83,227,217,35,159,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
