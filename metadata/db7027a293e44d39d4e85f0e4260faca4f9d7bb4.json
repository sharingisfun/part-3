In the process, he presents a fascinating new look at the unique characteristics of our species and our society that helped propel us from stone tools to written language and through the birth of chemistry, biology, and modern physics to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technological world.\n\n Along the way he explores the cultural conditions that influenced scientific thought through the ages and the colorful personalities of some of the great philosophers, scientists, and thinkers: Galileo, who preferred painting and poetry to medicine and dropped out of university; Isaac Newton, who stuck needlelike bodkins into his eyes to better understand changes in light and color; and Antoine Lavoisier, who drank nothing but milk for two weeks to examine its effects on his body. Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and many lesser-known but equally brilliant minds also populate these pages, each of their stories showing how much of human achievement can be attributed to the stubborn pursuit of simple questions (why? how?), bravely asked.\n\n The Upright Thinkers is a book for science lovers and for anyone interested in creative thinking and in our ongoing quest to understand our world. At once deeply informed, accessible, and infused with the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark wit, this insightful work is a stunning tribute to humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intellectual curiosity.\n\n (With black-and-white illustrations throughout.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db7027a293e44d39d4e85f0e4260faca4f9d7bb4","amp;dn":"The+Upright+Thinkers%3A+The+Human+Journey+%282015%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db7027a293e44d39d4e85f0e4260faca4f9d7bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,112,39,162,147,228,77,57,212,232,95,14,66,96,250,202,79,157,123,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
