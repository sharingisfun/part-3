Presenting cutting-edge theory, research and case studies investigating Web 2.0 applications and tools that transform the role and behaviour of the new generation of travellers, this book also examines the ways in which tourism organisations reengineer and implement their business models and operations, such as new service development, marketing, networking and knowledge management. Written by an international group of researchers widely known for their expertise in the field of the Internet and tourism, chapters include applications and case studies in various travel, tourism and leisure sectors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46bee3b5d02753db252d76ddde8e231bff88297f","amp;dn":"Social+Media+in+Travel%2C+Tourism+and+Hospitality+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46bee3b5d02753db252d76ddde8e231bff88297f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,190,227,181,208,39,83,219,37,45,118,221,222,142,35,27,255,136,41,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
