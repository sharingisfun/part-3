It was refreshing to me to see black people portrayed as successful professionals.I loved the story and being able to follow the characters.t connected with people on so many levels not just the African American audience. People black or white will always go out and support great quality movies. I hear a lot of people bringing up color in discussions about this movie. The truth is I did go to see the movie because it was an all black cast. I also went because I knew the actors involved were serious about their craft. At the end of the day the only color that matters is green, and they deserve the green for a job well done. I can't wait until the DVD comes out! To everyone that made this film happen: thank you for fighting for quality movie despite the obstacles and lack of funds compared to other movies that came out ....\n\n\n\npretty ok copy low sounds one or two walk thrus take it or wait............\n\n\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS.........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a47508fee6f35e292fb9cc2c97df71055508e7f2","amp;dn":"The+Best+Man+Holiday+%28cam%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a47508fee6f35e292fb9cc2c97df71055508e7f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,117,8,254,230,243,94,41,47,185,204,44,151,223,113,5,85,8,231,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
