Moving forward with new technologies, the new Logic Pro X is a modern, 64-bit only application, which means that older 32-bit plug-ins will no longer work in Logic Pro X. Previous projects that were created in Logic 9 or earlier that include 32-bit only plug-ins will not fully open in Logic Pro X.\n\nEnter 32 Lives.\n\n32 Lives is a new application, capable of generating 64-bit Audio Units versions of your loved and hard-earned 32-bit legacy plug-ins, helping you to cross over to the new Logic Pro X smoothly and transparently. Older Logic 9 sessions will completely load into Logic Pro X, including all presets, parameters and automation. No special re-wiring or routing is required. All your 32-bit only plug-ins will again re-appear in the plug-ins menu as they always did. \n\nGeneral bug fixes\n- Fixed problem with plugins which have several version available simultaneously.\n- Fixed crash with URS plug-ins when writing automation.\n- Fixed Destroy FX Buffer Override tempo sync not working.\n- Fixed crash with IK Multimedia plug-ins in case the authorization wizard is left open for more than one minute.\n- Fixed DAW hang caused by IK MultimediaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authorization wizard window being hidden behind the DAW window; such hidden windows are now correctly brought forward.\n- Fixed crash with Arturia Analog Factory in Live.\n- Fixed most Pluggo validation crashes.\n- Fixed Abbey Road plug-ins UI not being refreshed after loading a preset.\n- Fixed some plug-ins failing to open due to component flags mismatches.\n- Fixed resurrected plug-in crashing in case the original 32-bit plug-in has been removed. Instead, the plug-in just fails to open.\n- Fixed memory leaks.\n\nGUI fixes and improvements\n- Added support for multiple screens.\n- Added support for plug-in windows resizing.\n- Improved Digital Performer plug-in windows behavior - windows get Ã¢â‚¬Å“out of the wayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when appropriate.\n- Fixed plug-in windows sometimes detaching from frame.\n- Fixed scenario where a plug-in window could be incorrectly hidden after clicking on it, in case a different applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s window overlaps with it.\n- Fixed other applicationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ invisible windows hiding plug-in windows.\n\nResurrection fixes and impovements\n- Enabled resurrection of Novation Automap and Longcat H3D.\n- Installer automatically updates previously resurrected plug-ins - no need to manually re-resurrect after installation.\n- Fixed 32 Lives manager crash when scanning components which do not contain Audio Units.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthepiratebay.se - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (05).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b0f1281fe01c05311861f7f6eb93e685bb79fe8","amp;dn":"Sound+Radix+-+32+Lives+v1.0.4+-+OS+X+-+CORE+Keygen+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b0f1281fe01c05311861f7f6eb93e685bb79fe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,15,18,129,254,1,192,83,17,134,31,127,110,185,62,104,91,183,159,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
