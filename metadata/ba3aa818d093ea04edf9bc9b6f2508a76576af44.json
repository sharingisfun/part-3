Its cabin can be arranged for 6-8 passengers. The longer-range Model 36 has a shortened passenger area to provide more space in the aft fuselage for fuel tanks.\r\nThe engines are mounted nacelles on the sides of the aft fuselage. The wings are equipped with single-slotted flaps. The wingtip fuel tanks distinguish the design from other aircraft having similar functions.\r\nThe Model 35A is an upgraded Model 35 with TFE731-2-2B engines and a range of 2,789 miles, with a fuel capacity of 931 US gallons (3,524 L) with refueling accomplished at ground level through each wingtip tank. It was introduced in 1976, replacing the 35. Over 600 35As were built, with a production line that ended in 1993","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba3aa818d093ea04edf9bc9b6f2508a76576af44","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+FlySimWare+LearJet+35A+v.2.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba3aa818d093ea04edf9bc9b6f2508a76576af44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,58,168,24,208,147,234,4,237,249,188,155,111,37,8,167,101,118,175,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
