Formerly of the group are Widespread Panic guitarist Jimmy Herring and former Black Crowes guitarist Audley Freed.\n\n'You can see this as a player's band, explains co-founder Steve Gorman, who also co-founded The Black Crowes, 'but it really is a band, in the true sense of that word.' Vocals are shared by multi-platinum singer Joan Osborne and veteran recording artist Jackie Greene. Rounding out the band are lead guitarist Tom Bukovac and bassist Nick Govrik, who wrote many of the band's songs. The Nashville-based quintet's debut album on Rounder Records draws on the strengths of all five, both individually and collectively, and showcases influences and inspiration from Memphis soul to rock, country and blues. One can sense The Band here, and Little Feat, some Led Zeppelin, and a tent revival; a full palette. Gorman rightly calls it a 'rock band that can jam.' \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01.

And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what happens on Trigger HippyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a funky/soulful underpinning to the entire 11-song set, but these musicians are all versatile enough that they easily skirt genre lines and glide smoothly into crunchy riff-rock, gritty roadhouse blues and hipster countrypolitan, often finding that happy nexus where it all becomes something else. (The vocal front line of Osborne and Greene proves particularly simpatico.) Following a similar approach as fellow roots-jamband quasi-supergroup Tedeschi Trucks Band (minus that world-class slide), Trigger HippyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smartly crafted tunes are marked by shared sensibilities that are rare on a first effort. Oh, and did we mention that every one of these musicians can play like a mofo?
