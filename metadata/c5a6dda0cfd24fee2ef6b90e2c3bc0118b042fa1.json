Once a successful travel writer, she is forced to take whatever \r\njob comes her way, which of late is as a clerk in a travel agency. She lives \r\na solitary life as people who know about her situation openly shun her, even \r\nto the point of violent actions toward her. She, in turn, fosters that \r\nsolitary life because of the incident, the aftermath of which has turned her \r\ninto a meek and scared woman. That incident involved her son Kevin \r\nKhatchadourian, who is now approaching his eighteenth birthday. Eva and \r\nKevin have always had a troubled relationship, even when he was an infant. \r\nWhatever troubles he saw, Franklin, Eva's complacent husband, just attributed \r\nit to Kevin being a typical boy. The incident may be seen by both Kevin and \r\nEva as his ultimate act in defiance against his mother.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Tilda Swinton.\r\n=&gt;-John C.
