It includes new modeling tools, such as the Architecture Explorer, which graphically displays projects and classes and the relationships between them. It supports UML activity diagram, component diagram, (logical) class diagram, sequence diagram, and use case diagram. Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes Test Impact Analysis which provides hints on which test cases are impacted by modifications to the source code, without actually running the test cases. This speeds up testing by avoiding running unnecessary test cases.\n\nVisual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes a Historical Debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace. Unlike the current debugger, that records only the currently-active stack, IntelliTrace records all events like prior function calls, method parameters, events, exceptions etc. This allows the code execution to be rewound in case a breakpoint wasn't set where the error occurred. IntelliTrace will cause the application to run slower than the current debugger, and will use more memory as additional data needs to be recorded. Microsoft allows configuration of how much data should be recorded, in effect allowing developers to balance speed of execution and resource usage. The Lab Management component of Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 uses virtualization to create a similar execution environment for testers and developers. The virtual machines are tagged with checkpoints which can later be investigated for issues, as well as to reproduce the issue. Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes the capability to record test runs that capture the specific state of the operating environment as well as the precise steps used to run the test. These steps can then be played back to reproduce issues.\n\nshared for http://hmavpn.org - get VPN now to protect your online privacy and download securely and encrypted!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:108abd16e6dd265d9e8c0f6a8e9736af6eea749c","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Visual+Studio+2010+Ultimate.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"108abd16e6dd265d9e8c0f6a8e9736af6eea749c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,138,189,22,230,221,38,93,158,140,15,106,142,151,54,175,110,234,116,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
