Piano teacher Irma Irene Justicia, M.A., who has taught at the renowned Juilliard School of Music, guides you with video demonstrations of techniques. Songs and exercises are enhanced by live recorded audio, MIDI tracks you can slow down or speed up, and colorful MIDI accompaniments. Interactive review and ear training screens help reinforce new concepts and develop your ear. This new version includes larger easy-to-read screens, enhanced audio and video, progress tracking, and an updated curriculum. When used with an electronic MIDI keyboard, you can get specific feedback on playing mistakes, including wrong notes and rhythms. YouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll learn how to play and learn a lot about music as well!\n\nPiano &amp; Keyboard Method features music from classics to popular modern hits to make learning fun! Enhanced multi-track audio and colorful MIDI accompaniments enhance the learning experience, and our Method includes hits popularized by artists such as:\n\n    * Billy Joel (&quot;Piano Man&quot;)\n    * Elton John (&quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;)\n    * Los Lobos (&quot;La Bamba&quot;)\n    * Bob Dylan (&quot;KnockinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ on HeavenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Door&quot;)\n    * Scott Joplin (&quot;The Entertainer&quot;)\n    * Ludwig van Beethoven (&quot;Ode to Joy&quot;)\n    * Spencer Williams (&quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot;)\n\nWINDOWS or MAC\n\n\nBy the way, this doesn't need any serial number, cracks, patches, etc.  Once you install it, you don't actually need the iso again unless you want to see the video.  It will complain about the disc not being present, but will start up and run ok.\n\nA couple notes on running it;\n+ Using File -&gt; Exit instead of just closing the window will keep it running\n  longer before a fubar's.\n+ If it does fubar, rebooting the system is the only thing I've found that helps.\n  If you reboot your system on a nightly/every couple days you'll probably never\n  see any problems with this software.\n+ You'll know when it fubar's, because the menus will stop working, and the text\n  will be all f'ed up.\n+ Some songs will generate an error no matter what.  Hitting &quot;OK&quot; and going on\n  is all you can really do.\n+ The &quot;Interactive review&quot; is good to within 5%.  It often lists problems that\n  didn't actually happen.\n+ If you start, and then stop right away, give the review engine a couple seconds\n  to generate a score, before you start again.  Else it won't figure out that you\n  started the song over.\n\nTo be honest, the program is flaky as hell, but you do learn how to play.\nHope everyone enjoys it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2064dd65390cb814f474a8c90342f33ee63fbe8","amp;dn":"eMedia+Piano+and+Keyboard+Method+v2.0+--+ISO+%28Win%2FMac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2064dd65390cb814f474a8c90342f33ee63fbe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,6,77,214,83,144,203,129,79,71,74,140,144,52,47,51,238,99,251,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
