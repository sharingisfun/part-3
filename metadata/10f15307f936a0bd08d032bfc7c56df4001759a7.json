Lucy, her fiance Jonathan Harker (a solicitor), and her father Dr. Jack Seward (who runs the local asylum) try to make the Count feel welcome to England. The Count quickly takes the life of Mina, and proceeds to romance Lucy, with the intention of making her his greatest bride. Soon after the death of Mina, the Sewards call her father Dr. Abraham Van Helsing to come to their home. As Lucy falls deeper under the spell of the Count, Dr. Van Helsing almost immediately comes to understand that his daughter fell prey to a vampire and discovers the culprit to be none other than the Count himself. Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and Harker work together to foil the Count's plans to take Lucy away to his native Transylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10f15307f936a0bd08d032bfc7c56df4001759a7","amp;dn":"Dracula+%281979%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10f15307f936a0bd08d032bfc7c56df4001759a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,241,83,7,249,54,160,189,8,208,50,191,199,197,109,244,0,23,89,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
