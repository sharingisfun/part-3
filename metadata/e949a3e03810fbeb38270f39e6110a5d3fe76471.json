Mary and Paul have set three challenges to test the bakers on some store cupboard classics. To start things off there is a British favourite. It may sound simple, but the judges are looking for perfection - a uniform bake across the batch and a tasty savoury filling. The bakers really have to rise to the occasion in this signature challenge.\r\nThe technical challenge requires a steady hand to master its intricacies, and there's no room for error.\r\nAnd finally there is a show-stopper where the ovens are off and the fryers are out, as the bakers are challenged to do their version of a Spanish classic.\r\n\r\nEpisode 4\r\nThe Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, Series 3\r\nIt is week four in The Great British Bake Off tent. Joining host Jo Brand in the An Extra Slice studio are former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, chef Monica Galetti and comedian Henning Wehn. As well as dissecting this week's goings on in the tent, Jo interviews the latest baker to leave and reveals more exclusive footage from the BBC One show.\r\nIt is batter week in the tent, so Jo and her guests discuss the remaining nine bakers and their sweet and savoury creations, as well as tasting the bakes brought in by the studio audience. Plus, they look at viewers' photos of their attempts from home - the good, the bad and the downright ugly.\r\nAn Extra Slice - when just one helping of Bake Off just isn't enough","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e949a3e03810fbeb38270f39e6110a5d3fe76471","amp;dn":"T.G.British.Bake.Off-S07E04.-.Extra.Slice-S03E04--w.subs-540p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e949a3e03810fbeb38270f39e6110a5d3fe76471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,73,163,224,56,16,251,235,56,39,15,57,230,17,10,93,63,231,100,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
