The performance of materials can be increased by combining different materials to achieve better properties than a single constituent or by shaping the material or constituents in a specific structure. The interaction between material and structure may arise on different length scales, such as micro-, meso- or macroscale, and offers possible applications in quite diverse fields.\r\n\r\nThis book series addresses the fundamental relationship between materials and their structure on the overall properties (e.g. mechanical, thermal, chemical or magnetic etc.) and applications.\r\n\r\nThe topics of Advanced Structured Materials include but are not limited to\r\n\r\nclassical fibre-reinforced composites (e.g. class, carbon or Aramid reinforced plastics)\r\nmetal matrix composites (MMCs)\r\nmicro porous composites\r\nmicro channel materials\r\nmultilayered materials\r\ncellular materials (e.g. metallic or polymer foams, sponges, hollow sphere structures)\r\nporous materials\r\ntruss structures\r\nnanocomposite materials\r\nbiomaterials\r\nnano porous metals\r\nconcrete\r\ncoated materials\r\nsmart materials\r\nAdvanced Structures Material ist indexed in Google Scholar and Scopus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:454f4f31bcd21aea2db562e6d0d253f16d900c63","amp;dn":"Advanced+Structured+Materials+%5BUpdated+at+2016.10.05%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"454f4f31bcd21aea2db562e6d0d253f16d900c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,79,79,49,188,210,26,234,45,181,98,230,208,210,83,241,109,144,12,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
