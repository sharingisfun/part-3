Without human presence, the land is roamed by wildlife like civets, macaques and wild boars. A project is underway to study the deserted areas by attaching a camera to wild boars to record the conditions of the former farmlands. 5 years after the disaster, we take a close look at how radiation has affected the wildlife, and what it entails for us humans.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2735Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.58 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 50 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.00 GB\r\nSource: HDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:311958249162bc36bcc6a01749ff1e46dd3d134d","amp;dn":"NHK+Radioactive+Forest+720p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"311958249162bc36bcc6a01749ff1e46dd3d134d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,25,88,36,145,98,188,54,188,198,160,23,73,255,30,70,221,61,19,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
