Look no further. LESS and SASS are CSS style sheet tools called preprocessors that add these features and more, simplifying the creation of complex CSS styles. In this course, author Joe Marini introduces the LESS and SASS tools in a two-part manner.\n\nThe first section focuses on LESS (Leaner CSS) and how it can be used on both the client and the server. The lessons show how to work with variables, mixins, nested rules, and other features to easily create maintainable CSS.\n\nThe second section introduces SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets), which contains many of the same features as LESS, along with a few new ones. Joe also compares and contrasts the two tools, and explains how your platform and needs may influence which tool you choose.\n\nTopics include:\nWhat are LESS and SASS?\nUsing variables in your CSS\nWorking with reusable and parameterized mixins\nImplementing nested rules\nCombining CSS rules with operations\nUsing the built-in functions in LESS and SASS\nControlling the CSS output formatting\nImporting external files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6961b20d41f0722e61ffd47157aa6d6ad9efdc8","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+CSS+with+LESS+and+SASS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6961b20d41f0722e61ffd47157aa6d6ad9efdc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,150,27,32,212,31,7,34,230,31,253,71,21,122,166,214,173,158,253,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
