In addition to his sword-skills (typified |\n| by using the Niten Ichi style of simultaneously wielding a short and long  |\n| sword), he was a noted artist. The real Musashi lived from 1584-1645.      |\n|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     |\n| The Battle of Sekigahara reshaped Japan's power structure. In the battle   |\n| the Tokugawa faction challenged the ruling Toyotomi for control a Japan    |\n| that was in the process of unification. Tokugawa won a resounding victory. |\n| Shinmen Takezo and Honiden Matahachi were survivors from the battle's      |\n| losing side.
