I fell in love with this book when I first saw it but wasn't able to buy it. Some time later, I made the effort and did purchase the book. I still look through it from time to time, and each time I am as enthralled as I was when I first saw its pages.\nThe book contains many images that are popular from the Adams archives, and others that should be more popular. I recommend it greatly to those who already appreciate Ansel Adams work, and those who are about to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00baab59b778fe9b2df2045ed5a39b7398654304","amp;dn":"The+Portfolios+of+Ansel+Adams+%28Photo+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00baab59b778fe9b2df2045ed5a39b7398654304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,186,171,89,183,120,254,155,45,242,4,94,213,163,155,115,152,101,67,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
