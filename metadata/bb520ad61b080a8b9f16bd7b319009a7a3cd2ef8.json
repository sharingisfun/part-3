YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to use JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network class library to quickly and easily accomplish common networking tasks such as writing multithreaded servers, encrypting communications, broadcasting to the local network, and posting data to server-side programs.\n\nAuthor Elliotte Rusty Harold provides complete working programs to illustrate the methods and classes he describes. This thoroughly revised fourth edition covers REST, SPDY, asynchronous I/O, and many other recent technologies.\n\n1. Explore protocols that underlie the Internet, such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP.\n\n2. Learn how JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core I/O API handles network input and output.\n\n3. Discover how the InetAddress class helps Java programs interact with DNS.\n\n4. Locate, identify, and download network resources with JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s URI and URL classes.\n\n5. Dive deep into the HTTP protocol, including REST, HTTP headers, and cookies.\n\n6. Write servers and network clients, using JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s low-level socket classes.\n\n7. Manage many connections at the same time with the nonblocking I/O\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb520ad61b080a8b9f16bd7b319009a7a3cd2ef8","amp;dn":"Java+Network+Programming+%5B4th+Edition%5D+-+O%27Reilly+-+Elliotte+Rus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb520ad61b080a8b9f16bd7b319009a7a3cd2ef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,82,10,214,27,8,10,139,159,22,189,123,49,144,9,167,163,205,46,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
