Several musicians have contributed to Crippled Black Phoenix's albums and play with them during their live shows.\nMembers of the band used to play in other bands (including Iron Monkey, Gonga, Mogwai, Electric Wizard and others). In 2004, Justin Greaves began recording primitive sounds he had in mind for years. He was encouraged by Dominic Aitchison, and their ideas would lay the backbone for Crippled Black Phoenix.\nAlthough originally having an unorthodox start, since all the band members were part of and busy with other projects at the time of the band's founding, Crippled Black Phoenix remained committed to staying together and forged their sound. The band writes what they call &quot;endtime ballads,&quot; signifying both the slightly macabre nature of their songs and their unusual blend of styles as the final evolution in music. This blend has led to them being called everything from stoner-prog to freak-folk to doom.\nCrippled Black Phoenix have made live shows a focus and have performed in unusual venues, using Victorian-era instruments in tandem with more modern instruments\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\nGenre: Post-Rock / Alternative Rock\nQuality: 320 kbps\nAlbum List:\n\n(2006) Crippled Black Phoenix - Shark And Storms Ã¢ï¿½â€ž Blizzard Of Horned Cats [EP]\n(2007) Crippled Black Phoenix - A Love of Shared Disasters\n(2009) Crippled Black Phoenix - 200 Tons of Bad Luck\n(2009) Crippled Black Phoenix - Extra Tracks EP\n(2009) Crippled Black Phoenix - The Resurrectionists and Night Raider\n(2010) Crippled Black Phoenix - I, Vigilante\n(2012) Crippled Black Phoenix - (Mankind) The Crafty Ape\n(2012) Crippled Black Phoenix - No Sadness Or Farewell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f840f092dcb9f97fab198fc152b72bb708c95d","amp;dn":"Crippled+Black+Phoenix+Discography+%5B8+albums+%40+320kbps%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f840f092dcb9f97fab198fc152b72bb708c95d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,248,64,240,146,220,185,249,127,171,25,143,193,82,183,43,183,8,201,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
