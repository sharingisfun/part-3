In 1987 on the Sunset Strip, a small-town girl met a big-city dreamer - and in L.A.'s most legendary rock club, they fell in love to the greatest songs of the '80s. It's a hilarious feel-good love story told through the hit songs (including several medleys / live mash-ups) of iconic rockers Journey, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Pat Benatar, Whitesnake, and many more. The album was mixed by Michael Barbiero (Appetite For Destruction, ...And Justice For All). \nTracks\n Act 1\n &quot;Just Like Paradise/Nothin' but a Good Time&quot; - Lonny &amp; Entire Company\n &quot;Sister Christian&quot; - Sherrie, Drew, Mother, Father &amp; Company\n &quot;Too Much Time On My Hands/We Built This City&quot; - Drew, Dennis, Lonny, Stacee Jaxx, Regina &amp; Company\n &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; - Drew &amp; Company\n &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; - Regina &amp; Ensemble\n &quot;Heaven/More Than Words/To Be with You&quot; - Sherrie, Drew &amp; Company\n &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot; - Drew, Sherrie\n &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; - Sherrie, Stacee Jaxx &amp; Ensemble\n &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; - Drew, Sherrie, Stacee Jaxx &amp; Ensemble\n &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize/We're Not Gonna Take It (reprise)&quot; - Drew, Stacee Jaxx &amp; Company\n &quot;Harden My Heart/Shadows of the Night&quot; - Sherrie, Justice, Lonny &amp; Company\n &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; - Entire Company\n\n Act II &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; - Regina, Dennis, Lonny, Franz, Hertz &amp; Ensemble\n &quot;Any Way You Want It/I Wanna Rock (reprise)&quot; - Drew, Sherrie, Justice, Record Company Men &amp; Ensemble\n &quot;High Enough&quot; - Sherrie, Drew &amp; Company\n &quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You/Heat of the Moment&quot; - Sherrie, Drew, Stacee Jaxx &amp; Company\n &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot; - Regina, Franz, Hertz &amp; Ensemble\n &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot; - Dennis, Lonny &amp; Company\n &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot; - Sherrie, Drew, Lonny, Dennis, Justice, Stacee Jaxx, Franz, Hertz &amp; Ensemble\n &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; - Hertz +\n &quot;Oh Sherrie&quot; - Drew, Sherrie &amp; Ensemble\n &quot;The Search Is Over&quot; - Drew, Sherrie &amp; Company\n &quot;Renegade&quot; - Stacee Jaxx and Company +\n &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot; - Entire Company\n\n Original website: http://www.rockofagesmusical.com/about.php\n Please SEED after download!
