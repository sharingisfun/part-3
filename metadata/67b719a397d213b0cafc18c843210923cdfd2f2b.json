The lyrics fall into the same prepackaged categories as\n  previous albums -- either the girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leaving the boy or the boyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leaving the\n  girl, both of which are described with the sort of literary semi-prowess youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d\n  find in a high-school lit mag -- and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re filled with plenty of wordless\n  syllables (whoa, oh, oooh being the most frequent) to maximize their singalong\n  potential. The ballads donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t carry nearly as much heft as the faster songs,\n  even with the added benefit of S*A*M &amp; SluggoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s high-sheen production, but We\n  the Kings have never been concerned with heft anyway. Sunshine State of Mind\n  is a lightweight, breezy album, with just enough melodic mass to keep its\n  songs from floating out of listenersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ heads and into the ether.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
