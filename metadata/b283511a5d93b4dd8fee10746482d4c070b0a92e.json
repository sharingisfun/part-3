At the age of 16 she ran away to France and Switzerland with the poet Percy Shelley. She married him in 1816 after his wife committed suicide by drowning. Although she had written other books such as Ã¢â‚¬ËœLodoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœFaulknerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœMathilde,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ none of them carried the essence of her work as did Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrankenstein.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ This well-known story started as her contribution to a ghost-story competition. Percy Shelley died in a shipwreck in 1822. Mary spent the remainder of her life championing her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s neglected poetry. She died in her sleep at the age of fifty-four.
