Levin (The Great Debate: Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, and the Birth of Right and Left, 2013, etc.), founder of the journalÂ National AffairsÂ and a distinguished student of Edmund Burke, understands that a middle lies between left and right.  \r\n\r\nRefreshingly optimistic; in our diversity lies great strength, Levin writes, a strength that can be tapped once all the rancor is put aside. Highly recommended for readers of whatever political stripe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02046d6110f3bc66853c09807fbea02d0cf0e867","amp;dn":"The+Fractured+Republic+-+Yuval+Levin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02046d6110f3bc66853c09807fbea02d0cf0e867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,4,109,97,16,243,188,102,133,60,9,128,127,190,160,45,12,240,232,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
