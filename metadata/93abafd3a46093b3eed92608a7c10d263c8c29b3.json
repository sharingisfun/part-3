But one day the trail is suddenly closed by county police.\n\nNo reason is given. Rumours start - is there something in the woods that no one must see? That no one must even know about? Then Jack Reacher drifts into town. What does he make of the Do Not Enter tape strung between the trees?\n\nWritten by Lee Child\nRead by Dick Hill\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\n------------------------\nVisit Us:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93abafd3a46093b3eed92608a7c10d263c8c29b3","amp;dn":"Not+a+Drill+-+Lee+Child","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93abafd3a46093b3eed92608a7c10d263c8c29b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,171,175,211,164,96,147,179,238,217,38,8,167,193,13,38,60,140,41,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
