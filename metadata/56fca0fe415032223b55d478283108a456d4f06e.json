She is best known for her ballads about vulnerable young women from a female perspective that have been described by some music critics as &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;confident.&quot;\n\nTrisha Yearwood signed with MCA Records in 1990. She came to prominence with her debut single, &quot;She's in Love with the Boy&quot; which became a #1 hit on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart in 1991. Her second album release, Hearts in Armor (1992) reflected Yearwood's own personal issues, which won her widespread critical acclaim among music critics and further success in country music. Her later album releases such as The Song Remembers When (1993), Thinkin' About You (1995) and Everybody Knows (1996) also demonstrated her creative control, featuring collaborations from Rodney Crowell, Willie Nelson and Garth Brooks.\n\nYearwood also found major success in country radio during much of the 1990s, including with the 1997 song &quot;How Do I Live.&quot; Initially released on the soundtrack of the film, Con Air, the song was also issued on her &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation entitled (Songbook) A Collection of Hits (1997) and would eventually win Best Female Country Vocal Performance from the Grammy Awards. In addition she would also win accolades from the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association Awards in 1997 and 1998. Aside from her success in country music, she has also donated her time as a philanthropist, working with Habitat for Humanity and the Make a Wish Foundation. In addition she also set aside a project to release her first cookbook in April 2008 titled Georgia Cooking in an Oklahoma Kitchen, which consisted of southern cooking recipes from Yearwood, her mother and sister\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56fca0fe415032223b55d478283108a456d4f06e","amp;dn":"Trisha+Yearwood+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56fca0fe415032223b55d478283108a456d4f06e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,252,160,254,65,80,50,34,59,85,212,120,40,49,8,164,86,212,240,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
