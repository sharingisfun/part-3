In this age of computer systems and technology, an increasing majority of the world's information is stored electronically. It makes sense then that as an industry we rely on high-tech electronic protection systems to guard that information.\n\nAs a professional hacker, I get paid to uncover weaknesses in those systems and exploit them. Whether breaking into buildings or slipping past industrial-grade firewalls, my goal has always been the same: extract the informational secrets using any means necessary.\n\nAfter hundreds of jobs, I discovered the secret to bypassing every conceivable high-tech security system. This book reveals those secrets, and as the title suggests, it has nothing to do with high technology. As it turns out, the secret isn't much of a secret at all. Hackers have known about these techniques for years.\n\nPresented in a light, accessible style, you'll get to ride shotgun with the authors on successful real-world break-ins as they share photos, videos and stories that prove how vulnerable the high-tech world is to no-tech attacks.\n\nAs you browse this book, you'll hear old familiar terms like &quot;dumpster diving&quot;, &quot;social engineering&quot;, and &quot;shoulder surfing&quot;. Some of these terms have drifted into obscurity to the point of becoming industry folklore; the tactics of the pre-dawn information age. But make no mistake; these and other old-school tactics work with amazing effectiveness today. In fact, there's a very good chance that someone in your organization will fall victim to one or more of these attacks this year. Will they be ready?\n\n* Dumpster Diving\nBe a good sport and don't read the two &quot;DÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ words written in big bold letters above, and act surprised when I tell you hackers can accomplish this without relying on a single bit of technology (punny). \n\n* Tailgating\nHackers and ninja both like wearing black, and they do share the ability to slip inside a building and blend with the shadows.\n\n* Shoulder Surfing\nIf you like having a screen on your laptop so you can see what you're working on, don't read this chapter.\n\n* Physical Security\nLocks are serious business and lock technicians are true engineers, most backed with years of hands-on experience. But what happens when you take the age-old respected profession of the locksmith and sprinkle it with hacker ingenuity?\n\n* Social Engineering with Jack Wiles\nJack has trained hundreds of federal agents, corporate attorneys, CEOs and internal auditors on computer crime and security-related topics. His unforgettable presentations are filled with three decades of personal &quot;war stories&quot; from the trenches of Information Security and Physical Security. \n\n* Google Hacking\nA hacker doesn't even need his own computer to do the necessary research. If he can make it to a public library, Kinko's or Internet cafe, he can use Google to process all that data into something useful.\n\n* P2P Hacking\nLet's assume a guy has no budget, no commercial hacking software, no support from organized crime and no fancy gear. With all those restrictions, is this guy still a threat to you? Have a look at this chapter and judge for yourself.\n\n* People Watching\nSkilled people watchers can learn a whole lot in just a few quick glances. In this chapter we'll take a look at a few examples of the types of things that draws a no-tech hacker's eye.\n\n* Kiosks\nWhat happens when a kiosk is more than a kiosk? What happens when the kiosk holds airline passenger information? What if the kiosk holds confidential patient information? What if the kiosk holds cash?\n\n* Vehicle Surveillance\nMost people don't realize that some of the most thrilling vehicular espionage happens when the cars aren't moving at all!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon Customer Ratings (17 Reviews):\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5 star: (9)\n4 star: (4)\n3 star: (3)\n2 star: (1)\n1 star: (0)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
