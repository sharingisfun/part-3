In the UK, it attained Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in January 1986, at the same time as The Last in Line.\n\nThe original vinyl release had a photo-montage LP-liner, with images from both Rainbow and Black Sabbath days.\n\nThe album was remastered and re-released by Rock Candy Records in 2005. The only notable addition to the original album is an audio interview with Ronnie James Dio. Tracks 10-19 on the 2005 edition are Dio's answers to various questions about the album. The questions are not posed during the interview itself, but can be found inside the CD's booklet instead. The B-sides to the singles, most of them live, remain generally unavailable on CD. Some were included in a limited-edition Japanese CD box set. The album, along with The Last in Line and Sacred Heart, will be released in a new 2 CD Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deluxe EditionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on March 19, 2012 through Universal for the world outside the U.S.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;Stand Up and Shout&quot;   \tJimmy Bain, Dio \t3:18\n2. \t&quot;Holy Diver&quot;   \tDio \t5:51\n3. \t&quot;Gypsy&quot;   \tVivian Campbell, Dio \t3:39\n4. \t&quot;Caught in the Middle&quot;   \tVinny Appice, Campbell, Dio \t4:14\n5. \t&quot;Don't Talk to Strangers&quot;   \tDio \t4:53\n6. \t&quot;Straight Through the Heart&quot;   \tBain, Dio \t4:31\n7. \t&quot;Invisible&quot;   \tAppice, Campbell, Dio \t5:24\n8. \t&quot;Rainbow in the Dark&quot;   \tAppice, Bain, Campbell, Dio \t4:15\n9. \t&quot;Shame on the Night&quot;   \tAppice, Bain, Campbell, Dio \t5:19\n\nDELUXE EDITION - BONUS DISC\n\n1. \t&quot;Evil Eyes (B-Side to Holy Diver single)&quot;   \t \n2. \t&quot;Stand Up &amp; Shout (Live B-Side)&quot;   \t \n3. \t&quot;Straight Through the Heart (Live B-Side)&quot;   \t \n4. \t&quot;Stand Up &amp; Shout (Live, King Biscuit Flower Hour, Oct 30, 1983)&quot;   \t \n5. \t&quot;Shame on the Night (Live, King Biscuit Flower Hour, Oct 30, 1983)&quot;   \t \n6. \t&quot;Children of the Sea (Live, King Biscuit Flower Hour, Oct 30, 1983)&quot;   \t \n7. \t&quot;Holy Diver (Live, King Biscuit Flower Hour, Oct 30, 1983)&quot;   \t \n8. \t&quot;Rainbow in the Dark (Live, King Biscuit Flower Hour, Oct 30, 1983)&quot;   \t \n9. \t&quot;Man on the Silver Mountain (Live, King Biscuit Flower Hour, Oct 30, 1983) (Ritchie Blackmore/Dio)&quot;   \t ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca8e08d7a07792406ac7862225e44dbff69b75e","amp;dn":"Dio+-+Holy+Diver+%5BDELUXE+EDITION%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca8e08d7a07792406ac7862225e44dbff69b75e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,168,224,141,122,7,121,36,6,172,120,98,34,94,68,219,255,105,183,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
