Publishers Weekly called it Ã¢â‚¬Å“an enjoyable, eccentric read, distinguished by well-developed characters, a believable Welsh setting, and some very creepy monsters.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis second novel begins in 1940, immediately after the first book ended. Having escaped Miss PeregrineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s island by the skin of their teeth, Jacob and his new friends must journey to London, the peculiar capital of the world. Along the way, they encounter new allies, a menagerie of peculiar animals, and other unexpected surprises.\n\nComplete with dozens of newly discovered (and thoroughly mesmerizing) vintage photographs, this new adventure will delight readers of all ages.\n\nReview\n\nAn Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2014: In Hollow City, Ransom Riggs continues the story that mesmerized readers in Miss PeregrineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Home for Peculiar Children. With their island home compromised, and Miss Peregrine trapped in her bird state, Jacob and the other peculiars flee into the larger world and find themselves in war-torn 1940Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s London. On those broken streets, with &quot;blacked out windows staring like lidless eyes,&quot; Jacob learns to trust himself, finds comfort in belonging, and falls over the precipice into love. As in his earlier novel, Hollow City is filled with eerily fascinating vintage photographs, and like a seasoned magician Riggs seamlessly incorporates them into a story already so well established in many ways that such a feat seems remarkable.--Seira Wilson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9cbde18c672c9d6f6d024bcd59e4eb6987de171","amp;dn":"Hollow+City+-+Ransom+Riggs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9cbde18c672c9d6f6d024bcd59e4eb6987de171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,203,222,24,198,114,201,214,246,208,36,188,213,158,78,182,152,125,225,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
