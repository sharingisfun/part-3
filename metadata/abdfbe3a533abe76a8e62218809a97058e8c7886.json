Scientology is laid bare by a film that skilfully knits together archive footage, testimonials from former high ranking officials and public, and dramatic reconstructions.\n\nWikipedia:\n\nGoing Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is a 2015 documentary film about Scientology directed by Alex Gibney, based on Lawrence Wright's 2013 book, Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief. Produced by HBO, the film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. It received widespread praise from critics for its deconstruction of the church's claims through a combination of presenting a condensed history of Scientology and its founder, how celebrities interact with the church, the stories of a number of ex-members and the abuse and exploitation that they described seeing and experiencing. The church responded vehemently to the film, complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the film-makers and their interviewees. Going Clear was released in a limited number of theaters on March 13, 2015 and aired on HBO on March 29, 2015.\n\nThe film is based on the Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning journalist Lawrence Wright's book Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief, which was published in January 2013 and was a National Book Award finalist. HBO announced in December 2014 that Alex Gibney, an Oscar-winning director who made Taxi to the Dark Side and The Armstrong Lie, was directing a film based on the book, to be released at the 2015 Sundance Festival. It was the first time that HBO had tackled Scientology directly, though not the first time it had clashed with the church, which had mounted demonstrations outside HBO's headquarters after a 1998 documentary presented anti-depressant drugs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fiercely opposed by Scientology Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in a positive light","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abdfbe3a533abe76a8e62218809a97058e8c7886","amp;dn":"GOING+CLEAR+-+HD+x264+720p+MP4+plus+South+Park+Episode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abdfbe3a533abe76a8e62218809a97058e8c7886","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,223,190,58,83,58,190,118,168,230,34,24,128,154,151,5,142,140,120,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
