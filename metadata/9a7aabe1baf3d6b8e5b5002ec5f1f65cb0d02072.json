The purpose of this book is to create the first comprehensive resource on the theory and applications of isoconversional methodology. The book introduces the reader to the kinetics of physical and chemical condensed phase processes that occur as a result of changing temperature and discusses how isoconversional analysis can provide important kinetic insights into them. The book will help the readers to develop a better understanding of the methodology, and promote its efficient usage and successful development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a7aabe1baf3d6b8e5b5002ec5f1f65cb0d02072","amp;dn":"Isoconversional+Kinetics+of+Thermally+Stimulated+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a7aabe1baf3d6b8e5b5002ec5f1f65cb0d02072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,122,171,225,186,243,214,184,229,181,0,46,197,241,246,92,176,208,32,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
