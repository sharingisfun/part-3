It was the band's first studio album to be recorded digitally, and is based on the soundtrack to the film Highlander, the first in a series directed by Russell Mulcahy.\n\nAlthough Queen would release another three albums with Freddie Mercury (including the posthumous Made in Heaven), A Kind of Magic would turn out to be the band's last ever album promoted with a concert tour, because of Mercury's diagnosis with AIDS the following year and his eventual death from AIDS in 1991. For the first time in their career, the band allowed filming of them while they were in the recording studio. The video for &quot;One Vision&quot; shows them in various stages of writing and recording the song.\n\nA Kind of Magic reached #1 in the UK, selling 100,000 copies in its first week, and remained in the UK charts for 63 weeks. The album spawned three hit singles: the album's title track &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, &quot;One Vision&quot; and &quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot;. The sixth track on the album, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, features an orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen, while the last track, &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;, is the theme song to Highlander.\n\nCritical reaction to the album was mixed, but it has, in recent years, been cited by music publications and fans as one of Queen's best records of the 1980s. The 1994 edition of the Guinness All Time Top 1000 Albums listed A Kind of Magic #171 in the all-time greatest rock and pop albums, and in 2007, Classic Rock ranked it the 28th greatest soundtrack album of all time. Estimates of the albums sales currently stand at fourteen million copies.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;One Vision&quot;   \tQueen \t5:10\n02. \t&quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t4:24\n03. \t&quot;One Year of Love&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t4:26\n04. \t&quot;Pain Is So Close to Pleasure&quot;   Deacon, Mercury \t4:21\n05. \t&quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot;   \tDeacon, Mercury \t4:07\n06. \t&quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;   \tBrian May \t5:15\n07. \t&quot;Gimme the Prize (Kurgan's Theme)&quot;   \tMay \t4:34\n08. \t&quot;Don't Lose Your Head&quot;   \tTaylor \t4:38\n09. \t&quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;   \tMercury \t3:32\n\n2011 Bonus EP\n\n01. \t&quot;A Kind of Magic (Highlander version)&quot;   \t4:22\n02. \t&quot;One Vision (Single version)&quot;   \t4:00\n03. \t&quot;Pain Is So Close to Pleasure (Single remix)&quot;   \t3:57\n04. \t&quot;Forever (Piano version)&quot;   \t3:20\n05. \t&quot;A Kind of Magic (Demo, August 1985)&quot;   \t3:23\n06. \t&quot;One Vision (Live at Wembley Stadium, 11 July 1986)&quot;   \t5:12\n07. \t&quot;Friends Will Be Friends Will Be Friends&quot;   \t5:59","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9859f1a1bb061f86db455f3b9c5136cd10d50108","amp;dn":"Queen+-+A+Kind+Of+Magic+%5Bwith+BONUS+EP%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9859f1a1bb061f86db455f3b9c5136cd10d50108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,89,241,161,187,6,31,134,219,69,95,59,156,81,54,205,16,213,1,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
