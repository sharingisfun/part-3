Its leathery, pebbled hide wraps around a cartilaginous frame, but it is no shark. It is the Demon Ray, feared even by the fabled Great White. It bears no stinger on its tail, but keratinous spikes, and its wings bear these weapons as well. On its mouth polyps it bears jagged teeth, and its baleful eyes watch all around it for food. Beware, when you set sail - the Demon Ray may be hunting for you!\r\n \nhttp://www.daz3d.com/demon-ray","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac315a9cd01abd018e40bb8c0362669b78cf99f6","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+-+Demon+Ray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac315a9cd01abd018e40bb8c0362669b78cf99f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,49,90,156,208,26,189,1,142,64,187,140,3,98,102,155,120,207,153,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
