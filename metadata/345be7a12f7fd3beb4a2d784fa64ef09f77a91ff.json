B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song\nof Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the\nfirst of which is titled A Game of Thrones. Filmed in a Belfast studio\nand on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Malta, Scotland, Croatia,\nIceland and Morocco, it premiered on HBO in the United States on April\n17, 2011. The series completed airing its fifth season on June 14, 2015,\nand has been renewed for a sixth season.\n\nSeven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros.\nPolitical and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of\nWesteros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of\nthe King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand\nwas assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further.\nMeanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to\ntake power.\n\nAcross the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed\nruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne.\nThe friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and with\nthe remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, leads to\nfull-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest\nnorth.\n\nAmidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of\nmisfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of\nmen and icy horrors beyond.\n\nFILE INFO:\n\nContainers......: mkv\nFile Size.......: 12,09 GB (248 MB per episode)\nVideo...........: resolution 720x406 (16:9, x264)\nVideo Quality...: Constant RF: 22,0\nAudio...........: 2.0 channels (aac, 128 kbps)\nAudio Language..: English / Valyrian / Dothraki\nFrame Rate......: 23,976 fps\nSources.........: Game.of.Thrones.S01.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY\nGame.of.Thrones.S02.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY\nGame.of.Thrones.S03.720p.BluRay.x264-DEMAND\nGame.of.Thrones.S04.720p.BluRay.x264-DEMAND\nGame.of.Thrones.S05.720p.HDTV.x264 (various)\nSamples.........: Yes\n\nSubtitles:\n\nEnglish: separate SRTs\nEnglish for non-English dialogue: Seasons 1-4 SRTs muxed-in\n/w forced flag, season 5 hardcoded\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/30m370nmw/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/30m370nmw/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEPISODE LIST:\n\nSEASON 1\n\nS01E01 Winter Is Coming\nS01E02 The Kingsroad\nS01E03 Lord Snow\nS01E04 Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things\nS01E05 The Wolf and the Lion\nS01E06 A Golden Crown\nS01E07 You Win or You Die\nS01E08 The Pointy End\nS01E09 Baelor\nS01E10 Fire and Blood\n\nSEASON 2\n\nS02E01 The North Remembers\nS02E02 The Night Lands\nS02E03 What Is Dead May Never Die\nS02E04 Garden of Bones\nS02E05 The Ghost of Harrenhal\nS02E06 The Old Gods and the New\nS02E07 A Man Without Honor\nS02E08 The Prince of Winterfell\nS02E09 Blackwater\nS02E10 Valar Morghulis\n\nSEASON 3\n\nS03E01 Valar Dohaeris\nS03E02 Dark Wings, Dark Words\nS03E03 Walk of Punishment\nS03E04 And Now His Watch Is Ended\nS03E05 Kissed by Fire\nS03E06 The Climb\nS03E07 The Bear and the Maiden Fair\nS03E08 Second Sons\nS03E09 The Rains of Castamere\nS03E10 Mhysa\n\nSEASON 4\n\nS04E01 Two Swords\nS04E02 The Lion and the Rose\nS04E03 Breaker of Chains\nS04E04 Oathkeeper\nS04E05 First of His Name\nS04E06 The Laws of Gods and Men\nS04E07 Mockingbird\nS04E08 The Mountain and the Viper\nS04E09 The Watchers on the Wall\nS04E10 The Children\n\nSEASON 5\n\nS05E01 The Wars to Come\nS05E02 The House of Black and White\nS05E03 High Sparrow\nS05E04 Sons of the Harpy\nS05E05 Kill the Boy\nS05E06 Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\nS05E07 The Gift\nS05E08 Hardhome\nS05E09 The Dance of Dragons\nS05E10 Mother's Mercy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345be7a12f7fd3beb4a2d784fa64ef09f77a91ff","amp;dn":"Game+Of+Thrones+Complete+Season+1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5+mkv+ENglish+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345be7a12f7fd3beb4a2d784fa64ef09f77a91ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,91,231,161,47,127,211,190,180,162,215,132,250,100,239,9,247,122,145,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
