Following in the footsteps of the editorâ€™s first book in the series, Harnessing the Wheelwork of Nature, Dr. Tom Valoneâ€™s book chronologically traces the original intention that Nikola Tesla had for his wireless electricity and how he updated and expanded upon it later on, with reprints of his key articles, to the recent genius engineers and physicists who are now finally bringing this last and most elusive, highly advanced Tesla technology into reality. The Corum article (along with the Peterson article) on the Zenneck wave transmission experiments culminates the viewpoints of all of the bookâ€™s contributors. Its purposeful placement as the last chapter of the book, is because this exclusive article publication is a major scientific breakthrough, as testified by the bookâ€™s endorsement from Brigadier General Michael Miller, and foretells the understandable, visionary road to the corporate formation of wireless power utilities. Furthermore, this is the first and only book in the world which explains how an electromagnetic wave traveling across the electrically conductive surface of the earth, was predicted by Tesla and Zenneck (two pictures in the book show them together on pages 74 and 381) and why it is the essential missing link of any Tesla wireless transmission theory. Many of the contributors also nicely explain the â€œsurface wave phenomenonâ€ as well as â€œresonant earth-ionosphereâ€ modes of electrical transmission without wires that compliments the surface wave theory and experiment. Nikola Teslaâ€™s Electricity Unplugged therefore is a treasure compared to any other Tesla reference book currently in print, since it is jam-packed with personal stories of Tesla, such as one reprinted from the prestigious Smithsonian magazine, along with great illustrated slideshows adapted for the book format, the â€œsecretâ€ history of Teslaâ€™s wireless, the real Tesla electric car, high Q resonant power transfer examples being used today by Qualcomm, â€œTesla unpluggedâ€ explained in an easy-to-understand presentation by a Brookhaven National Lab scientist, wireless electricity article based on scalar waves, even including a couple amazing rigorous equation articles with wireless solutions for the tech audience, a unique and evocative Foreword by Nikola Teslaâ€™s last living direct descendant, all presented in a 457-page paperback book, suitable as a college or high school reader, or simply as an eye-opening, optimistic window onto the electrical genius regarded as the â€œMaster of Lightning,â€ with a priceless collection of nineteen (19) contributors not available anywhere else.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe document(s) are all scanned with 300dpi and features OCR, making them searchable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:564c60cbff0e21cfbf6b50eb3da31eecff770e4c","amp;dn":"the+wonderful+inventions+of+nikola+tesla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"564c60cbff0e21cfbf6b50eb3da31eecff770e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,76,96,203,255,14,33,207,191,107,80,235,61,163,30,236,255,119,14,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
