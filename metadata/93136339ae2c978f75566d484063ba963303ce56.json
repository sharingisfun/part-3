Barns, thatched cottages and poky farmhouses, yes, but not striking, contemporary buildings with swooping roofs and glass walls. However, Kevin McCloud thinks there is a quiet revolution going on in our countryside and to prove it, he reminds us of some of Grand Designs' most extraordinary country homes.\n\nKevin McCloud looks at the challenges of self-building in the countryside, where design must embrace and enhance tradition, yet often overcome stringent planning constraints. Drawing on footage from the show's 15-year history, as well as new visits to extraordinary homes, he finds out how pioneers at the forefront of architecture are transforming agricultural and historic buildings, and bringing cutting-edge contemporary design to rural parts.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 30-Jul-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93136339ae2c978f75566d484063ba963303ce56","amp;dn":"Grand.Designs.S15E04.480p.HDTV.x264-RMTeam.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93136339ae2c978f75566d484063ba963303ce56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,19,99,57,174,44,151,143,117,86,109,72,64,99,186,150,51,3,206,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
