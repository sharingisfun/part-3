I am a completist, so i had to have the best scans, all the covers, and i tried to not get advetisments in them.  *(Wish i knew of a program to edit cbr's and remove ads)*.  As i bonus i included the sketchbook.  You are going to want to get your hands on some 3d glasses for the Superman Beyond issues, although it is still readable without them, im sure its awesome with.  Anyways i included a doc with the reading order, you'll want to stick to that, even though there is a big gap between legion of 3 worlds issues, its meant to be that way, trust me.  \n\nDC Universe Zero\nDC Universe Last Will and Testament\nFinal Crisis (Issues 1-7 + Directors Cut of issue 1)\nFinal Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds (Issues 1-5)\nFinal Crisis: Requiem (plus Variant cover)(One-shot)\nFinal Crisis: Resist (One-shot)\nFinal Crisis: Revelations (Issues 1-5)\nFinal Crisis: Rogues Revenge (Issues 1-3)\nFinal Crisis: Secret Files (One-shot)\nFinal Crisis: Sketchbook (Bonus)\nFinal Crisis: Submit (One-shot)\nFinal Crisis: Superman Beyond (Issues 1-2) (3D)\n\n*UPDATE*\nIf you want to see what happened after the final crisis, i have other related torrents featuring the origins and omens stories (detailing the new beginnings of all DC universe comics post final-crisis), and the Faces of Evil stories (featuring a villain in each DC universe title and how they are changing the game).\nOrigins and Omens: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4925668/Final_Crisis_-_Orignis_and_Omens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4925668/Final_Crisis_-_Orignis_and_Omens&lt;/a&gt;\nFaces of Evil: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4925568/Final_Crisis_-_Faces_Of_Evil&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4925568/Final_Crisis_-_Faces_Of_Evil&lt;/a&gt;\nOr just click on my username to see all my DC Comics uploads.  there are more to come including the complete Final Crisis Aftermath series around November,  and the Blackest Night series (probablly broken up into 2 parts, part one will be done in october).\nMuch appreciation to the original uploaders and scanners.
