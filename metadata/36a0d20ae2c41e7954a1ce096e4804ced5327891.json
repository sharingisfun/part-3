Enjoy!\n\n&quot;The brutal siege of Orgrimmar is over. Garrosh Hellscream, the most infamous orc on Azeroth, now sits in chains. His tyrannical leadership of the Horde has been ended by his many enemies, and he must answer for his crimes. Renowned leaders from across the world gather in Pandaria to witness Garrosh's trial. Visions of his past atrocities are presented in vivid detail for all to see. But as history is revisited, old grievances and bitter memories come back into the light, and those in attendance begin to wonder if anyone among them is truly innocent. Mounting tensions and rising enmity steer the court to the brink of chaosÃ¢â‚¬Â¦as the world waits with bated breath for the verdict on the war crimes of Garrosh Hellscream.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36a0d20ae2c41e7954a1ce096e4804ced5327891","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+-+War+Crimes+-+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36a0d20ae2c41e7954a1ce096e4804ced5327891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,160,210,10,226,196,30,121,84,161,206,9,110,72,4,206,213,50,120,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
