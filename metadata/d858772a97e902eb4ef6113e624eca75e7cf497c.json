W.\nObviously dedicated to that inelastic tenet about crime not paying, Twentieth Century-Fox has fashioned another taut and grimly realistic melodrama in &quot;Cry of the City.&quot; For the cops and robbers adventure, which moved into the Roxy yesterday, is of the documentary-like school of film fiction epitomized by that studio's &quot;Kiss of Death,&quot; &quot;Call Northside 777&quot; and &quot;Boomerang.&quot; As in the latter pictures, authenticity of scene and dialogue and expert characterizations by stars and subordinates alike give conviction and no little excitement to a basically familiar theme. &quot;Cry of the City&quot; emerges as a starkly tough yarn with its heart and civic pride in the proper places.\n\nIt is, simply, the depiction of a chase through New York's streets with Martin Rome, a wounded hoodlum and cop killer suspected of a jewel robbery and another murder, as the fugitive, and Lieutenant Candella, the good right arm of the law, as the pursuer. Although both emerged from the same neighborhoodÃ¢â‚¬â€presumably our town's Little ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â€Rome is drawn as a natively intelligent out-law, who, while not outwardly vicious, apparently would not stop to use anyone for his nefarious purposes. Candella, on the other hand, is an intelligent, hard working and completely natural officer not broken by his environment. To the Rome who scoffs at his $94.43 weekly salary, he replies simply, &quot;but I sleep good nights.&quot; And the final demise of the fleeing Rome at the hands of Candella is not maudlin but justifiable and plausible.\n\nUnderstatement is the keynote of both Robert Siodmak's direction and Richard Murphy's pithy script. And Victor Mature, an actor once suspected of limited talents, turns in a thoroughly satisfying job as the sincere and kindly cop, who not only knows his business but the kind of people he is tracking down. Richard Conte's Martin Rome is not the flashy, gun-toting braggart. But as the indomitable and cruel killer he neatly uses his lines to accentuate a subdued characterization of a truly dangerous renegade. Include among fine supporting roles those of Hope Emerson, a thin-lipped, Amazon of a woman out of the Broadway stage, who appears as a hard masseuse framed by Conte; Berry Kroeger, as a conniving and ill-fated shyster lawyer; Shelley Winters, as the ex-girl friend who helps Conte elude the police, and Mimi Aguglia, Tito Vuolo and Tommy Cook, as the killer's frightened parents and brother. &quot;Cry of the City&quot; may be strident at times but its message, story and players are thoroughly effective.\n\nRiveting example of Siodmak's skill not only in transforming indifferent material, but in giving the feel of studio noir to location shooting. The familiar '30s theme (cop and criminal sharing the same deprived background in New York's Little Italy) acquires an almost metaphysical ring in being displaced by what turns into a literal cry of the city as the wounded gangster (Conte, terrific) goes on the run for the last few hours of his life, leaving behind him a dark trail of murder, pain and betrayal. Rarely has the cruel, lived-in squalor of the city been presented in such telling detail, both in the vivid portrayal of ghetto life and in the astonishing parade of corruption uncovered in the night (a slug-like shyster; a monstrous, sadistic masseuse; a sleazy refugee abortionist, etc).\n\nAfter a shoot out with the police, hardened crook Martin Rome ends up in hospital having shot dead a cop. Whilst he is recovering he is visited by his fiancÃƒÂ©e Teena Ricante and is pressurised by a lawyer named Niles to confess to participating in a jewel robbery, a crime of which he is innocent. Realising that Teena is about to be framed for the robbery, Rome absconds from the hospital and confronts Niles in his office. It transpires that Niles is representing the real jewel thief. In a fracas, Rome stabs Niles to death and takes flight with the stolen jewels, which had been hidden in Niles's safe. Pursued across New York City by a cop named Candella who was once a childhood friend, Rome attempts to track down the jewel thief's accomplice, Rose Givens, hoping to exchange the stolen jewels for cash. As the net closes in on Rome, his time and his luck soon begin to run out... \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 888mb\nDuration.... 01:31:27\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width.... 720\nFrame Height.... 576\nData Rate.... 1232kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 120kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d858772a97e902eb4ef6113e624eca75e7cf497c","amp;dn":"Cry+of+the+City+1948+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d858772a97e902eb4ef6113e624eca75e7cf497c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,88,119,42,151,233,2,235,78,246,17,62,98,78,202,117,231,207,73,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
