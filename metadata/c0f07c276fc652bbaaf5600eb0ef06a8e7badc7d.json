Without this knowledge it would not be possible to build safe, efficient and long-lasting buildings, structures and dwellings. Building materials in civil engineering provides an overview of the complete range of building materials available to civil engineers and all those involved in the building and construction industries. \n\nThe book begins with an introductory chapter describing the basic properties of building materials. Further chapters cover the basic properties of building materials, air hardening cement materials, cement, concrete, building mortar, wall and roof materials, construction steel, wood, waterproof materials, building plastics, heat-insulating materials, sound-absorbing materials and finishing materials. Each chapter includes a series of questions, allowing readers to test the knowledge they have gained. A detailed appendix gives information on the testing of building materials.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 440 pages\n# Publisher: Woodhead Publishing (May 28, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1845699556\n# ISBN-13: 978-1845699550","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0f07c276fc652bbaaf5600eb0ef06a8e7badc7d","amp;dn":"Building+Materials+in+Civil+Engineering+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0f07c276fc652bbaaf5600eb0ef06a8e7badc7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,240,124,39,111,198,82,187,170,245,96,14,176,239,6,168,231,186,220,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
