Find a failure-to-appear and collect big bucks: top score. How sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pull it all off: top secret.\n\nTrenton, New JerseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite used-car dealer, Jimmy Poletti, was caught selling a lot more than used cars out of his dealerships. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s out on bail and has missed his date in court, and bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is looking to bring him in. Leads are quickly turning into dead ends, and all too frequently into dead bodies. Even Joe Morelli, the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hottest cop, is struggling to find a clue to the suspected killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whereabouts. These are desperate times, and they call for desperate measures. So Stephanie is going to have to do something she really doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to do: protect former hospital security guard and general pain in her behind Randy Briggs. Briggs was picking up quick cash as PolettiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bookkeeper and knows all his bossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dirty secrets. Now Briggs is next on PolettiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s list of people to put six feet under.\n\nTo top things off, RangerÃ¢â‚¬â€resident security expert and StephanieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest temptationÃ¢â‚¬â€has been the target of an assassination plot. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dodged the bullet this time, but if Ranger wants to survive the next attempt on his life, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to enlist StephanieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help and reveal a bit more of his mysterious past.\n\nDeath threats, highly trained assassins, highly untrained assassins, and Stark Street being overrun by a pack of feral Chihuahuas are all in a dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work for Stephanie Plum. The real challenge is dealing with her Grandma MazurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wild bucket list. A boob job and getting revenge on Joe MorelliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grandma Bella can barely hold a candle to whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s number one on the listÃ¢â‚¬â€but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top secret.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9f48513fc597d549e7ce9c3703fa8b7154f2d18","amp;dn":"Janet+Evanovich+-+Top+Secret+Twenty-One+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9f48513fc597d549e7ce9c3703fa8b7154f2d18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,244,133,19,252,89,125,84,158,124,233,195,112,63,168,183,21,79,45,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
