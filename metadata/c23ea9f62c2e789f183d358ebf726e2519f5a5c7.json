Actually, James had been with Motown earlier, though nothing had come of it. After growing up in Buffalo and running away to join the Naval Reserves, he ran away from the Navy to Toronto, where he was in a band with future Buffalo Springfield members Neil Young and Bruce Palmer, and with Goldy McJohn, later of Steppenwolf. As the Mynah Birds, they signed to Motown and recorded, though no record was ever released. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tMotown\nCat.#\t\t\t440 014 696-2\t\t\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.75% CDDA &amp; 99.92% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Give It To Me Baby\n02.Ghetto Life\n03.Make Love To Me\n04.Mr. Policeman\n05.Super Freak\n06.Fire And Desire (Duet With Teena Marie)\n07.Call Me Up\n08.Below The Funk (Pass The J)\n09.Give It To Me Baby (12-Inch Mix)\n10.Give It To Me Baby (12-Inch Mix Instrumental)\n11.Super Freak (12-Inch Mix)\n12.Super Freak (12-Inch Mix Instrumental)\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Introduction\n02.Ghetto Life\n03.Big Time\n04.Come Into My Life\n05.I'm A Sucker For Love\n06.Square Biz\n07.Fire It Up\n08.Love Gun\n09.Do You Want Some Funk (Interlude)\n10.Mary Jane\n11.Super Freak\n12.You And I\n13.Give It To Me Baby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c23ea9f62c2e789f183d358ebf726e2519f5a5c7","amp;dn":"Rick+James+-+Street+Songs+%5BDeluxe%5D+2CD+%282001%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c23ea9f62c2e789f183d358ebf726e2519f5a5c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,62,169,246,44,46,120,159,24,61,53,142,191,114,110,37,25,245,165,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
