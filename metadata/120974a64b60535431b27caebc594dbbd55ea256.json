He was such a dominant force on soprano, that he preferred to play lead rather than the trumpeter and few other musicians played soprano during his lifetime.\nBorn in 1897, Bechet was playing with top New Orleans bands while still a child. In 1917 he moved up North to Chicago, touring Europe with Will Marion Cook's orchestra in 1919. He first appeared on records in 1923, spent 1925-29 overseas, and struggled during the Depression. At one point he had a tailor shop that was most notable for its backroom jam sessions. In 1938, Bechet had a hit recording of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummertimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and it resulted in him recording a dazzling series of records during the next few years. His performance at the Salle Pleye Jazz Festival in Paris in 1949 caused a sensation. Bechet moved to France where he was a major celebrity during the years before his 1959 death.\nBlues in Thirds has 24 selections that Bechet recorded during 1940-41. With such musicians as Louis Armstrong, cornetists Muggsy Spanier (for a date in which the two horns were accompanied by guitar and bass) and Rex Stewart, trumpeters Sidney DeParis, Red Allen and Charlie Shavers, trombonists J.C. Higginbotham and Vic Dickenson, pianists Earl Hines and Willie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe LionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Smith, and drummer Baby Dodds being in the supporting cast, Bechet is heard throughout at the height of his powers.\n\n\nTracklist\nSidney Bechet Trio, Earl Hines \n01 Blues In Thirds 2:54\nSidney Bechet and His New Orleans Feetwarmers, Earl Hines  \n02 Ain't Misbehavin' 2:51\n03  Save It, Pretty Mama 2:52\n04  Stompy Jones 2:47\nSidney Bechet Trio, Willie The Lion Smith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \n05 You're the Limit 3:09\nLouis Armstrong Orchestra, Sidney Bechet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \n06 Perdido Street Blues 3:00\n07 Down In Honky, Tonk Town 3:03\nSidney Bechet and his New Orleans Feetwarmers  \n08 Old Man Blues 2:51\n09 Shake It And Break It 2:54\nSidney Bechet Trio, Willie The Lion Smith\n10 Strange Fruit 2:29\nSidney Bechet and his New Orleans Feetwarmers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \n11 Wild Man Blues 3:17\n12 The Mooche 2:58\n13 I Ain't Gonna Give Noboby (None O' This Jelly Roll) 3:13\n14 Blues In the Air 2:45\nSidney Bechet, Muggsy Spanier, Carmen Mastren, Wellman Braud\n15 China Boy 3:57\nSidney Bechet's Blue Note Quartet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \n16 Dear Old Southland 3:59\nSidney Bechet and his New Orleans Feetwarmers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \n17 Egyptian Fantasy 2:59\nSidney Bechet and his New Orleans Feetwarmers \n18 Baby, Won't You Please Come Home? 2:33\n19  Slippin' and Slidin' 2:50\n20  I Know That You Know (And You Know That I Know) 2:29\n21 I'm Comin' Virginia 2:37\n22  Georgia Cabin 2:56\n23 Limehouse Blues 2:34\n24 Texas Moaner Blues 2:57\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:120974a64b60535431b27caebc594dbbd55ea256","amp;dn":"Sidney+Bechet+Blues+In+Thirds%28jazz%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"120974a64b60535431b27caebc594dbbd55ea256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,9,116,166,75,96,83,84,49,178,124,174,188,89,77,187,213,94,162,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
