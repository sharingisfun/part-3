In China, he walks on the Great Wall, in Tunisia, he experiences a city under lockdown and, due to a booking error, ends up in one of Johannesburgâ€™s most notorious districts where he sees the Southern Hemisphereâ€™s tallest slum. His trip ends in the Indian Ocean, where he gets to see some of the hidden underbelly of crime and litter in the Maldives.\r\n\r\nAfrica to Asia: One man, two continents, eleven countries by Jason Smart\r\nEnglish | 2016 |226 pages | ePUB | 1.3 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:251fd3513c377a25fc336e7c34be8b2705ec8d48","amp;dn":"Africa+to+Asia%3A+One+man%2C+two+continents%2C+eleven+countries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"251fd3513c377a25fc336e7c34be8b2705ec8d48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,31,211,81,60,55,122,37,252,51,110,124,52,190,139,39,5,236,141,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
