To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called â€œSachiko Ever After,â€ which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end.\r\nThis does not go as expected.\r\nCorpse Party is the original Windows edition of the cult classic horror game that gained a considerable fanbase when released on Sonyâ€™s PlayStationÂ®Portable system in 2011. Beginning life as an independent RPG Maker adventure title in 1996, the gameplay was greatly refined and the story greatly expanded for this 2008 iteration, featuring more characters, more detailed interactions, darker story elements, over 5,000 lines of voice-acting and dozens of shocking, gruesome endings. Players take control of nine main characters and several side characters whoâ€™ve been split up into groups of two or three and trapped in a run-down, otherworldly elementary school full of vengeful spirits, deadly mysteries and â€“ of course â€“ corpses. As they walk around examining objects and bodies in an atmospheric 2D environment, a horror tale spanning over 50 years begins to unfold, and player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.\r\nHighly Detailed Retro-Style Graphics Used to Enhance Atmosphere\r\nAdventure-Style Gameplay Where Your Decisions Make All the Difference\r\nChapter-Based Storytelling with PC-Exclusive Content and a retelling of the â€œToothâ€ story from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows\r\nOriginal Japanese Voice Cast and Character Art plus Text Skip Feature\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: 1.5 GHz\r\nMemory: 512 MB RAM\r\nGraphics: 64 MB VRAM, 3D accelerator compatible w/ DirectX 9.0c\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c\r\nStorage: 4 GB available HD space\r\nSound Card: Compatible with DirectX 9.0c\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59790c6699f9d9cf01bc051dcdbd862f127610e3","amp;dn":"Corpse+Party+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59790c6699f9d9cf01bc051dcdbd862f127610e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,121,12,102,153,249,217,207,1,188,5,29,205,189,134,47,18,118,16,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
