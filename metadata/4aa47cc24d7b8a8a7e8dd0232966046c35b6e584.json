Their most notable hits include &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot;, &quot;Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time),&quot; &quot;Break Your Promise,&quot; &quot;I'm Sorry,&quot; and &quot;Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide from Love)&quot;. Their songs are written by lead vocalist and founder William Hart and have been used extensively in numerous film soundtracks, the most notable being Quentin Tarantino's movie Jackie Brown, in which their music (&quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot; and &quot;Didn't I Blow Your Mind&quot;) is used as a pivotal part of the plot to underscore the relationship between Pam Grier and Robert Forster. The film helped create a border-line cult following for the songs and this group. Their songs have been sampled extensively by various hip-hop and rap artists including: The Fugees (&quot;Ready or Not&quot;),The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Boyz II Men, Missy Elliott and DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince.
