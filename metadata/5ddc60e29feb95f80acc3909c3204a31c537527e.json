During those years, under his direction, the show has undergone many evolutions in costume and set, and different lead dancers have put their stamp on the various productions. For the purposes of this study, it is the original version of the show that will be referred to.)\n\nWhen Michael was fired from Riverdance the Show in October 1995, he disappeared from public view for several months, maintaining a dignified, stoical silence amidst a barrage of unbridled attack through the media. What the public did not know was that he was immediately fighting back in his own steadfast way, by creating a new show, this time one wholly and singly focused, with Ireland 'standing on her own two feet', undiluted by foreign dance disciplines. On December 30th 1995 he first showcased a prototype of the dance 'Warlords' with a group of male dancers, as an entertainment act during the Irish TV awards show at the National Concert Hall. The dancers all in black T-shirts and pants, dancing acapella, it transmitted as an extension of the 'Distant Thunder' dance from Riverdance the Show but already showed marked choreographic progression. It was announced as being part of Michael's new show Lord of the Dance. Michael said in a radio interview in June 1998 that no-one wanted to know him that day, no-one shook his hand as he headed for the stage, and only his two longtime close friends, radio presenter Gerry Ryan and Point Theatre owner Harry Crosbie stood loyally by him. So the rapturous audience response to the number, showing a strong wave of support for him personally and a ready appetite for more of his work must have been a life-giving tonic.\n\nAs publicity grew for the new show, many said 'Lightning can't strike twice!' There could never be another Riverdance, and especially not stretching the Irish content to be the entire show. However, as Michael said, they could not possibly know the vision he had or have any idea of all the wonderful developments he had still in mind for Irish dance. The July 1996 opening at the Point proved a shock experience for all those packing the theatre, so different was it to what they expected and to all that had gone before, yet still rooted firmly in the traditions of Ireland. On the surface the show presented a charming fairytale of a little child's dream, swathed in fantasy and myth, colourful costumes and updated, rock-oriented music, and connoisseurs of the dance marveled at the technical quality of the dancers Michael had trained and reveled in the superb choreography, this time unarguably Michael's own from beginning to end.\n\nHowever, Michael himself admitted in a couple of interviews that Lord of the Dance could be read a thousand different ways and he intended it to be so, and close study of the numbers, beyond the dancing, reveal a depth to the show and cultural details of provenance to which many who see it are oblivious. Those details are not only of interest to those who enjoy watching the shows from a more intellectual standpoint but also constitute an important part of the reason the Flatley shows stand alone amid all their many competitors. Some other shows have used a storyline, either traditionally based or newly invented, some have quality costuming and pleasing set, enjoyable music score, yet none to date has succeeded in being in the same league as a Flatley show, and given that many of the same skilled dancers move from show to show, the answer has to lie elsewhere. Now, since Michael has become 'the Billionaire Dancer', it is all too easy to put the difference down to being financial - Michael can spend whatever he wishes on the production while others barely scrape together sufficient funds to stage their shows professionally at all. With Lord of the Dance that certainly was not the case and yet with that show Michael created a classic of such strong global appeal that it can still sustain multiple visits to the same cities across the world after a full decade, and despite subsequent masterpieces, it remains the favourite of many showgoers.\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img824/4151/4tgf.gif[/IMG]\n\n**************************************************************************\n\nThe 'Riverdance' phenomenon has seen the show performed all over the world. This documentary on the popular musical follows its evolution, from its beginnings in Dublin up to its global success in places as diverse as New York City and Geneva. Highlights from the various performers who have taken roles in the performances around the world prove to be the best highlights, with Michael Flatley, Jean Butler, and many others displaying their talents. Of course the music is important as well, and it's fascinating to see various bands from different countries interpreting Bill Whelan's sensational score.\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nIl fenomeno &quot;RIVERDANCE&quot; ÃƒÂ¨ stato visto e applaudito in tutto il mondo.\nQuesto documentario di musica popolare irlandese ÃƒÂ¨ in continua evoluzione, \nnata nei sobborghi di Dublino si ÃƒÂ¨ espansa e rivoluzionata, fino a toccare l'apice del successo in cittÃƒÂ  come New York o Ginevra\nTanti artisti si sono succeduti portando in  ognuno di loro un modo diverso di interpretare la danza, \ninterpretazioni che hanno fatto il giro del mondo.\nGrandi interpreti come Michael Flatley o Jean Butler, e tanti altri.\nNaturalmente anche la musica ÃƒÂ¨ protagonista, resa celebre da  grandi BAND \ndi differenti paesi che interpretano a modo loro le grandi musiche di BILL WHELAN.\n\n*************************************************************************************\n\nDurata: \t124 min.\t\nGenere: \tMusicali e concerti\n\n\n\nFlatley ÃƒÂ¨ nato a Chicago (Illinois), da una famiglia di origine irlandese (i genitori erano di Sligo e Carlow). Cresciuto nel quartiere irlandese della cittÃƒÂ  Flatley comincia a studiare danza a 11 anni e nel 1975 diventa il primo non residente europeo a vincere il premio All-Ireland World Championship per la danza irlandese.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nOf the many shows that came in the wake of Riverdance, Magic Of The Dance is one of the more bizarre. Combining stiff-backed, rubber-legged Irish dancing with American tap, the show depicts a young couple who fall in love at a dance.\n\nEmigrating to the USA, they flee not only famine but fleet-footed mystical demons. The plot's irrelevant, however: Magic Of The Dance is pure spectacle. Marvel at costumes that resemble what ice-skaters might wear to a medieval banquet, Christopher Lee's hammy recorded narration and, most importantly, those flying legs and feet that never miss a beat, even when they burst into flames for the finale.\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img5/5551/qcit.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img838/2726/8nwn.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img24/4360/fn7d.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n***********************************************************************\n\n[IMG]http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/3893/datifile.gif[/IMG]\n\n[spoiler]\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Riverdance Lord Of The Dance - Michael Flatley - Gold - Chicago - (2000).avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 2h 4mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 785 Kbps\nWriting application              : Nandub v1.0rc2\nWriting library                  : Nandub build 1852/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : 2 warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 2h 4mn\nBit rate                         : 647 Kbps\nWidth                            : 480 pixels\nHeight                           : 256 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.875\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.211\nStream size                      : 577 MiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : DivX 5.0.2 (UTC 2002-05-16)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 4mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 111 MiB (16%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 141 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.92 \nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17.5 --abr 128\n\n\n\n[/b][/color]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ddc60e29feb95f80acc3909c3204a31c537527e","amp;dn":"Riverdance+Lord+Of+The+Dance+Michael+Flatley+-+Gold+at+Chicago+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ddc60e29feb95f80acc3909c3204a31c537527e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,220,96,226,159,235,149,248,10,204,57,9,195,32,74,49,197,55,82,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
