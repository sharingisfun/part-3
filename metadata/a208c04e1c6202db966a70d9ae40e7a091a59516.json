Drugs. Rock &amp; Roll.\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of all of the music featured in the first season of HBO's TV series &quot;Vinyl&quot;. Everything from songs central to the plot, to the stuff playing in the background. And I think it has the most extensive tracklist of any other show ever created.\r\n\r\n230 tracks in total, from 179 different artists. Genres vary from straight up rock &amp; roll, punk rock and pop, to jazz, soul and folk.\r\n\r\nIf you ever wanted to hear how the 70's sounded like, now you can. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a208c04e1c6202db966a70d9ae40e7a091a59516","amp;dn":"Vinyl+Season+1+Unofficial+Soundtrack+%28HBO+2016%29+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a208c04e1c6202db966a70d9ae40e7a091a59516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,8,192,78,28,98,2,219,150,106,112,217,174,64,231,160,145,165,149,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
