Involved is a diplomatic exchange where the original JLA travel forward to the future to exhibit heroic feats in celebration of the meeting.\n\nThe most complete DC One Million digital collection I could pull together, in reading order. Young Heroes in Love and Booster Gold 1000000 are missing as they've not been digitised as yet, but every issue integral to the storyline is present.\n\nAlso included is material foreshadowing the event, including the last couple of pages of the Rock of Ages storyline as well as the last two pages of JLA 23 (missing until now).\n\nAll credit to the original editors of most of this material as well as the person whose supplementary contribution makes this as complete as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab3939b9db4779afa503fc549a3b36f3c62cd41","amp;dn":"DC+One+Million","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab3939b9db4779afa503fc549a3b36f3c62cd41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,179,147,155,157,180,119,154,250,80,63,197,73,163,179,111,60,98,205,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
