Whatever the reason, almost all of his collaborations succeeded at high levels,\n although none of his shared sessions are more intriguing on the surface than this 1962 date with the preeminent sax star\n of the day. In reality, the record amounts to &quot;Coltrane Plays Ellington&quot; (plus one Coltrane original) because the tenor\n man is the whole show--and what a show it is. Only Coltrane could be as &quot;fiercely tender,&quot; and there's no better forum for\n his sensitive side than the music of Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, who contributes the album's true vertex,\n &quot;My Little Brown Book.&quot; The rhythm section alternates between Duke's and Trane's, each adding a different texture to \nthe proceedings. Ellington is wise enough to appreciate the nature of the session, and he is quite content to feed chords\n in service of the young master--proving the old master's open mind and good taste. Hearing Coltrane seize &quot;In a Sentimental\n Mood&quot; is thanks enough. \n\n========================================\n\n[color=red]General[/color]\n\nFile size                                : 686 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Duke Ellington &amp; John Coltrane\nPerformer                                : Piano|Duke Ellington|Soprano Saxophone, Tenor Saxophone|John Coltrane|Bass|Aaron Bell\nComposer                                 : Duke Ellington &amp; John Coltrane\nWritten by                               : Duke Ellington\nGenre                                    : Jazz\nRecorded date                            : 1997\nARRANGER                                 : Engineer|Rudy Van Gelder|Producer|Bob Thiele|Producer|Michael Cuscuna\nSOURCEMEDIA                              : Vinyl\n\n==================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 734 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\nReplay gain                              : -3.23 dB\nReplay gain peak                         : 0.988553\nStream size                              : 83.6 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                          : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:631940d81344bf2ad6d23b058fd48c856e643ba4","amp;dn":"Duke+Ellington+and+John+Coltrane+-+Duke+Ellington+and+John+Coltr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"631940d81344bf2ad6d23b058fd48c856e643ba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,25,64,216,19,68,191,42,214,210,59,5,143,212,140,133,110,100,59,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
