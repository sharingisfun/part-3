Its location and the pleasant climate are still reasons why it is a destination for so many people. If you travel to Crete you will land on its main airport, Heraklion International Airport &quot;Nikos Kazantzakis&quot;which has finally arrived in FSX and Prepar 3D.\n \nThe Heraklion International Airport Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Nikos KazantzakisÃ¢â‚¬Å“ will soon be replaced by a brand new airport because it simply is not able to handle the load in summer. But for now it is the second busiest airport in Greece and squeezed in between the sea and the city it has one of the most scenic approaches in the Mediterranean.  FSDG made this into a very special scenery, spend a few minutes looking at the product page and you will see the attention to detail is impressive.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04b73a886fe52fdf6dc23dd829caf6ac3bff04e","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Aerosoft+-+Heraklion+X+v1.00","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04b73a886fe52fdf6dc23dd829caf6ac3bff04e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,75,115,168,134,254,82,253,246,220,35,221,130,156,175,106,195,191,240,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
