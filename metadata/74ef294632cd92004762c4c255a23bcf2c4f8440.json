It can mean Ã¢â‚¬Å“the power you command,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or it can be a pun on Ã¢â‚¬Å“your arse anÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ all,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a joke about an association football club as subcultural identity. That suggests a song that might be a key to the recordÃ¢â‚¬â€a song thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not actually on it, but one that Morrissey had used to end his 1990 videotape Hulmerist and would use as entrance music some years later.\nThe specter of Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Never Walk AloneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the king of all football-fan sing-alongs thanks to its association with Liverpool (and Pink Floyd), hovers over the whole album: the chopped-up football- kop voices in the middle of Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Let You KnowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the chord progression and sentiment of Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Know ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gonna Happen SomedayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and most of all the relatively uncharacteristic first-person plural Morrissey uses and implies throughout Your Arsenal. Viewed in that light, beginning the album with a song called Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Gonna Need Someone on Your SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seems formally appropriate.\n\nBy 1992, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what Morrissey needed; he had apparently realized that, as Oscar Wilde might have put it, the only thing worse than being in a rock band was not being in a rock band. Your Arsenal, unlike the previous yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Kill Uncle, sounded like the work of a real groupÃ¢â‚¬â€as indeed it was. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d assembled guitarists Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer, bassist Gary Day, and drummer Spencer Cobrin for the extensive Kill Uncle tour, and kept them around to record. (Boorer is still playing with Morrissey today, and Whyte stayed with him until 2004.) Boorer had previously played with rockabilly revivalists the Polecats, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d had minor British hits with covers of David BowieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“John, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Only DancingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and T. RexÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“JeepsterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. And Morrissey roped in one of the former songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s architects to produce Your Arsenal: Mick Ronson, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been BowieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitarist and principal creative foil in the early 1970s.\n\nMorrissey has never been shy about paying homage to his favorite records, but Your Arsenal comes off at first like an out-and-out glam rock pasticheÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½glam rockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ defined, for these purposes, as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bowie plus T. Rex minus the stringsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Glamorous GlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stomps like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Jean GenieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Certain People I KnowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ cops its guitar licks from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ride a White SwanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Know ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gonna Happen SomedayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ winks so hard at Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll SuicideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that Bowie winked back, covering it a year later on Black Tie White Noise.\n\nThe homage that eventually emerges from Your Arsenal, though, is closer to home: it often sounds like Morrissey and Whyte (who co-wrote eight of its 10 songs) doing their best approximation of the Smiths. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s odd to intimate that someone would be imitating his own band, but really: there could have have been endless ways to arrange Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seasick, Yet Still DockedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound quite so much like the SmithsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“That Joke IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Funny AnymoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, for instance. On Viva Hate and Kill Uncle, Morrissey had been demonstrating what his voice and his oddball sense of tune could do with collaborators who distinctly werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Johnny Marr; this time, his band does their damnedest to recapture the old vibe.\n\nIt was inevitable that someone would be disgruntled with whatever Morrissey decided to do, and his habit of amplifying anything that annoys anyone means heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more Morrisseyesque than ever before here. That was great news for his singingÃ¢â‚¬â€his tics are his gloriesÃ¢â‚¬â€but it often blindsides his lyrics. MorrisseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commitment to ironizing everything including his own irony ends up undercutting any position he might be staking out. Hence Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the One for Me, FattyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, whose hookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cleverness leaves him flailing for other utterances to follow it up with. Hence also the (more or less) trumped-up furor over Ã¢â‚¬Å“The National Front DiscoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: Morrissey is clearly declaring Ã¢â‚¬Å“England for the EnglishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in great big quotation marks, especially considering that at the end of the previous track heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s announced that Ã¢â‚¬Å“we are the last truly British people youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever knowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€nationalism pumped up until it disintegrates into meaninglessnessÃ¢â‚¬â€but all the kisses heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blown to creeps and thugs make it harder to swallow.\n\nMorrissey canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist ironizing his own team spirit, either, which leads straight to the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best song and his solo careerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best joke, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Hate It When Our Friends Become SuccessfulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. (Egotists are always funnier when they can mock their own egotism.) Its Ã¢â‚¬Å“weÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a delicious bit of rhetoricÃ¢â‚¬â€it presumes the listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s agreementÃ¢â‚¬â€and so is the whiplash sequence of perspective shifts at the end: Ã¢â‚¬Å“You see, it shouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been meÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Everybody says so.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And what is it that makes MorrisseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work so different, so appealing? He spells it out: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Loads of songs/ So many songsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Verse/ Chorus/ Middle eight/ Break, fade.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nobody else is doing that!\n\nNaturally, Morrissey has now doubled down on the annoyance factor of his last few reissues by tinkering with the track listing of Your Arsenal a bitÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½TomorrowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has been replaced by its American single mix. In lieu of a tacky badge, this edition comes with a slightly muddy but passable live DVD filmed at CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shoreline Amphitheatre in October, 1991, four months or so after the concert that became the Live in Dallas video. The only song itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got in common with the album is Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Hate ItÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, which was then still six months away from its appearance as Your ArsenalÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs first single. The new band is solid, and they even work up a bit of rockabilly heat here and there, but nobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s threatening MorrisseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position as the captain of the team, so heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not particularly fighting for it.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74ef294632cd92004762c4c255a23bcf2c4f8440","amp;dn":"Morrissey+-+Your+Arsenal+%5BDefinitive+Master%5D+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74ef294632cd92004762c4c255a23bcf2c4f8440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,239,41,70,50,205,146,0,71,98,196,194,85,162,59,207,44,79,132,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
