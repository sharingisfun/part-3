But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched.\r\nEric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.\r\n\r\nThe Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on â€œvalidated learning,â€ rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.\r\n\r\nRather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before itâ€™s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07d8e13beae3e7efe2076a27d7f73eff7ba57136","amp;dn":"The+Lean+Startup%3A+How+Today%27s+Entrepreneurs+by+Eric+Ries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07d8e13beae3e7efe2076a27d7f73eff7ba57136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,216,225,59,234,227,231,239,226,7,106,39,215,247,62,255,123,165,113,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
