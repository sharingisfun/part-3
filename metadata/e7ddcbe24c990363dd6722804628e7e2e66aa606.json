In 1216, taking advantage of the turmoil created in England by King John's inept rule and the war over Magna Carta, Prince Louis of France and his army of mercenaries and French soldiers invaded England and allied with English rebels. The prize was the crown of England. Within months Louis had seized control of one-third of the country, including London.\r\n\r\nThis is the first book to cover the bloody events of the invasion, one of the most dramatic but most overlooked episodes of British history. The text vividly describes the campaigns, sieges, battles, and atrocities of the invasion and its colorful leaders â€” Louis the Lion, King John, William Marshal, and the mercenaries Fawkes de BÃ©autÃ© and Eustace the Monk â€” to offer the first detailed military analysis of this epic struggle for England","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ddcbe24c990363dd6722804628e7e2e66aa606","amp;dn":"Blood+Cries+Afar%3A+The+Forgotten+Invasion+of+England+1216","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7ddcbe24c990363dd6722804628e7e2e66aa606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,221,203,226,76,153,3,99,221,103,34,128,70,40,231,226,230,106,166,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
