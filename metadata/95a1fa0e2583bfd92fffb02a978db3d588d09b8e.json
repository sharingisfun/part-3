For the first time ever, resulting from closed-door interviews between the author and Mossad agents, informants, and spymasters, as well as classified documents and top-secret sources, the truth about the Mossad is about to be revealed. From the Mossad agent in the Clinton White House who enabled Israel to call the shots in the ongoing Middle East peace process to the nuclear secrets smuggled out of the U.S. and used to jump-start Israel's own atomic weapons program, Gideon's Spies reveals the Mossad as it truly is: brilliant, ruthless, flawed, but ultimately awesome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a1fa0e2583bfd92fffb02a978db3d588d09b8e","amp;dn":"Gideon%27s+Spies%3A+The+Secret+History+of+the+Mossad+%5BiDeusEx%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a1fa0e2583bfd92fffb02a978db3d588d09b8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,161,250,14,37,131,191,217,47,255,176,42,151,141,179,213,136,208,155,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
