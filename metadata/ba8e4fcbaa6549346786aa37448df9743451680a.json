I thought it was time to have some of the friends that I love &amp; the artists that I admire come into my studio &amp; sing with me live, the way we did it in the old days,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explains Ray Charles on the genesis of Genius Loves Company. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All the guests brought their own magic to each song. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we wanted &amp; thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what we got.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ RayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s confidence is understandable. Genius Loves Company stands as a remarkable hallmark in a remarkable career. In his brilliant debut for Concord Records, Ray sings a dozen duets with a dazzling array of guest artists from virtually every genre, who have won a combined 79 GRAMMYr Awards. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We cover it all,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ray adds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“from country to R&amp;B, pop, rock &amp; blues. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never let them put me in a little box, &amp; this CD expresses that open feeling. A beautiful song is a beautiful song-and to sing with so many beautiful singers is a blessing from God.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTracklist:-\n\n01. Here We Go Again (duet with Norah Jones) 3:59\n02.
