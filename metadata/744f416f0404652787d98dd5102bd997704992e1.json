After burying the loot, they find their way to a surreal town full of cowboys who drink an awful lot of coffee. The townspeople are hostile to the outsiders at first, but seem to accept them once they've killed a couple of people. After a while, a mysterious man named Dade arrives, who seems to have unpleasant business to settle with the robbers. A free-for-all shoot-em-up ensues..\n\nInfo\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 86min\nGenre: Western, Comedy, Action\nRelease Year: 1987\nDirector: Alex cox\n\nVideo\nFormat: AVI\nCodec: x264\nFile size: 899 MiB\nResolution: 1360 x 720\nFrame Rate: 25 fps\n\nAudio\nCodec: English, AC3\nBit Rate: 224kbps\nChannels: 2ch\nSample Rate:48khz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:744f416f0404652787d98dd5102bd997704992e1","amp;dn":"Straight+To+Hell+%5B1987%5D+%5BDVDRip%5D+%5Bx264%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"744f416f0404652787d98dd5102bd997704992e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,79,65,111,4,4,101,39,135,217,141,213,16,43,217,151,112,73,146,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
