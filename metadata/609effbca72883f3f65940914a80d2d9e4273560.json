Celebi, in an attempt to stop \nthese events from transpiring, travels back in time to our present. In the present, however,\n Ash Ketchum encounters a shady figure alike in appearance to himself, but differing in that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s evil.\n\n----------------------------------\nPlot:\n===================\n  Ash, Pikachu, and company stop by in a house where they intend to watch a match of t\nhe PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon Baccer World Cup between the evolutionary line of Elekid and Beldum.\n Brock explains about what the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon Baccer World Cup is, and an image of a mysterious man \nshows up after the match in the TV and exhibits its team formed by a Raikou, Entei, and Suicune,\n that quickly drags the spinning-top shaped object in the floating pyramid, making the gang want \nto see them live. Recognizing them as legendary PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon, Team Rocket starts getting excited that \nthey should capture them. A Nurse Joy then shows up, saying that she is also very excited for the\n match. Ash then proposes to reach Crown City before the day's end, where the next PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon Baccer\n World Cup will be held.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zoroark rests in a large carrier plane, and Zorua fumbles out of Zoroark's hair,\n who seems to be the child of Zoroark. Suddenly, an automatic door opens, where Zoroark and her \nson find themselves face-to-face with Raikou, Entei and Suicune. Behind them, the business man \nGrings Kodai and his assistant, Rowena, stay in a chamber. Rowena tells Kodai that the final \nadjustments are ready. Kodai then tests Zoroark's use of illusions by commanding the illusions \nof the legendary PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon to attack Zoroark. Zorua tries to attack Raikou, but Zoroark stops him \nand puts him into her hair for safety. Kodai asks Zoroark if she cherishes her son that much, but \nZoroark quickly transforms into Raikou. Zoroark fills the area with thunderclouds that ascends \nto Kodai and Rowena. At the same time, Kodai activates an illusion in his bracelet. \nThe thunderclouds penetrate them, but Kodai reveals that he and Rowena are illusions, \nand that the cameras were also fooled by the illusions.\n\n=========================================================================\n\n Cast (in alphabetical order) \n\n Michael McConnohie ...
