In fact, even discounting the four Curtom tracks that spill over onto disc two, the first disc's 26 selections constitute far and away the most extensive Impressions best-of on the market. Toss in ten of the most essential Mayfield solo tracks, and the result is breathtaking in its progression from romantic soul, often informed by doo wop and gospel, to expansive, ambitiously arranged funk jams. It's also fascinating to hear Mayfield's social conscience emerging as the '60s progress, since he was among the very first R&amp;B artists to explore political issues in his music, paving the way for countless others to do so during the '70s. If you're only interested in Mayfield's funkier solo work, Rhino's The Very Best of Curtis Mayfield features all but one of the solo tracks included here, plus several more. But in order to fully grasp Mayfield's impact on R&amp;B and his talent as a singer, songwriter, musician, and producer, The Anthology 1961-1977 is absolutely essential. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://livedoor.blogimg.jp/osugi65/imgs/4/4/4435b381.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://livedoor.blogimg.jp/osugi65/imgs/4/4/4435b381.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n&quot;Gypsy Woman&quot;\n&quot;Grow Closer Together&quot;\n&quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;\n&quot;Little Young Lover&quot;\n&quot;Minstrel and Queen&quot;\n&quot;I'm the One Who Loves You&quot;\n&quot;Sad Sad Girl and Boy&quot;\n&quot;It's All Right&quot;\n&quot;Talking About My Baby&quot;\n&quot;I'm So Proud&quot;\n&quot;Keep on Pushing&quot;\n&quot;You Must Believe Me&quot;\n&quot;See the Real Me&quot;\n&quot;Amen&quot;\n&quot;I've Been Trying&quot;\n&quot;People Get Ready&quot;\n&quot;It's Hard to Believe&quot;\n&quot;Woman's Got Soul&quot;\n&quot;Meeting Over Yonder&quot;\n&quot;I Need You&quot;\n&quot;You've Been Cheatin'&quot;\n&quot;Man Oh Man&quot;\n&quot;Can't Satisfy&quot;\n&quot;We're a Winner&quot;\n&quot;I Loved and I Lost&quot;\n&quot;We're Rolling On (Part One)&quot;\n\nDisc two\n\n&quot;Fool For You&quot;\n&quot;This is My Country&quot;\n&quot;Choice of Colors&quot;\n&quot;Check Out Your Mind&quot;\n&quot;Move On Up&quot; - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below, We're All Going to Go&quot; - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;The Makings of You&quot; - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;Beautiful Brother of Mine&quot; - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;Freddie's Dead&quot; - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;Superfly&quot; - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;Pusherman&quot; - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;So In Love&quot; - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;Only You Babe&quot; (single edit) - Curtis Mayfield\n&quot;Do Do Wap is Strong in Here&quot; (single edit) - Curtis Mayfield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eae4af5ba7951db54be0b04aad944fdebcfd6a5","amp;dn":"Curtis+Mayfield+-+The+Anthology+1961-1977+%5BMp3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eae4af5ba7951db54be0b04aad944fdebcfd6a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,174,74,245,186,121,81,219,84,190,11,4,170,217,68,253,235,207,214,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
