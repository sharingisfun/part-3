Christopherson had been a founder of Psychic TV and member of Throbbing Gristle. For over twenty years Coil had been at the forefront of European experimentalism and electronic music. Peter Christopherson has decided that, with the passing of Jhonn Balance, Coil cannot continue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a92c519a7efa113d45e076eeaae4e0323a12e06","amp;dn":"Coil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a92c519a7efa113d45e076eeaae4e0323a12e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,146,197,25,167,239,161,19,212,94,7,110,234,174,78,3,35,161,46,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
