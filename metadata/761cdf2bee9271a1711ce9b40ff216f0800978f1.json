As a result, the book provides a brief introduction to those aspects of the Mathematica software program most useful to students. The second edition of this well loved book is completely rewritten for Mathematica 6 including coverage of the new dynamic interface elements, several hundred exercises and a new chapter on programming. This book can be used in a variety of courses, from precalculus to linear algebra. Used as a supplementary text it will aid in bridging the gap between the mathematics in the course and Mathematica. In addition to its course use, this book will serve as an excellent tutorial for those wishing to learn Mathematica and brush up on their mathematics at the same time.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:761cdf2bee9271a1711ce9b40ff216f0800978f1","amp;dn":"The+Student%27s+Introduction+to+Mathematica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"761cdf2bee9271a1711ce9b40ff216f0800978f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,28,223,43,238,146,113,161,113,28,233,180,15,242,22,240,128,9,120,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
