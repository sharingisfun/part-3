He went on stage at about 2.00 pm on Sunday, August 17th 1969.\n\nCocker's backing band at that time was the superb Grease Band. Cocker and the Grease band had just completed a U.S. tour supporting their first album and had returned home for some rest when the entire lot of them were brought back to the States to play at Woodstock and made rock history with a cover of a Beatles tune Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Woodstock set closer &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;.\n\nThe 11-song show* included six cuts from the debut album, two from his then upcoming album (including a dynamite cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Dear Landlord&quot; that opened the gig), a stellar reading of Ashford &amp; Simpson's &quot;I Don't Need No Doctor,&quot; and &quot;Something to Say,&quot; an original that didn't appear officially on one of his own albums until 1973. From that opening Dylan cut throughout his 62-minute outing, Cocker never really let up in energy or graciousness toward the crowd. The ballads, such as &quot;Do I Still Figure in Your Life,&quot; are delivered with soul and as much fire as harder-driving rhythm &amp; blues-inflected numbers such as &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot; and &quot;Hitchcock Railway.&quot; The summation of the show is that utterly in-the-red performance of the Beatles' &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends,&quot; well-known to fans of Cocker and the Woodstock musical and cinematic offerings. \n\nShortly after Cocker's gig a heavy thunderstorm washed over the festival and everything was brought to stop for several hours.\n\n\nJoe Cocker\n\nLive at Woodstock\n\n1969\n\n \nCD / 2009 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1\tDear Landlord\t\n\n2\tSomething's Coming On\t\n\n3\tDo I Still Figure In Your Life\t\n\n4\tFeelin' Alright\t\n\n5\tJust Like A Woman\t\n\n6\tLet's Go Get Stoned\t\n\n7\tI Don't Need No Doctor\n\n8\tI Shall Be Released\t\n\n9\tHitchcock Railway\t\n\n10\tSomething To Say\n\n11\tWith A Little Help From My Friends\t\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJoe Cocker - vocals \n\nand\n\nThe Grease Band:\n\nHenry McCullough - guitar, backing vocals \n\nAlan Spenner - bass, backing vocals \n\nChris Stainton - keyboards, backing vocals \n\nBruce Rowland - drums \n\nBobby Torres - congas \n\n\n*Note: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Live at WoodstockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the complete Joe Cocker set, minus the two Grease Band warm-up songs, TrafficÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring&quot; &amp; &quot;40,000 Headmen&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e78872bc867d194383380dc502c0f48c1f00bb7","amp;dn":"Joe+Cocker+-+Live+at+Woodstock+1969+%2F+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e78872bc867d194383380dc502c0f48c1f00bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,120,135,43,200,103,209,148,56,51,128,220,80,44,15,72,193,240,11,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
