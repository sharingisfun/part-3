Meanwhile, Hanna is at the hospital frantically trying to see her son, Benny, and speak to doctors about his condition. While at the hospital, Hanna meets Michael and is moved by his grief. Michael's granddaughter, Lizzie, was, like Benny, also a victim of a hit-and-run. Later, the Rev. Waters reveals that the same driver who hit Benny also hit little Lizzie, who later dies in surgery.
