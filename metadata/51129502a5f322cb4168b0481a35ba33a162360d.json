In charge of the workshops were tutor Aniruddha Das and youth worker John Pandit, also a noted DJ; with one of their students, a 15-year-old Bengali rapper named Deedar Zaman, they soon formed a sound system that they called the Asian Dub Foundation. After each adopted an alias -- bassist/tabla player Das became Dr. Das, Pandit became Pandit G, and Zaman became Master D -- they gradually evolved into a working band with the 1994 addition of former Higher Intelligence Agency guitarist Steve Chandra Savale, an innovative performer known for tuning his strings to one note like a sitar, turning up the distortion unit, and playing his instrument with a knife, earning him the nickname &quot;Chandrasonic.&quot; Emerging in the midst of considerable anti-Asian violence throughout Britain, the Foundation's early demos landed them a contract with Nation Records, and they recorded their debut EP, Conscious, in 1994.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art/ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.New London Eye\n02.Urgency Frequency\n03.London To Tokyo\n04.A History Of Now\n05.Spirit In The Machine\n06.Where's All The Money Gone\n07.In Another Life\n08.Power Of 10\n09.Future Proof\n10.This Land Is Not For Sale\n11.Temple Siren\n12.Lights Out (Bonus Track )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51129502a5f322cb4168b0481a35ba33a162360d","amp;dn":"Asian+Dub+Foundation+-+A+History+Of+Now+%282011%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51129502a5f322cb4168b0481a35ba33a162360d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,18,149,2,165,243,34,203,65,104,176,72,26,53,186,51,161,98,54,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
