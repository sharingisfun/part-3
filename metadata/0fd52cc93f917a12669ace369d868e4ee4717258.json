An exceptional swimmer, Coralie appears as the Mermaid in her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“museum,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ alongside performers like the Wolfman, the Butterfly Girl, and a one-hundred-year-old turtle. One night Coralie stumbles upon a striking young man taking pictures of moonlit trees in the woods off the Hudson River.\n\nThe dashing photographer is Eddie Cohen, a Russian immigrant who has run away from his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lower East Side Orthodox community and his job as a tailorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apprentice. When Eddie photographs the devastation on the streets of New York following the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, he becomes embroiled in the suspicious mystery behind a young womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance and ignites the heart of Coralie.\n\nWith its colorful crowds of bootleggers, heiresses, thugs, and idealists, New York itself becomes a riveting character as Hoffman weaves her trademark magic, romance, and masterful storytelling to unite Coralie and Eddie in a sizzling, tender, and moving story of young love in tumultuous times. The Museum of Extraordinary Things is Alice Hoffman at her most spellbinding.\n\nGenre: Fiction, General Fiction/Classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd52cc93f917a12669ace369d868e4ee4717258","amp;dn":"The+Museum+of+Extraordinary+Things+by+Alice+Hoffman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd52cc93f917a12669ace369d868e4ee4717258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,213,44,201,63,145,122,18,102,154,206,54,157,134,142,78,228,113,114,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
