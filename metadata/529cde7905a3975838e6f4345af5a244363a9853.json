The first gig of any tour is always a slightly fraught affair; anything that can go wrong probably will. Gear will futz, fingers and feet will lie to their owners and the sound could well be unsound as the entire crew get to grips with the task of presenting nearly two hours of challenging music.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably perhaps then, this version of Discipline is not an assertive statement but more a gentle easing in, marking out their territory. A slow burning version of Vrooom sounds more confident, especially on the remorseless spiraling coda, though like Frame By Frame which follows, is not without the occasional wobble.\r\n\r\nThe band audibly settle into the gig on Dinosaur and you can hear them really enjoying a high-rolling Red, and the mutant-free-form jazz sextet reading of Thrak. People represents something of a â€œrock outâ€ moment which is no bad thing; Belewâ€™s splendidly squerning solo is especially tasty. Trey Gunnâ€™s spectral notes are a highlight of a driving Talking Drum, and the band really get their collective teeth into LTIA big time.\r\n\r\nOverall verdict: a band in the process of arriving but not quite all at the same time.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n01 - Discipline\r\n02 - VROOOM\r\n03 - Coda: Marine 475\r\n04 - Frame By Frame\r\n05 - Dinosaur\r\n06 - Red\r\n07 - One Time\r\n08 - B'Boom\r\n09 - THRAK\r\n10 - Improv Two Sticks\r\n11 - Elephant Talk\r\n12 - Matte Kudasai\r\n13 - Sex, Sleep, Eat, Drink, Dream\r\n14 - People\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n01 - VROOOM VROOOM\r\n02 - Sleepless\r\n03 - Indiscipline\r\n04 - Prism\r\n05 - The Talking Drum\r\n06 - Larks' Tongues In Aspic Pt II\r\n07 - Heartbeat\r\n08 - Walking On Air\r\n\r\nÂ© 1995, 2010 Discipline Global Mobile / King Crimson\r\n{DGM 16/44 Official Digital Download} (dgmlive.com) \r\n\r\nAudio Source: Dat Soundboard\r\nDGM Audio Quality Rating: 5 stars\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nAdrian Belew - Guitar, Voice, Words\r\nBill Bruford - Acoustic and Electronic Percussions\r\nRobert Fripp - Guitar\r\nTrey Gunn - Touch Guitar, Voice\r\nTony Levin - Basses, Chapman Stick, Voice\r\nPat Mastelotto - Acoustic and Electronic Percussions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore King Crimson DGM Official Digital Download:\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Crimson - Teatro Smeraldo, Milan, Italy - May 02, 1995 (2010):\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/14602698/King_Crimson_-_Teatro_Smeraldo__Milan__Italy_-_May_02__1995","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:529cde7905a3975838e6f4345af5a244363a9853","amp;dn":"King+Crimson+-+Kulturhaus%2C+Dornbirn%2C+Austria+-+May+01%2C+1995+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"529cde7905a3975838e6f4345af5a244363a9853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,156,222,121,5,163,151,88,56,230,244,52,90,245,162,68,54,58,152,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
