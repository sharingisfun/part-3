The album is considered a blend of house, techno, acid and funk.[1][2] It is noted for inciting interest in French touch music with several artists following the style.[3] Homework features the hit singles &quot;Around the World&quot; and &quot;Da Funk&quot;.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Ed Potton - Solely responsible for the current interest in all things funky and French, the Daft Punk boys, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, can do no wrong. Breaking into the club scene with their own blend of techno-disco in 1995, their debut album is the 80's electro-funk record of your dreams. Influenced by old school Chicago house and Detroit minimalist techno (all name checked on &quot;Teachers&quot;), Homework ranges from the warped electro that has become their trademark on &quot;Around the World&quot; and &quot;Da Funk&quot;, to banging acid techno on &quot;Rollin'and Scratchin'&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot;. An album so funky it could make James Brown cry, and with so much bite you can feel it at the back of your throat. \nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Daftendirekt\n[02] WDPK 83.7 FM\n[03] Revolution 909\n[04] Da Funk\n[05] Phoenix\n[06] Fresh\n[07] Around The World\n[08] Rollin' &amp; Scratchin'\n[09] Teachers\n[10] High Fidelity\n[11] Rock 'n Roll\n[12] Oh Yeah\n[13] Burnin'\n[14] Indo Silver Club\n[15] Alive\n[16] Funk Ad\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 01h:13m:46s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 177mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200 dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Electronica Dance\nRelease Date\t&gt; 20 January 1997 [UK] 25 March 1997 [US]\nRecord Company\t&gt; Virgin Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.daftpunk.com\n\t&gt;\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk \n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/d/daftpunk.html \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.bebo.com/daftpunk \n\t&gt; http://www.ilike.com/artist/Daft+Punk \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/daftpunk \n\t&gt;\t&gt;[Around The World]\n\t&gt;[Daft Hand ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Around The World]\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:280adb351ff2a9cd82413cbaf040390d4cc876e4","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+Homework+-+Daft+Punk+177mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"280adb351ff2a9cd82413cbaf040390d4cc876e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,10,219,53,31,242,169,205,130,65,60,186,240,64,57,13,76,200,118,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
