The Siren \nNotorious Nora Sutherlin is famous for her delicious works of erotica, each one more popular with readers than the last. But her latest manuscript is differentÃ¢â‚¬â€more serious, more personalÃ¢â‚¬â€and she's sure it'll be her breakout bookÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if it ever sees the light of day.\nZachary Easton holds Nora's fate in his well-manicured hands. The demanding British editor agrees to handle the book on one condition: he wants complete control. Nora must rewrite the entire novel to his exacting standardsÃ¢â‚¬â€in six weeksÃ¢â‚¬â€or it's no deal. Nora's grueling writing sessions with Zach are drainingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and shockingly arousing. And a dangerous former lover has her wondering which is more torturousÃ¢â‚¬â€staying away from himÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or returning to his bed? Nora thought she knew everything about being pushed to your limits. But in a world where passion is pain, nothing is ever that simple.\n\n2. The Angel \nNo safe word can protect the heart\nInfamous erotica author and accomplished dominatrix Nora Sutherlin is doing something utterly out of character: hiding. While her longtime lover, SÃƒÂ¸renÃ¢â‚¬â€whose fetishes, if exposed, would be his ruinÃ¢â‚¬â€is under scrutiny pending a major promotion, Nora's lying low and away from temptation in the lap of luxury. Her host, the wealthy and uninhibited Griffin Fiske, is thrilled to have Nora stay at his country estate, especially once he meets her traveling companion. Young, inexperienced and angelically beautiful, Michael has become Nora's protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, and this summer with Griffin is going to be his training, where the hazing never ends. But while her flesh is willing, Nora's mind is wandering. To thoughts of SÃƒÂ¸ren, her master, under investigation by a journalist with an ax to grind. And to another man from Nora's past, whose hold on her is less bruising, but whose secrets are no less painful. It's a summer that will prove the old adage: love hurts.\n\n3. The Prince \nTwo worlds of wealth and passion call to Nora Sutherlin and, whichever one she chooses, it will be the hardest decision she will ever have to make. Unless someone makes it for herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Wes Railey is the object of Nora's tamest yet most maddening fantasies, and the one man she can't forget. He's young. He's wonderful. He's also thoroughbred royalty and, reuniting with him in Kentucky, she's in his world now. But this infamous New York dominatrix is no simpering Southern belle, and Nora's dream of fitting into Wesley's world is perpetually at odds with the relentlessly seductive pull of SÃƒÂ¸renÃ¢â‚¬â€her owner, her lover, the forever she cannot have. At least, not completely. Meanwhile Nora's associate Kingsley Edge is only too happy to take her place at SÃƒÂ¸ren's feet during her hiatus. SÃƒÂ¸ren is the only man Kingsley has ever loved, and their dark, shared history has forged a bond that neither the yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€nor SÃƒÂ¸ren's love for NoraÃ¢â‚¬â€can break. But a new threat from an old adversary is forcing Kingsley to confront the past, reminding him that he must keep his friends close, and his enemies closer.\n\n(Bonus)Submit to Desire\nCharlotte Brand is tired of dull boyfriends and boring sex. Kingsley Edge, who owns clubs rumored to supply more than just cocktails, seems just the man to revive her: intense, sophisticatedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and looking for a submissive he can train for an elite client. Charlotte is seduced by the offerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and by Kingsley himself. Soon they are engaged in a series of lessons that test her darkest desires. But when their training is over, will Charlotte be ready to let him go? \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd66fdbb938f57748ea02466cccdebe9a5c08f0a","amp;dn":"The+Original+Sinners+Series+by+Tiffany+Reisz+%283+Books+%2B+Bonus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd66fdbb938f57748ea02466cccdebe9a5c08f0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,102,253,187,147,143,87,116,142,160,36,102,204,205,235,233,165,192,143,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
