ArchieÃ¢â‚¬â€working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his beltÃ¢â‚¬â€is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin. When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie's car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel. \n\nEpic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teeth is the story of two North London familiesÃ¢â‚¬â€one headed by Archie, the other by Archie's best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal. Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair. Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for &quot;no problem&quot;). Samad Ã¢â‚¬â€devoutly Muslim, hopelessly &quot;foreign&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€ weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union. They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd. The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire's worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.\n\nZadie Smith's dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant cafÃƒÂ©, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute. A winning debut in every respect, White Teeth marks the arrival of a wondrously talented writer who takes on the big themes Ã¢â‚¬â€faith, race, gender, history, and cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€ and triumphs.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Listed in GQ Magazine's list &quot;The 21 Books from the 21st Century Every Man Should Read.&quot; I couldn't find this one on TPB, so here it is.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d3489ade93df8804db7f1ff80807bb0049264ba","amp;dn":"White+Teeth+by+Zadie+Smith+ePub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d3489ade93df8804db7f1ff80807bb0049264ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,52,137,173,233,61,248,128,77,183,241,255,128,128,123,176,4,146,100,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
