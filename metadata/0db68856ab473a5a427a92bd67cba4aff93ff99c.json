In presenting their case, the authors take the reader from the workshop of Filippo Lippi in Florence to Urbino, capital of Federico da MontefeltroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s duchy in the region of the Marches. It was a road most memorably traveled by Piero della Francesca, who worked in Florence in 1439 and became FedericoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite artist. This book shows that other lesser known artists like Fra Carnevale also took the same path.\n\nAmong the many other artistsÃ¢â‚¬â€painters and sculptorsÃ¢â‚¬â€crucial to Fra CarnevaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formation and discussed in this volume are Domenico Veneziano, Luca della Robbia, Pesellino, and Agostino di Duccio. Essays by Keith Christiansen, Andrea De Marchi, and Matteo Ceriana and a documentary appendix by Andrea Di Lorenzo and Matteo Mazzalupi transform our knowledge of this exciting moment in the history of Renaissance art","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db68856ab473a5a427a92bd67cba4aff93ff99c","amp;dn":"From+Filippo+Lippi+to+Piero+della+Francesca+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db68856ab473a5a427a92bd67cba4aff93ff99c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,182,136,86,171,71,58,90,66,122,146,189,103,203,164,175,249,63,249,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
