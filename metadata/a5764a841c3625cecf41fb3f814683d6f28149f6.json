In David Jeffries' review for AllMusic, he praised the album for being &quot;filled with classics and desirable extras&quot; but questioned the album's &quot;odd one song-per-album rule&quot; before finishing the review by commenting that &quot;this is a triumph of format and the band's longevity, but not necessarily a knockout introduction&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc 1 \t\n\nNo. \tTitle \tOriginal album \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Nothin' to Lose&quot;   \tKiss \t3:22\n2. \t&quot;Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll&quot;   \tHotter Than Hell \t2:13\n3. \t&quot;C'mon and Love Me&quot;   \tDressed to Kill \t2:54\n4. \t&quot;Rock and Roll All Nite [Live]&quot;   \tAlive! \t3:59\n5. \t&quot;God of Thunder [Demo]&quot;   \tThe Box Set \t2:54\n6. \t&quot;Beth&quot;   \tDestroyer \t2:44\n7. \t&quot;Hard Luck Woman&quot;   \tRock and Roll Over \t3:31\n8. \t&quot;Reputation [Demo]&quot;   \tPreviously unreleased \t5:38\n9. \t&quot;Christine Sixteen&quot;   \tLove Gun \t3:09\n10. \t&quot;Shout It Out Loud [Live]&quot;   \tAlive II \t3:25\n11. \t&quot;Strutter Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ78&quot;   \tDouble Platinum \t3:40\n12. \t&quot;You Matter to Me&quot;   \tPeter Criss \t3:13\n13. \t&quot;Radioactive&quot;   \tGene Simmons \t3:50\n14. \t&quot;New York Groove&quot;   \tAce Frehley \t2:59\n15. \t&quot;Hold Me, Touch Me (Think of Me When We're Apart)&quot;   \tPaul Stanley \t3:37\n16. \t&quot;I Was Made for Lovin' You [Single Edit]&quot;   \tDynasty \t3:59\n17. \t&quot;Shandi&quot;   \tUnmasked \t3:34\n18. \t&quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;   \tMusic from &quot;The Elder&quot; \t2:36\n19. \t&quot;I Love It Loud&quot;   \tCreatures of the Night \t4:12\n20. \t&quot;Down on Your Knees&quot;   \tKillers \t3:26\n21. \t&quot;Lick It Up&quot;   \tLick It Up \t3:52\n22. \t&quot;Heaven's on Fire&quot;   \tAnimalize \t3:16\n\nDisc 2 \t\n\nNo. \tTitle \tOriginal album \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Tears Are Falling&quot;   \tAsylum \t3:52\n2. \t&quot;Reason to Live&quot;   \tCrazy Nights \t3:58\n3. \t&quot;LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Put the X in Sex&quot;   \tSmashes, Thrashes &amp; Hits \t3:47\n4. \t&quot;Forever [Remix]&quot;   \tHot in the Shade \t3:50\n5. \t&quot;God Gave Rock 'N' Roll to You II&quot;   \tRevenge \t5:19\n6. \t&quot;Unholy [Live]&quot;   \tAlive III \t3:31\n7. \t&quot;Do You Love Me?
