Now you can enjoy all your favorite comfort foods without sacrificing the terrific health benefits of a grain-free, dairy-free diet.\n\nWhen Chef and caterer Anna Conrad was asked to provide paleo recipes for a fitness groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 28-day paleo challenge, she was a little skeptical. Could an athleteÃ¢â‚¬â€or even an average personÃ¢â‚¬â€really maintain a balanced body without any grains or dairy? Before agreeing to the job, she decided to follow the diet for two weeks to see how she felt. In that short amount of time, she lost eight pounds without feeling hungry or deprived, and her blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol all stayed within healthy limits. She gladly provided the recipes and now offers a paleo menu as a regular part of her catering business. In this book, she offers delicious comfort food recipes, including:\n\nChicken Pot Pie\nCreamed Spinach\nMeatloaf\nRueben Sandwich\nShrimp Bisque\nSpaghetti Carbonara\nAnd more!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27ef5d38daa3ae78ed71a823929d9c70abf71402","amp;dn":"The+Paleo+Comfort+Foods+Bible+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27ef5d38daa3ae78ed71a823929d9c70abf71402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,239,93,56,218,163,174,120,237,113,168,35,146,157,156,112,171,247,20,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
