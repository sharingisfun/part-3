With a special gene that endows them with inventiveness the rest of us only wish we had?\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest scientific research, thatâ€™s hardly the case at all. In turns out anyone can be creative. You just have to know how to think creatively.\r\n\r\nIn todayâ€™s hyperactive worldâ€”where bold new challenges can seem to bring about the same stale answersâ€”creative thinking is more important than ever. And itâ€™s about more than just writing a novel or composing a piece of music. Creative thinking involves taking a broader, more imaginative approach to analyzing and solving the everyday challenges we all face, whether in the office or at home.\r\n\r\nBy training yourself to become a more creative thinker, you can\r\n\r\ndevelop and bring to fruition new answers to problems that once seemed daunting or unsolvable;\r\nbecome more persuasive in how you present and sell your ideas;\r\navoid tired solutions in favor of novel ones with the potential for even greater success;\r\nstrengthen your ability to lead teams and organizations; and\r\nreach new levels of satisfaction and fulfillment in your daily life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9a8f6f84ce318f3938a7ba8b05ef81d8b772836","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+Creative+Thinker%26rsquo%3Bs+Toolkit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9a8f6f84ce318f3938a7ba8b05ef81d8b772836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,168,246,248,76,227,24,243,147,138,123,168,176,94,248,29,139,119,40,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
