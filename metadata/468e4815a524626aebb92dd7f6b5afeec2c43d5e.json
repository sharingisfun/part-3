A good trauma surgeon is a surgeon who knows how to perform abdominal, vascular, thoracic, urologic, gynecologic, and orthopaedic procedures and is able to repair multiple traumatic injuries in the best sequence possible. In this second volume the focus is exclusively on thoracic and abdominal trauma, with coverage of injuries to all regions. The surgical techniques employed in managing such trauma are carefully described with the aid of high-quality illustrations. Exploratory surgery (via either laparotomy or laparoscopy), damage control surgery, and definitive surgery are all fully covered, and attention is drawn to important technical tips and tricks.\n\nThe volume will be a handy pocket guide for trainee surgeons who are beginning to deal with severe multiple trauma patients, as well as for all general or specialty surgeons and professionals (including scrub nurses and theatre staff) who are involved in trauma care and wish to keep abreast of developments in this complex field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:468e4815a524626aebb92dd7f6b5afeec2c43d5e","amp;dn":"Trauma+Surgery%2C+Vol+2-+Thoracic+and+Abdominal+Trauma+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"468e4815a524626aebb92dd7f6b5afeec2c43d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,142,72,21,165,36,98,106,235,185,45,215,246,181,175,238,194,196,61,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
