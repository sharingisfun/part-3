Though confronted by the same market variables, those clients often make very different choices with very different results. Here, Chen argues that it's usually not the data that affects investor decision-making as much as the way investors themselves think. In NeuroInvesting, Chen argues that investors can change the way they think in order to change the way they invest. She presents four elements that affect investor decision-making and reveals how investors can rewire their brains to make better investing decisions for better returns.\nUses neuroscience to explain how successful investors think different\nWritten by an experienced investment advisor who works at one of Australia's premier retail brokers\nExplains investing using real-world stories about investors from an advisor's perspective\nWhen it comes to investing, how you think has a huge impact on how you make investing decisions. Based on the real science of how people think, NeuroInvesting offers every investor a chance to change the way they invest by changing the way they think.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7f96f8d427c9d50ebe4b077a9e0d633abf70db2","amp;dn":"NeuroInvesting+Build+a+New+Investing+Brain+by+Wai-Yee+Chen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7f96f8d427c9d50ebe4b077a9e0d633abf70db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,249,111,141,66,124,157,80,235,228,176,119,169,224,214,51,171,247,13,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
