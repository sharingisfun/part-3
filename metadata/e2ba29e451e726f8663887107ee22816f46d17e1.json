This approach will give you a solid foundation for writing useful, correct, maintainable, and efficient code.\nProgramming with TodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s C++\nThe book is an introduction to programming in general, including object-oriented programming and generic programming. It is also a solid introduction to the C++ programming language, one of the most widely used languages for real-world software. The book presents modern C++ programming techniques from the start, introducing the C++ standard library to simplify programming tasks.\nFor BeginnersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“And Anyone Who Wants to Learn Something New\nThe book is primarily designed for people who have never programmed before, and it has been tested with more than 1,000 first-year university students. However, practitioners and advanced students will gain new insight and guidance by seeing how a recognized master approaches the elements of his art.\nProvides a Broad View\nThe first half of the book covers a wide range of essential concepts, design and programming techniques, language features, and libraries. Those will enable you to write programs involving input, output, computation, and simple graphics. The second half explores more specialized topics, such as text processing and testing, and provides abundant reference material. Source code and support supplements are available from the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s website.\n\nAbout the Author\nBjarne Stroustrup is the designer and original implementer of C++, the author of The C++ Programming Language, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual, and The Design and Evolution of C++, and the consulting editor of Addison-Wesley's C++ In-Depth Series. Having previously worked at Bell Labs and AT&amp;T Labs-Research, he currently is the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science Professor at Texas A&amp;M University. The recipient of numerous honors, including the Dr. Dobb's Excellence in Programming Award (2008), Dr. Stroustrup is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, an AT&amp;T Fellow, an AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories Fellow, an IEEE Fellow, and an ACM Fellow. His research interests include distributed systems, simulation, design, programming techniques, software development tools, and programming languages, and he remains actively involved in the ANSI/ISO standardization of C++. Dr. Stroustrup holds an advanced degree from the University of Aarhus in his native Denmark and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cambridge University, England.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ba29e451e726f8663887107ee22816f46d17e1","amp;dn":"Programming%3A+Principles+and+Practice+Using+C%2B%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ba29e451e726f8663887107ee22816f46d17e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,186,41,228,81,231,38,248,102,56,135,16,126,226,40,22,244,109,23,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
