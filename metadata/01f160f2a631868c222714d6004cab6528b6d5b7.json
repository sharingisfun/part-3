The youngest child in an upper-class New York family (her father, Richard Simon, co-founded the Simon &amp; Schuster publishing company), Simon got her start in music as part of a duo with her sister Lucy (who later wrote the music for the Broadway show The Secret Garden). The Simon Sisters had a chart single with &quot;Winkin' Blinkin' and Nod&quot; in April 1964. But Simon's solo debut did not come until the release of her self-titled first album in February 1971. It contained her first solo hit, &quot;That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be,&quot; an anti-marriage song co-written with Jacob Brackman that reached the Top Ten. Simon's second album, Anticipation (November 1971) (which went gold in two years), contained a Top 40 follow-up in the title song, and she won the 1971 Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Her third album, the gold number one No Secrets (November 1972), was produced by Richard Perry and contained the gold number one hit &quot;You're So Vain,&quot; which aroused speculation about its subject. Mick Jagger, one of those suggested, sang backup on the recording. &quot;The Right Thing to Do,&quot; a second single from the album, made the Top 40. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.86% CDDA &amp; 99.84% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tR2 78167\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\n02.One More Time\n03.Anticipation\n04.Legend In Your Own Time\n05.Julie Through The Glass\n06.You're So Vain\n07.We Have No Secrets\n08.The Right Thing To Do\n09.Mockingbird (With James Taylor)\n10.Haven't Got Time For The Pain\n11.Older Sister\n12.Waterfall\n13.Attitude Dancing\n14.In Times When My Head\n15.Nobody Does It Better\n16.You Belong To Me\n17.Devoted To You (With James Taylor)\n18.Boys In The Trees\n19.Vengeance\n20.Come Upstairs\n21.Jesse\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Not A Day Goes By\n02.Why\n03.It Happens Everyday\n04.Orpheus\n05.Come Back Home\n06.Coming Around Again\n07.Give Me All Night (Single Version)\n08.The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of\n09.All I Want Is You\n10.Let The River Run\n11.My Romance\n12.Better Not Tell Her\n13.Love Of My Life\n14.Like A River\n15.Two Little Sisters (Theme From ''Marvin's Room'')\n16.Film Noir\n17.Scar\n18.Actress\n19.Touched By The Sun (Live At Grand Central, 1995)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01f160f2a631868c222714d6004cab6528b6d5b7","amp;dn":"Carly+Simon+-+Anthology+%282002%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01f160f2a631868c222714d6004cab6528b6d5b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,241,96,242,166,49,134,140,34,39,20,214,0,76,171,101,40,182,213,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
