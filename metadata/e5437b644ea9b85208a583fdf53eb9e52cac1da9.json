Born Patricia Holt in Philadelphia on May 24, 1944, she grew up singing in a local Baptist choir, and in 1960 teamed with friend Cindy Birdsong to form a group called the Ordettes. A year later, following the additions of vocalists Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash, the group was rechristened the Blue Belles; with producer Bobby Martin at helm, they scored a Top 20 pop and R&amp;B hit in 1962 with the single &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman,&quot; subsequently hitting the charts in 1964 with renditions of &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone.&quot; \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Lady Marmalade\n02.What Can I Do For You\n03.Are You Lonely\n04.You Turn Me On\n05.Messin' With My Mind\n06.Take The Night Off\n07.Get You Somebody New\n08.Isn't It A Shame\n09.Joy To Have Your Love\n10.I Think About You\n11.You Are My Friend\n12.Teach Me Tonight (Me Gusta Tu Baile)\n13.Quiet Time\n14.It's Alright With Me\n15.Don't Make Your Angel Cry\n16.Come What May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5437b644ea9b85208a583fdf53eb9e52cac1da9","amp;dn":"Patti+Labelle+-+The+Best+Of+Patti+%26+Labelle+1995+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5437b644ea9b85208a583fdf53eb9e52cac1da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,67,123,100,78,169,184,82,8,165,131,253,245,62,185,229,44,172,29,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
