Thurston, Shawn Steiman, &quot;Coffee: A Comprehensive Guide to the Bean, the Beverage, and the Industry&quot;\nISBN: 1442214406 | 2013 | PDF | 424 pages | 16 MB\n\nCoffee: A Comprehensive Guide to the Bean, the Beverage, and the Industry offers a definitive guide to the many rich dimensions of the bean and the beverage around the world. Leading experts from business and academia consider coffeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history, global spread, cultivation, preparation, marketing, and the environmental and social issues surrounding it today. They discuss, for example, the impact of globalization; the many definitions of organic, direct trade, and fair trade; the health of female farmers; the relationships among shade, birds, and coffee; roasting as an art and a science; and where profits are made in the commodity chain. Drawing on interviews and the lives of people working in the businessÃ¢â‚¬â€from pickers and roasters to coffee bar owners and consumersÃ¢â‚¬â€this book brings a compelling human side to the story.\n\nThe authors avoid romanticizing or demonizing any group in the business. They consider basic but widely misunderstood issues such as who adds value to the bean, the constraints of peasant life, and the impact of climate change. Moving beyond simple answers, they represent various participants in the supply chain and a range of opinions about problems and suggested solutions in the industry. Coffee offers a multidimensional examination of a deceptively everyday but extremely complex commodity that remains at the center of many millions of lives. Tracing coffeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey from field to cup, this handbook to one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite beverages is an essential guide for professionals, coffee lovers, and students alike.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6973c7669116c59268da9079d86c3d457ce90145","amp;dn":"Coffee+A+Comprehensive+Guide+to+the+Bean%2C+the+Beverage%2C+and+the+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6973c7669116c59268da9079d86c3d457ce90145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,115,199,102,145,22,197,146,104,218,144,121,216,108,61,69,124,233,1,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
