It explains the underlying mathematics needed to build these schemes, and examines the most common techniques used in attacking them. Illustrated with many examples, the book provides a solid foundation for professionals in government, cloud service providers, and large enterprises using public-key systems to secure their data. It is also useful for those taking the CISSP exam (Certified Information Systems Security Professional).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:896a8a024ff254a16e670bd8d437c71ba919bae3","amp;dn":"Public+Key+Cryptography-+Batten%2C+Wiley+2013+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"896a8a024ff254a16e670bd8d437c71ba919bae3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,106,138,2,79,242,84,161,110,103,11,216,212,55,199,27,169,25,186,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
