The prose is crisp and clear, and within a few pages readers become absorbed in the world that made Alexander, and then the story of how Alexander remade it.\r\n\r\nGreen writes, &quot;Alexander's true genius was as a field-commander: perhaps, taken all in all, the most incomparable general the world has ever seen. His gift for speed, improvisation, variety of strategy; his cool-headedness in a crisis; his ability to extract himself from the most impossible situations; his mastery of terrain; his psychological ability to penetrate the enemy's intentions - all these qualities place him at the very head of the Great Captains of history.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:097d2685def5d73a3f18c15d837ed8715abdb287","amp;dn":"Alexander+of+Macedon%2C+356-323+BC%3A+A+Historical+Biography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"097d2685def5d73a3f18c15d837ed8715abdb287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,125,38,133,222,245,215,58,63,24,193,93,131,126,216,113,90,189,178,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
