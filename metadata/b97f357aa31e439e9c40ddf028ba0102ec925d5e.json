Though the film is entirely fictional, the narrative is presented as a documentary pieced together from amateur footage. The film was produced by the Haxan Films production company.\n\nIt tells the story of three young student filmmakers who get lost in the woods while filming a documentary about the eponymous local legend. After being terrorized by an unseen presence for several days, they mysteriously disappear, one by one. Neither the students nor their bodies are ever found, although their video and sound equipment (along with most of the footage they shot) is eventually recovered.\n\nThe release of the film on 30 July 1999 came after months of publicity, including a ground-breaking campaign by the studio to use the Internet and suggest that the film was a real event. It was very positively received and went on to gross over US$248 million worldwide,making it the most successful independent film ever made up to that point, and the most profitable American film of all time in terms of the ratio of production cost to box office sales.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by Daniel Myrick\nEduardo SÃƒÂ¡nchez \nWritten by Daniel Myrick Eduardo SÃƒÂ¡nchez \nStarring Heather Donahue Joshua Leonard Michael C.
