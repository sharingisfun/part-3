Hao Luo demonstrates the developments of advanced plug-and-play (PnP) process monitoring and control systems for industrial automation processes. With aid of the so-called Youla parameterization, a novel PnP process monitoring and control architecture (PnP-PMCA) with modularized components is proposed. To validate the developments, a case study on an industrial rolling mill benchmark is performed, and the real-time implementation on a laboratory brushless DC motor is presented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df814ac7dcf3ec4e53df829f73a3d989c89b73d2","amp;dn":"Plug-and-Play+Monitoring+and+Performance+Optimization+for+Indust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df814ac7dcf3ec4e53df829f73a3d989c89b73d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,129,74,199,220,243,236,78,83,223,130,159,115,163,217,137,200,155,115,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
