So argues Efraim Karsh in this highly provocative book. Rejecting the conventional Western interpretation of Middle Eastern history as an offshoot of global power politics, Karsh contends that the region's experience is the culmination of long-existing indigenous trends, passions and patterns of behaviour, and that foremost among these is Islam's millenarian imperial tradition. The author explores the history of Islam's imperialism and the persistence of the Ottoman imperialist dream that outlasted World War I to haunt Islamic and Middle Eastern politics to the present day. September 11 can be seen as simply the latest expression of this dream, and such attacks have little to do with U.S. international behaviour or policy in the Middle East, says Karsh. The House of Islam's war for world mastery is traditional, indeed venerable, and it is a quest that is far from over.\n\nAbout the Author\nEfraim Karsh is professor and head of the Mediterranean Studies Programme, KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s College, University of London.\n\nCONTENTS\nList of Maps ix\nIntroduction 1\n1 The Warrior Prophet 10\n2 The Rise and Fall of IslamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s First Empire 23\n3 The Best of Times, the Worst of Times 43\n4 The House of Islam and the House of War 66\n5 The Last Great Islamic Empire 88\n6 The Price of Empire 109\n7 Mishandling the Great Game 119\n8 The Rise of the Arab Imperial Dream 132\n9 An Arab Caesar 149\n10 A Reckoning of Sorts 170\n11 The Tail That Wags the Dog 191\n12 Renewing the Quest for AllahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Empire 212\n13 Bin LadenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Holy War 225\nEpilogue 234\nPostscript: Back to the Future 242\nNotes 251\nNotes Index 273\nIndex 283","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35307fdc2eb4b5d1f5166caba4f20837f3cc1b81","amp;dn":"Islamic+Imperialism+-+A+History+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35307fdc2eb4b5d1f5166caba4f20837f3cc1b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,48,127,220,46,180,181,209,245,22,108,171,164,242,8,55,243,204,27,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
