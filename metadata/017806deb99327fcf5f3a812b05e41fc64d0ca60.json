Hailing from Coventry, England, the same hometown as ska pals the Specials, the Selecter's secret weapon was lead singer Pauline Black, arguably the best lead singer of the ska revival, who gave the jumpy and jittery songs an edge that veered into haunting drama. Although they got off to a roaring start with their debut record, 1980's Too Much Pressure, the second record, Celebrate the Bullet, was a strained follow-up that led to the band's rapid demise. Black spent some time singing solo and eventually re-joined guitarist Neol Davis in a Selecter reunion in the early '90s that has seen them become dance club favorites. According to those attending Selecter shows, the vibe is strong and the music great.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tSka\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Three Minute Hero\n02.Too Much Pressure\n03.Celebrate The Bullet\n04.Bomb Scare\n05.Deep Water\n06.Time Hard\n07.They Make Me Mad\n08.Bristol And Miami\n09.Missing Words\n10.James Bond\n11.On My Radio\n12.The Whisper\n13.Carry Go Bring Home\n14.Murder\n15.Washed Up And Left For Dead\n16.Last Tango In Dub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:017806deb99327fcf5f3a812b05e41fc64d0ca60","amp;dn":"The+Selecter+-+Greatest+Hits+%5BEMI%5D+%281996%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"017806deb99327fcf5f3a812b05e41fc64d0ca60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,120,6,222,185,147,39,252,245,243,168,18,176,94,65,252,100,208,202,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
