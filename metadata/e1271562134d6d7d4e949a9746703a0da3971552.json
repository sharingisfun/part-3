But when ambitious rookie journalist, C.J. Nicholas begins investigating Hunter for tampering with evidence to secure his convictions, the district attorney's perfect record is up for scrutiny. Commencing a risky game of cat and mouse with Hunter, C.J. frames himself as a murder suspect to catch the corrupt D.A. in the act. Romantically involved with C.J. but unaware of his assignment, assistant D.A. Ella Crystal becomes caught between her boss's political ambitions and C.J.'s dangerous expose. As mounting evidence stacks up against both men, Ella's own life becomes threatened when she discovers incriminating proof that puts the fate of both C.J's innocence and Hunter's reputation in her hands","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1271562134d6d7d4e949a9746703a0da3971552","amp;dn":"Beyond+a+Reasonable+Doubt+%282009%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1271562134d6d7d4e949a9746703a0da3971552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,39,21,98,19,77,109,125,78,148,154,151,70,112,58,13,163,151,21,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
