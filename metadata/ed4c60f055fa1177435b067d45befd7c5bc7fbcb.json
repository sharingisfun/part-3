Commonly classified as hard rock or blues rock, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always classified their music as simply &quot;rock and roll&quot;. To date they are one of the highest-grossing bands of all time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor Those About to Rock We Salute You is the eighth Australian and seventh international studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in 1981. The album was a follow-up to their highly successful album Back in Black. For Those About to Rock has sold over four million copies in the US. It would be AC/DC's first and only No. 1 album in the U.S. until the release of Black Ice in October 2008. In their original 1981 review, Rolling Stone magazine declared it to be their best album. In Australia, the album peaked at No. 3 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart.\n\nThe album was the third and final produced for the band by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange.\n\nThe name of the album was inspired by a book Angus Young read, entitled For Those About to Die, We Salute You, about Roman gladiators. The gladiators' final words to the emperor were &quot;Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or, &quot;Hail Emperor, we who are about to die, salute you&quot;. The album was re-released in 2008 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4c60f055fa1177435b067d45befd7c5bc7fbcb","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+For+Those+About+To+Rock...+%5B1981%5D%5B2008%5D%5BJPN+RMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4c60f055fa1177435b067d45befd7c5bc7fbcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,76,96,240,85,250,17,119,67,91,6,125,69,190,253,124,91,199,251,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
