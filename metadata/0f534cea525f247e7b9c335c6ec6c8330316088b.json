He is one of the members of the highly successful group IAM, as well as a major solo artist. With his brother Faf Larage (Raphael Mussard), he also is a member of the group La Garde.\n\n\nMussard was born in Marseille on 11 March 1966, with Malagasy and Reunionnais origins. In 1988, he met Akhenaton, with whom he formed IAM. Mussard adopted the stage name Shurik'n Chang-Ti, reflecting his interest in Oriental culture and his background in martial arts, such as judo, karate and kung fu. IAM released its first album, De la Planete Mars, in 1990.\n\nAfter three albums with IAM, Shurik'n decided to start pursuing a solo career with his 1998 album OÃƒÂ¹ je vis. The album debuted atop the French album chart.\n\nFrom Wiki\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shurik%27n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shurik%27n&lt;/a&gt; (English) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shurik%27n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shurik%27n&lt;/a&gt; (French)\n---------------------------\n\n\n320 kbps\n\n16 Tracks - 2002 Re-issue\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Shurikn-O%C3%B9-Je-Vis/release/1370559&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Shurikn-O%C3%B9-Je-Vis/release/1370559&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNot my original content\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f534cea525f247e7b9c335c6ec6c8330316088b","amp;dn":"Shurik%27n+-+Ou+Je+Vis+%5B1998%5D+%282000+Reissue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f534cea525f247e7b9c335c6ec6c8330316088b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,83,76,234,82,95,36,126,123,156,51,92,110,198,200,51,3,22,8,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
