Wrestling was low-budget working class entertainment back then, strictly UHF material. It was cheap theater. You had to bring your imagination to the proceedings and you got paid back double. I wrote these songs to re-immerse myself in the blood and fire of the visions that spoke to me as a child, and to see what more there might be in them now that I'm grown.\n\n-John Darnielle, Durham, NC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e55e988046e99567a8454df56645a607bad485dc","amp;dn":"The+Mountain+Goats+-+Beat+the+Champ+%5B2015%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e55e988046e99567a8454df56645a607bad485dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,94,152,128,70,233,149,103,168,69,77,245,102,69,166,7,186,212,133,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
