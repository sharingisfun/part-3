Only his magical link with animals - the old art known as the Wit - gives him solace and companionship. But the Wit, if used too often, is a perilous magic, and one abhorred by the nobility.\n\nSo when Fitz is finally adopted into the royal household, he must give up his old ways and embrace a new life of weaponry, scribing, courtly manners; and how to kill a man secretly, as he trains to become a royal assassin. - Goodreads Summary of Assassin's Apprentice (Farseer Trilogy #1)\n\nNote: This book was written over 30 years ago (author drafting and publishing), therefore some of the language and issue represented in this trilogy might be different to what modern day authors write.
