It was produced by Queen and Roy Thomas Baker and distributed by EMI in the United Kingdom, and Elektra in the United States.\n\nThe album launched the band to mainstream popularity both in the UK and internationally: the first single, &quot;Killer Queen&quot; reached No. 2 in the British charts and provided Queen with their first US Top 20 hit, peaking at No. 12 on the Billboard singles chart. Sheer Heart Attack was also the first Queen album to hit the US Top 20, peaking at No. 12 in 1975. Digressing from the progressive themes featured on their first two albums, Sheer Heart Attack featured more conventional rock tracks and marked a step towards the classic Queen sound. In recent years, it has been listed by multiple publications as one of the band's best works.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Brighton Rock&quot;   \tBrian May \t5:08\n02. \t&quot;Killer Queen&quot;   \tMercury \t3:01\n03. \t&quot;Tenement Funster&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t2:48\n04. \t&quot;Flick of the Wrist&quot;   \tMercury \t3:19\n05. \t&quot;Lily of the Valley&quot;   \tMercury \t1:43\n06. \t&quot;Now I'm Here&quot;   \tMay \t4:10\n07. \t&quot;In the Lap of the Gods&quot;   \tMercury \t3:20\n08. \t&quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;   \tMercury, May, Taylor, John Deacon \t2:12\n09. \t&quot;Dear Friends&quot;   \tMay \t1:07\n10. \t&quot;Misfire&quot;   \tDeacon \t1:50\n11. \t&quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot;   \tMercury \t2:13\n12. \t&quot;She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilettos)&quot;   \tMay \t4:08\n13. \t&quot;In the Lap of the GodsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Revisited&quot;   \tMercury \t3:42\n\n2011 Universal Records reissue bonus disc\n\n1. \t&quot;Now I'm Here (Live at Hammersmith Odeon)&quot;   \t4:25\n2. \t&quot;Flick of the Wrist (BBC Session, October 1974)&quot;   \t3:24\n3. \t&quot;Tenement Funster (BBC Session, October 1974)&quot;   \t2:58\n4. \t&quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown (A Cappella Mix 2011)&quot;   \t2:17\n5. \t&quot;In the Lap of the Gods ...
