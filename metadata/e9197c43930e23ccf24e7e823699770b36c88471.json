What was wrong with me? Why did I want to sin so badly\n\nAshton is getting tired of being good, of impressing her parents and playing ideal girlfriend to Sawyer Vincent. Sawyer is perfect, a regular Prince Charming, but when he leaves town for the summer, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his cousin Beau who catches AshtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye. Beau is the sexiest guy sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever seen, and even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dangerous, Ashton is drawn to him.\n\nBeau loves his cousin like a brother, so the last thing he wants to do is make a move on SawyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girl. Ashton is off-limits, absolutely. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why he does his best to keep his distance, even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in love with her forever. When Ashton wants to rekindle their childhood friendship in SawyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absence, Beau knows he should say no.\n\nAshton and Beau donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to hurt Sawyer. But the more they try to stay away from each other, the more intense their urges become. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting way too hard to resist...\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9197c43930e23ccf24e7e823699770b36c88471","amp;dn":"The+Vincent+Boys+Series+by+Abbi++Glines+%28Books+1+and+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9197c43930e23ccf24e7e823699770b36c88471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,25,124,67,147,14,35,204,242,78,126,130,54,153,119,11,54,200,132,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
