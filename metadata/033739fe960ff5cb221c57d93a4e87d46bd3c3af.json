It has\ndefault settings added and some hidden packages removed\n\n64-bit Source:\nen_windows_10_enterprise_2015_ltsb_n_x64_dvd_6848316.iso\n\nInstallation Indexes:\nWindows 10 Enterprise LTSB N\n\nRelease File: Win10-Enterprise2015-LTSB-N-Privacy-x64-en-US.iso\nSize: 2.56 GB\nSHA-1: 1283DC6C0F74055A81E32237C827FC7AB74C35BD\n\nLanguage: en-US (English - United States)\n\nTools used:\ndism for Windows Updates integration and mounted file copy\noscdimg for ISO mastering\ninstall_wim_tweak 1.4.7 for hidden package reveal/hide\n\nDISM (Indexes, boot.wim and winre.wim):\nKB3081424\n\nDISM (Index only):\nKB3074678, KB3074686 (Superseded but WU nags for them)\n\nFeatures:\n-UEFI/Fat32 support\n-NetFx3 pre-integrated\n-Windows Defender/Telemetry/and OneDrive Setup have been\ncompletely removed.\n-Some privacy options are in place to prevent all of your\nsearches to go straight to Microsoft servers.\n-Only index is pre-activated with AutoKMS from MTK 2.6b1\nso you don't need to worry about activation.\n-No Windows Store or Online Apps*\n*Settings app will still ping data to MS. Avoid it if you're\nparanoid\n\nInstructions:\n-Use a USB program such as RUFUS to put this on a 4GB+ USB\nFlash drive for boot installs, or burn to dvdr.\n-CUSTOMIZE YOUR SETUP OPTIONS DURING OOBE and DISABLE all of\nthe PRIVACY OPTIONS - I have no idea which options will\nremain in place if you don't do this.\n-I also have no idea if online mode will even work with this.\nI do not recommend it as Onedrive setup is already removed.\n\nFinal Notes:\n-This is not a 100% block of everything internet. You can still\nuse Windows Update, get new drivers, and everything else you\ncan normally do.\n\n-If you want to further block various things, you obviously can\ndo so. I personally recommend checking for updates with the\ndiag cab file (provided in torrent folder) to hide driver\nupdates that you may not want. (graphics, anyone?)\n\n-There is no way to choose which updates you want to install.\nYou either get all or none. If you really want to have a choice\nI suggest trying the program: Portable Update\n\n-If you're REALLY paranoid, I suggest going through Windows\nFirewall and disabling all of the advanced outbound rules for\nvarious apps and system functionality. Be careful, tho, or\nyou might break network functionality, internet, or activator.\n\nCredits:\nCODYQX4 - AutoKMS Activator\nmurphy78 - Integration, ISO design and testing\n\nEnjoy,\nmurphy78 :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033739fe960ff5cb221c57d93a4e87d46bd3c3af","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Enterprise+2015+LTSB+N+Privacy+en-US+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033739fe960ff5cb221c57d93a4e87d46bd3c3af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,55,57,254,150,15,245,203,34,28,87,217,58,78,135,212,107,211,195,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
