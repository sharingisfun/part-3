The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (11 November 1821 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 9 February 1881), sometimes transliterated Dostoevsky, was a Russian novelist, short story writer and essayist. Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the context of the troubled political, social and spiritual atmosphere of 19th-century Russia. He began writing in his 20s, and his first novel, Poor Folk, was published in 1846 when he was 25. His major works include Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880).\n\nMany literary critics rate him as one of the greatest and most prominent psychologists in world literature. His books have been translated into more than 170 languages and have sold around 15 million copies. Dostoyevsky influenced a multitude of writers, from Anton Chekhov and James Joyce to Ernest Hemingway and Jean-Paul Sartre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01b51e3d31c8e4ad4edb2b893176c135d978b32a","amp;dn":"Fyodor+Dostoyevsky+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01b51e3d31c8e4ad4edb2b893176c135d978b32a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,181,30,61,49,200,228,173,78,219,43,137,49,118,193,53,217,120,179,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
