It was finally released on February 14, 2016, by GOOD Music and Def Jam Recordings. The album features a wide array of guest vocalists; including Ty Dolla $ign, Desiigner, Kid Cudi, Caroline Shaw, Chance the Rapper, Frank Ocean, Rihanna, The Weeknd, Sia and Kendrick Lamar. The album's production was handled by a variety of contributors led by West; including Mike Dean, Rick Rubin, Metro Boomin, Hudson Mohawke, Charlie Heat and DJDS. Recording sessions for the album took place in various locations; including various cities in Italy, Mexico, Canada, and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Life of Pablo was supported by a series of promotional singles released in conjunction with West's GOOD Fridays giveaways, including &quot;Real Friends&quot; and &quot;No More Parties in LA,&quot; and was premiered at Madison Square Garden as part of West's Yeezy Season 3 fashion collaboration with Adidas. The album was initially launched exclusively through the streaming service Tidal after a series of delays in its recording and finalization, including multiple changes to its track sequencing and title in the previous weeks. Following the album's streaming release on Tidal, West continued to tinker with final mixes of the album, depicting it as &quot;a living breathing changing creative expression.&quot; An updated version of the album was made available on other streaming services and for purchase on April 1, 2016.\r\n\r\nUpon its release, The Life of Pablo received generally positive reviews from music critics, with particular attention drawn to its kaleidoscopic musical range and messy, unfinished composition. As Tidal refused to disclose streaming data to Nielsen Music. Nonetheless, its exclusive release on Tidal resulted in a large increase in subscribers to the servers and broke piracy records within the first three days of its release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e016f74be308a81ed02972c17d8a016ab1921fc1","amp;dn":"Kanye+West+-+The+Life+of+Pablo+%282-Disc+Super+Deluxe+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e016f74be308a81ed02972c17d8a016ab1921fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,22,247,75,227,8,168,30,208,41,114,193,125,138,1,106,177,146,31,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
