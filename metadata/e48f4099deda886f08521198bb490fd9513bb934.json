For instance it's about twice as fast as UNetbootin, Universal USB Installer or Windows 7 USB download tool, on the creation of a Windows 7 USB installation drive from an ISO (with honorable mention to WiNToBootic for managing to keep up). It is also marginally faster on the creation of Linux bootable USB from ISOs (1).\n\nDownload the executable and run it - no installation is necessary.\nIf elevation is required, you will be prompted for it.\n\nAll versions of Rufus since v1.1.0 allow the creation of a bootable USB from an ISO image (.iso). In a future version, we may add the ability to read files directly from a CD/DVD drive or from a folder...\n\nCreating an ISO image from a physical disc or from a set of files is very easy to do however, through the use of a CD burning application, such as the freely available CDBurnerXP.\nNotes on UEFI &amp; GPT support:\n\nSince version 1.3.2, Rufus support UEFI as well as GPT for installation media, meaning that it will allow you to install Windows 7, Windows 8 or Linux in full UEFI/GPT mode.\nHowever, Windows Vista or later is required for full UEFI/GPT support. Because of OS limitations, Windows XP restricts the creation of UEFI bootable drives to MBR mode.\n\nNotes on the Chinese version:\n\n    Unfortunately, I don't speak Chinese. The translation is someone else's work, which I wouldn't mind crediting, but they didn't contact me and (as far as I know) they didn't release the modified source (which they should have done to comply with the GPLv3 license).\n    This is very much WORK IN PROGRESS. No, I don't know when it will be completed. No, I'm not ready to accept translations for other languages or all the messages that haven't been translated to Chinese yet. If you want more info, please follow what happens with the source repository on github, and especially the localization branch. And yes, I will let everyone know when I am ready to accept more translations. Please just be patient!\n    UPDATE: The latest version should now properly display Chinese characters on Windows XP and prompt for the update policy in Chinese. If you picked a version before 2013.07.24, please download it again.\n\nThis is a generous person whom asks that you support other programers that need the financial assistance\n\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\nPlease Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack\n\nPLEASE SEED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
