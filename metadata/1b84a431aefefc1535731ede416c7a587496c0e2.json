Sebag-Montefiore also relates new details about the genesis of the code, little-known facts about how the Poles first cracked the LuftwaffeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version of the code (and then passed it along to the British), and the feverish activities at Bletchley Park, Based in part on documents recently unearthed from American and British archivesÃ¢â‚¬â€including previously confidential government filesÃ¢â‚¬â€and in part on unforgettable, firsthand accounts of surviving witnesses, Enigma unearths the stunning truth about the brilliant piece of decryption that changed history.
