Because of the Times was released by Hand Me Down Records, on 30 March 2007 in Ireland/Australia, April 2, 2007 in the UK and April 3, 2007 in the US. The album has received generally positive reviews and has appeared in numerous Top-10 lists for &quot;Album of the Year. \nThe album became the band's first number one album in the Republic of Ireland and United Kingdom. \n\nNME announced the band were working on a new album in March 2006. Lead singer Caleb Followill said, &quot;These songs are so much bigger, this band is so much better. There was a growth that people thought they heard on Aha Shake Heartbreak from Youth &amp; Young Manhood, but there's no comparison this time out. I think it's pretty evident when people hear it.&quot; The title refers to a large UPC ministers conference held in Alexandria, Louisiana that the brothers attended often.  Moreover, lead singer Caleb Followill has said the title comes from the saying that &quot;if an album does well it's 'because of the times' or if it bombs, it's 'because of the times'.&quot;\n\nThe album debuted at number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 42,000 copies in its first week. As of the 20th of December 2007, the album has sold over 362,000 copies in the UK.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Knocked Up\n[02] Charmer\n[03] On Call\n[04] McFearless\n[05] Black Thumbnail\n[06] My Party\n[07] True Love Way\n[08] Ragoo\n[09] Fans\n[10] The Runner\n[11] Trunk\n[12] Camaro\n[13] Arizona\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:51m:33s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 129mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t- 30 March 2007 [Ireland / Australia] 02 April 2007 [UK] 03 April 2007 [US]\n\nRecord Company\t\t- HandMeDownRecords RCA\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.kingsofleon.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n                            -\n                            - http://www.muzu.tv/kingsofleon  \n  \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:247420fc53dcb5e81e33e3b886d9067e068c1d60","amp;dn":"%5B2007%5D+Because+Of+The+Times+-+Kings+Of+Leon+-++129mb+%40+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"247420fc53dcb5e81e33e3b886d9067e068c1d60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,116,32,252,83,220,181,232,30,51,227,184,134,217,6,126,6,140,29,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
