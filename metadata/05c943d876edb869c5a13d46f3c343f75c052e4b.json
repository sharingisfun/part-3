The key to the highway was the modern-rock radio hit &quot;Pepper,&quot; a novelty rap tune that reinvents Lou Reed's &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; from the perspective of postpunk nihilism, Texas-style. Another rock-rap track, &quot;The Lord Is a Monkey,&quot; grafts a lyrical nod to Snoop Dogg over a mutilated Jimi Hendrix guitar lick. The rest of the album alternates pop-punk rave-ups (&quot;Ulcer Breakout,&quot; &quot;Ah Ha&quot;) with noisy acid freak-outs (&quot;My Brother's Wife,&quot; &quot;Space&quot;). The Buttholes have not released an album since Electric Larryland. But it's all right, Ma, they're only bleeding. --Rick Mitchell\n\n1. Birds - 3:10\n2. Cough Syrup - 4:32\n3. Pepper - 4:57\n4.
