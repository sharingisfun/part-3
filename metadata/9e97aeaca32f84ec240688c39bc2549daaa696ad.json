Chakra meditation is a form of concentration meditation (dharana). Concentration focuses our energy, mind and awareness onto a symbol. The symbol becomes charged with energy and meaning and is brought to life within us.\n\nBy learning to feel, visualize and balance the chakras, and all the powerful elemental forces contained within them, we awaken a potent inner power (shakti) and lift ourselves to a higher plane of consciousness.\n\nChakra meditations are used in the pursuit of higher consciousness and spiritual realization. These meditations increase our sense of connection to the universal. From this higher level of perception we feel more connected to a higher purpose that gives our life greater meaning and resonance. Physical and psychological health is a side-effect of these wonderful meditation techniques.\n\nTracks\n\n01 Talk on the Chakras\n02 Ujjayi\n03 Rotation through chakras\n04 Manipura shuddhi\n05 Ajna shuddhi\n\nPublisher Info\n\nTitle: The Chakras ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Purify Strengthen Awaken (Chakra Shuddhi)\nAuthor: Dr Swami Shankardev Saraswati and Jayne Stevenson\nPublisher: Big Shakti\nContent: Introductory Talk and Guided Meditation Techniques\nMedia: MP3/CD\nDuration: 75 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e97aeaca32f84ec240688c39bc2549daaa696ad","amp;dn":"Chakras+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Chakra+Shuddhi+%28Guided+Meditation+%29+%281+Audio+CD+-+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e97aeaca32f84ec240688c39bc2549daaa696ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,151,174,172,163,47,132,236,36,6,136,195,155,194,84,157,170,166,150,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
