A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/\n \n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:332ba9e070a5506394e1bb40c7ba5edbb516bb14","amp;dn":"Gentleman%5C%27s+Agreement+%281947%29.DVDRip.XviD.MultiSub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"332ba9e070a5506394e1bb40c7ba5edbb516bb14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,43,169,224,112,165,80,99,148,225,187,64,199,186,94,219,181,22,187,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
