He was awarded two U.S. National Book Awards, one in Children's Literature for his memoir A DAY OF PLEASURE (1970) and one in Fiction for his collection, A CROWN OF FEATHERS (1974).  In 1978, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his impassioned narrative art which, with roots in a Polish-Jewish cultural tradition, brings universal human conditions to life.&quot;\n\nSinger is best known as a writer of short stories, which have been published in more than a dozen collections.  His stories and novels reflect the world of the East European Jewry in which he grew up.  After his many years in America, his stories also portrayed the world of the immigrants and their pursuit of an elusive American dream, which seems always beyond reach.  In the end, Singer remains an unquestionably Jewish writer, yet his precise views about Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish God are open to interpretation.  Whatever they were, they lay at the center of his literary art.\n\nThis collection features a large selection of his novels, short stories, juvenile literature, and autobiographical writings.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n\n                                   == Novels ==\n\n* THE ESTATE (FSG, 1969)\n\n* THE FAMILY MOSKAT (Knopf, 1950).
