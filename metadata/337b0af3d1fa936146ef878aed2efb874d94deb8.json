From the deeply personal opening, &quot;Intro,&quot; to the ending, &quot;Outro (the Blood),&quot; Franklin takes us on a journey of faith littered with doubt, struggles, and a sincerity that's hard to resist. This mostly live release includes a handful of cameo appearances by the likes of Bishop T.D. Jakes, Yolanda Adams, and Jaci Velasquez. Such a diverse group of guests mirrors the accessibility of Franklin's music on this release. Ably backed by a tight band and the powerhouse Vocals of Life choir, Franklin takes no prisoners on the blistering &quot;Hosana,&quot; &quot;Caught Up,&quot; and the Rasta-flavored &quot;He Reigns,&quot; featuring Papa San. Franklin's songwriting prowess also surfaces in quieter numbers like &quot;Don't Cry&quot; and &quot;Always.&quot; Throughout his meteoric career, Franklin has skillfully combined soul, gospel, hip-hop, and pop into a multicolored tapestry. On Rebirth, Franklin's colors have never shown brighter. \n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:337b0af3d1fa936146ef878aed2efb874d94deb8","amp;dn":"Kirk+Franklin+-+2002+-+The+Rebirth+of+Kirk+Franklin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"337b0af3d1fa936146ef878aed2efb874d94deb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,123,10,243,209,250,147,97,70,239,135,138,237,46,251,135,77,148,222,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
