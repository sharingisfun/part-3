The audio quality is poor, but still listenable. The BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ raw energy, comes through loud and clear.\n\nThis album is devoted almost exclusively to covers; &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Ask Me Why&quot; are among the few Lennon-McCartney originals. Early rock &amp; roll songs are a major focus.\n\nAlthough the Beatles sound like diamonds in the rough on these performances, they had clearly developed a very distinctive sound.\n\nOne of the best-known semi-official Beatles releases.\n\n\n\nThe Beatles\n\nLast Night in Hamburg\n\n1999\n\n\n\n  CD / 1999 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
