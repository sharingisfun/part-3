It starts with two oscillators and two sub-oscillators that deliver all of the basic waveforms and a perfect emulation of JP-8000 Ã¢â‚¬Å“supersawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with pulse width, frequency and ring modulation plus a lush unison mode. The oscillators are fed into two powerful filters with serial or parallel routing, offering traditional low-, high- and band-pass modes as well as comb, resonator, waveshaper, and frequency shifter algorithms Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and more. To set all this in motion, Sunrizer has two ADSR envelopes and two LFO generators that can modulate virtually any parameter.\n\nMaster of effects\nSunrizer has a very flexible effects section which boasts an input crossover filter that lets you apply them only on a specific part of the spectrum. There is a total of four effect modules Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the first includes silky-smooth chorus, phaser and rotor algorithms alongside distortion, followed by stereo delay, two-band equalizer and a spacious and highly tuneable reverb. Yet with all this power Sunrizer still keeps the processor load low, thanks to heavy code optimizations.\n\nPowerfully live\nWhere the SunrizerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound engine ends, the fun only starts. First off, each patch has two sets of parameters and the synth lets you morph between them Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as smoothly or as wildly as you wish. Sunrizer also sports an arpeggiator that has fully programmable sequences and supports per-note transposition and randomization Ã¢â‚¬â€œ together with chord memory it allows you to create elaborate yet finely controllable single- or multi-finger passages.\n\nPolished simplicity\nDespite such an extensive feature list, Sunrizer has a single-screen design with finely crafted graphics that especially look gorgeous on Retina screens. All of its building blocks are logically arranged and easily accessible, with each individual parameter carefully calibrated. This lets Sunrizer give you a mix of utter pleasure and great productivity that is lacking in most unnecessarily overcomplicated synths.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGREETZ!\nALL PRESENT, PAST &amp; FUTURE TEAMS AND iNDs\nWHO MADE AUDiO WAREZ HiSTORY\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT GOOD DEVS WHO DON'T TORTURE USERS\nWiTH SHiTTY PROTECTiONS AND BUY WHAT YOU USE AND LiKE!\n\nNFO v.1.1 - 09.2014\n- C0ME T0 THE DARK SiDE -\n- HEXWARS -\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\ncastradio.net\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (05)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c0369b5f85ce0fba46778b7d911a7656f655c04","amp;dn":"BeepStreet+-+Sunrizer+v1.2.0+OS+X+%5BHEXWARS%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c0369b5f85ce0fba46778b7d911a7656f655c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,3,105,181,248,92,224,251,164,103,120,183,217,17,167,101,111,101,92,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
