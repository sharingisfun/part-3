Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo are here to say thatÃ¢â‚¬â€despite good intentionsÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an utter waste of time. Men are not complicated, although theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like women to think they are. And there are no mixed messages. The truth may be: HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just not that into you. \n\nStraightforward and sensible, HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Just Not That Into You educates otherwise smart women on how to tell when a guy just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like them enough, so they can stop wasting time making excuses for a dead-end relationship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1172f37c4256d77e7d34c1e5f7502487ab5621","amp;dn":"He%27s+Just+Not+That+Into+You+The+No-Excuses+Truth+to+Understandin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1172f37c4256d77e7d34c1e5f7502487ab5621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,17,114,243,124,66,86,215,126,125,52,193,229,247,80,36,135,171,86,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
