He was taught by Gustav Klimt, and at a very early age, like his Viennese Secession predecessors broke with the traditions of official Austrian art. His numerous self portraits and nude models remained consistent throughout his career in keeping with his erotic, sensual and tormented visions of art. The paintings and text included in this book bring the extraordinary talent of this artist who, sadly, died of Spanish influenza at the age of 28 in Vienna.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7f923f4851df6811c99764b986ed7534ab240fc","amp;dn":"Egon+Schiele+%28Paintings+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7f923f4851df6811c99764b986ed7534ab240fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,249,35,244,133,29,246,129,28,153,118,75,152,110,215,83,74,178,64,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
