It covers painting, mosaic,  drawing, printmaking, sculpture and architecture. Coins, textiles, pottery, enamels, and gold and silver are also included. The scope is world-wide, embracing the arts of Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Pacific Islands as well as Europe. The temples of India and south-east Asia, the landscape paintings of China, the religious and secular arts of Japan, Islamic architecture, the sculpture of pre-Columbian America, of Africa and Melanesia are all set in the same chronological framework. As a result,\nsome modern European ideas about art and its purpose and meaning are questioned, especially those about its 'progress' and its being intended primarily for aesthetic enjoyment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d2f924547480bcbbefa2a2ddc9c1de4d7ac6f7","amp;dn":"The+Visual+Arts+-+a+History+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d2f924547480bcbbefa2a2ddc9c1de4d7ac6f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,210,249,36,84,116,128,188,187,239,162,162,221,201,193,222,77,122,198,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
