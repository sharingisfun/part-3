Her co-star Paul Rudd was thirty-six in real life, although his character was twenty-nine and played the role of a teenager in the TV show inside the movie. But perhaps most unbelievable was Stacey Dash, who plays a teenager in the show within the movie, but was forty years old at the time of production.\n\nNorm MacDonald was originally cast as Rosie's ex-husband. According to MacDonald, he grew a bushy mustache for the role. When Amy Heckerling told him to shave it off, he quit the project. \n\nAlthough supposed to premiere in cinemas, this was released directly on DVD. \n\nAmy Heckerling's earlier movie Clueless starred Stacey Dash and Paul Rudd as teenagers; 12 years later in this movie, both Dash and Rudd play actors playing teenagers in the show within the movie. \n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nI Could Never Be Your Woman (2007) 720p BRrip_sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nvideo details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8bc3e2ece3cbc7bfa5bb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 7 frames\nMuxing mode                      : Header stripping\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 33mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 907 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.039\n\naudio details\nID                               : 3\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 1h 33mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\nlanguage                          english\n                      \n\nsubtitle                          english\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\nthanks to sun\n\nuploader \n sujaidr\n\n\n\nPLOT: Rosie (40), a divorced mother, produces the has-been TV comedy You Go Girl. Her boss no longer allows the show to tackle any vaguely controversial subjects, so it seems doomed. Then she meets at an audition Adam Perl (29), an attractive, spontaneously funny, single actor. She successfully casts him, which revives the show's ratings. She also dates him, but her pathological insecurity, focused on their age difference, compromises the relationship. That culminates when she suspects him of infidelity with the show's star, and the studio gives those two their own sitcom. \n\n\nDirector:Amy Heckerling\nStars:           Michelle Pfeiffer, Paul Rudd and Saoirse Ronan\nimdb: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466839/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466839/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nscreenshots\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/wVFBD.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/wVFBD.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/vjEBu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/vjEBu.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/Tgh4s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/Tgh4s.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/blv5j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/blv5j.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             \n\n                                        TO VISIT MY facebook page to post requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR \n\n\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE MOVIE THEN DO BUY THE ORIGINAL BLURAY/DVD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a507a5ea50ae874beb55437c4654990b9c7fc4f","amp;dn":"I+Could+Never+Be+Your+Woman+%282007%29+720p+BRrip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a507a5ea50ae874beb55437c4654990b9c7fc4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,80,122,94,165,10,232,116,190,181,84,55,196,101,73,144,185,199,252,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
