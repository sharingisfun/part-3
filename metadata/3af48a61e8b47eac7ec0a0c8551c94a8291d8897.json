He \r\nisn't. That doesn't stop him from embarrassing himself in front of \r\nthe cameras on a regular basis, whether from his political \r\nsermonizing, his stand-up 'comedy', or his incredibly unique \r\ndancing. Meanwhile, long-suffering Tim longs after Dawn the \r\nengaged receptionist and keeps himself sane by playing childish \r\npractical jokes on his insufferable, army-obsessed deskmate Gareth. \r\nWill the Slough office be closed? Will the BBC give David a game \r\nshow? Will Tim and Dawn end up with each other? And more \r\nimportantly, will Gareth realize what a hopeless prat he is? \r\n\r\nNOTE: Each episode of Series 1 starts with a short introduction\r\nby Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant.
