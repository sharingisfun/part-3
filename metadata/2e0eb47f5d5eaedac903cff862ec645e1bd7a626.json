A sunroom or screened porch are great locations to grow your own vegetables, herbs or flowers.\n\nJust come home with some fresh mozzarella, pick a ripe tomato from the plant in your sunroom, snip an aromatic basil leaf off your kitchen wall, and be enjoying a fresh made, 100% organic, totally pesticide free, Italian salad in less than a minute! Now imagine doing this in January. That's the joy of indoor gardening.\n\nIndoor gardening is good for you. Plants are more than just decorations. They clean the air by filtering out chemicals and producing oxygen. In crowded urban areas with poor air quality, growing an indoor garden has been shown to notably reduce indoor pollution. No matter what you grow, as long as you keep your plants healthy, they'll keep you healthy in return.\n\nIn this book you will learn about all kinds of indoor gardens and how you can get started growing your own plants right away!\n\nAs with all Simple Self-Sufficiency titles, this book is written in an interesting and readable manner, without all the &quot;fluff&quot;.
