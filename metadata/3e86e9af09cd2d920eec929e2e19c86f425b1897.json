Adams and Christopher Essex.\n\nÃ‚Â« For the most part, the solutions are detailed, especially in exercises on core material and techniques. Occasionally some details are omitted - for example, in exercises on applications of integration, the evaluation of the integrals encountered is not always given with the same degree of detail as the evaluation of integrals found in those exercises dealing specifically with techniques of integration. With a few exceptions, only the even-numbered exercises in the text are solved in this Manual.\n\nAs a student of Calculus, you should use this Manual with caution. It is always more beneficial to attempt exercises and problems on your own, before you look at solutions prepared by others. If you use these solutions as &quot;study material&quot; prior to attempting the exercises, you can lose much of the benefit that can follow from diligent attempts to develop your own analytical powers. When you have tried unsuccessfully to solve a problem, then look at these solutions to try to get a &quot;hint&quot; for a second attempt.
