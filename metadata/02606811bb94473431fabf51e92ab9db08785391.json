Nominated for Golden Palm - Cannes\nWhoever has seen any of Aki KaurismÃƒÂ¤ki&amp;#039;s films might agree that they are all but mainstream. Nevertheless, the story itself doesn&amp;#039;t have to be too complicated. In this case, a man completely loses his past in a shockingly violent way, and he rediscovers life again in an environment of bums who sleep in containers. The good thing I found about this movie was: No romanticism of misery, no enlightenment of the tortured hero, no sob-stuff love story, no superfluous, aloof intellectualism at all. At least not in an obtrusive or overly serious way. But in a way that it sometimes shocked me , sometimes made me laugh, sometimes grin. I was never bored. And as I made it to Finland for the first time in my life a few weeks after seeing this movie - I found everything to be amazingly authentic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02606811bb94473431fabf51e92ab9db08785391","amp;dn":"The+Man+Without+a+Past+%5Bby+Aki+Kaurism%C3%A4ki%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02606811bb94473431fabf51e92ab9db08785391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,96,104,17,187,148,71,52,49,250,191,81,233,42,185,219,8,120,83,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
