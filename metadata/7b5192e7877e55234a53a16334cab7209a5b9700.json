Photography is the art of eliciting emotion, and Perfectly Clear does it best.\n\nThis is only possible because Perfectly Clear applies 10 patented and patent pending processes in a very precise and rigorous way, replicating how the eye gathers light and overcoming the 15 ways your camera distorts your photos. Whether a camera is expensive or off the shelf, it still embodies limitations such as the single aperture which need to be overcome. Perfectly Clear makes its corrections while avoiding the pitfalls that all other editing and enhancement software introduce. And Perfectly Clear ensures quality through the auto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ correction applying a comprehensive suite of 12 corrections, yet it is smart enough to only apply the ones that a particular photo needs to be improved.\n\nQuality award winning photos demands the three things Perfect Photos need: accurate colors, perfect exposure emulating the human eye and preservation of color nuances and details.\n\nBut it's important to us that you make an informed decision.
