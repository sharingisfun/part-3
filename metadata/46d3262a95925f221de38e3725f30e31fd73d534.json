Now it's time for him to pay, and Wells has made it his personal mission. There are plenty of crosscurrents at work, though. The White House doesn't want anybody stirring the pot; his old CIA bosses have their own agendas; other countries are starting to sniff around, sensing something unusual. It is when Russia and China enter the mix, however, that the whole affair is set to combust. With alarming speed, Wells is once again on his own... and the wolves are closing in","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46d3262a95925f221de38e3725f30e31fd73d534","amp;dn":"THE+WOLVES+%28%2310%29+-+Alex+Berenson.+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46d3262a95925f221de38e3725f30e31fd73d534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,211,38,42,149,146,95,34,29,227,142,55,37,243,14,49,253,115,213,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
