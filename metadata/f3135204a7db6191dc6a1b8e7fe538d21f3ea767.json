Ft. &quot;Retro Garage House&quot;\r\n\r\nJose's work with the military has had him and his family relocating to different cities every few years. Now that he's getting ready to retire, Stacy and Jose want a tiny house that they can call home and watch their two young daughters grow up in. John and Zack's mission will be figuring out how to find balance between Stacy's love for retro while giving Jose a man cave to work on cars in, and of course a room for the most precious cargo of all, their little girls. John and Zack will have some serious marching orders to face on this build.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 23-Jul-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3135204a7db6191dc6a1b8e7fe538d21f3ea767","amp;dn":"Tiny.House.Nation.S04E16.300.Sq.Ft.Retro.Garage.House.WEB-DL.x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3135204a7db6191dc6a1b8e7fe538d21f3ea767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,19,82,4,167,219,97,145,220,106,27,142,127,229,56,210,31,62,167,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
