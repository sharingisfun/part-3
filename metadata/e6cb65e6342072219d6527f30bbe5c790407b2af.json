The Fall was recently awarded Game of the Year for Best Story from Giant Bomb.\n\nTake on the role of ARID, the artificial intelligence onboard a high-tech combat suit. ARID's program activates after crashing on an unknown planet. The human pilot within the combat suit is unconscious, and it is ARID's duty to protect him at all costs! As she progresses into her twisted and hostile surroundings, driven to find medical aid before it is too late, the realities of what transpired on this planet force ARID to reflect upon her own protocols. ARID's journey to save her pilot \nultimately challenges the very rules that are driving her.\n\nThe Fall is a unique combination of adventure-game puzzle solving, and side-scroller action, all set within a dark and atmospheric story. Exploration will be paramount to surviving your adventure. Utilize ARID's flashlight to uncover a myriad of interactive objects. If what you uncover is hostile, switch on your laser sight and kick some metal! Get ready for a disturbing journey as you fight, explore, and think your way forward, expanding ARID's world, in spite of her protocols.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½A compelling story - Crafted over the course of two years, The Fall's story is a cut above standard gaming fare.\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Story/Gameplay integration - Players encounter challenges that force them to think in ways congruent with the game's story.\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Thick atmosphere - A very well polished visual style is complemented with The Fall's full voice cast.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢Ã¢â€”â€¢\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/the_fall&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/the_fall&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6cb65e6342072219d6527f30bbe5c790407b2af","amp;dn":"The+Fall+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6cb65e6342072219d6527f30bbe5c790407b2af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,203,101,230,52,32,114,33,157,101,39,243,11,190,92,121,4,7,178,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
