Highly personal and idiosyncratic, sketchbooks offer an arena for unstructured exploration, a space free from all budgetary and client constraints. Visually arresting objects in their own right, this book aims to elevate sketches from mere ephemera to important documents where the reader can glean valuable insight into the creative process, and apply it to their own practices. Featured designers include Ralph Caplan, Nigel Holmes, Chris Bigg, Eva Jiricna, Jason Munn, Gary Baseman, Marian Bantjes, and many others.\n\nCONTENTS\n6 Introduction\n11 Rough\n67 Refined\n127 Random\n181 Revealed\nThe sketches behind the creation of this book\n188 Directory\n190 Notes + Acknowlegments\n192 About the Author","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a300879359131a8b9bc28bdf3b69c39b39f6a1b","amp;dn":"Sketchbook+-+Conceptual+Drawings+from+the+World%27s+Most+Influenti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a300879359131a8b9bc28bdf3b69c39b39f6a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,48,8,121,53,145,49,168,185,188,40,189,243,182,156,57,179,159,106,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
