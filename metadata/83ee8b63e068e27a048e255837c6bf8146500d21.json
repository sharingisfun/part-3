You can kill your enemy, cause unbearable pain, tear his muscles and sinews, break his bones or make him unconscious for some time and completely disable him to resist. Even a woman or a physically weak man who mastered this technique can curb a strong enemy. This technique demands deftness and skill, not brute force. It is necessary to train oneself daily to make the body flexible and nimble, but &quot;hardness&quot; must be hidden inside this 'softness.' &quot;\n\n\n\n@artpepper says: these are very serious and potentialy deadly techniques. They are NOT for fun or messing around with. Remember--it's usually a bad idea to maim or kill someone unless you actually mean to do it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83ee8b63e068e27a048e255837c6bf8146500d21","amp;dn":"Shaolin+Chin+Na+Fa%3A+The+Art+of+Seizing+and+Grappling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83ee8b63e068e27a048e255837c6bf8146500d21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,238,139,99,224,104,226,122,4,142,37,88,55,198,191,129,70,80,13,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
