One day, afraid he might miss the utility person, he opens the door to find a cute, mysterious girl, accompanying an elderly religious solicitor.\n\nThrough what seems to be a chain of coincidences, the girl, Misaki-chan, enters the life of Satou-kun, and promises him that she will cure him of his anti-social condition, provided that he follows the rules that she sets out for him.\n\nWhat follows is a story that takes Satou-kun from a desperate attempt at creating a galge computer game, to unwittingly joining a suicide cult, to participating in a pyramid scheme, to immersing himself in a MMORPG, along the way touching upon everything between hikikomori and otaku culture, existentialism, solipsism, theology, suicide, sacrifice and love.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: If you can't play any of these files you need to install the CCCP (http://www.cccp-project.net/) or any *.mkv capable player along with the Xvid codec. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a3b6e7b9ec92de56efe475cb4865a1bb95feef9","amp;dn":"%5BOyasumi%5D+NHK+ni+Youkoso+%21+%2F%2F+Welcome+to+the+NHK+%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a3b6e7b9ec92de56efe475cb4865a1bb95feef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,59,110,123,158,201,45,229,110,254,71,92,180,134,90,27,185,95,238,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
