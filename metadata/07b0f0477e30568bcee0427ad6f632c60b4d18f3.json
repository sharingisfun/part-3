(Coppola and screenwriter James V. Hart speak persuasively about their commitment to bringing StokerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision to the screen, rather than another revision.) Another documentary, &quot;In-Camera: The NaÃƒÂ¯ve Visual Effects of 'Dracula,'&quot; is a fascinating overview of CoppolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sometimes-frustrated effort to get the timeless special effects he was seeking. There are also quite a few deleted scenes among the special features, the best of which is an alternative cut to the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bloody ending.\n\nSYNOPSIS: This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's classic novel of the same name. A young lawyer is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of eastern Europe. He is captured and imprisoned by the undead vampire Dracula, who travels to London, inspired by a photograph of Harker's betrothed, Mina Murray. In Britain, Dracula begins a reign of seduction and terror.\n\n-------------------------------\nSPECIAL FEATURES: DOCUMENTARIES\n-------------------------------\n\nTITLE: In-Camera - The Naive Visual Effects of Dracula\n       Method &amp; Madness - Visualizing Dracula\n       The Blood is the Life - The Making of Dracula\n       The Costumes are the Sets - The Designs of Eiko Ishioka\n\nLANGUAGE: English\nSUBTITLES: N/A\n\nVIDEO CODEC: H.264\nAUDIO CODEC: AAC-LC\nCONTAINER: MP4\nRESOLUTION: 1280 x 720\n\n----------------------------\nSPECIAL FEATURES: COMMENTARY\n----------------------------\n\nTITLE: Francis Coppola - Director's Movie Commentary\n\nLANGUAGE: English\n\nAUDIO CODEC: AAC-LC\nRUN-TIME: 02:07:23\n\n--------------------------------\nSPECIAL FEATURES: DELETED SCENES\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: 12 Deleted Scenes + Outtakes\n\nLANGUAGE: English\nSUBTITLES: N/A\n\nVIDEO CODEC: H.264\nAUDIO CODEC: AAC-LC\nCONTAINER: MP4\nRESOLUTION: 704 x 384\n\n--------------------------\nSPECIAL FEATURES: TRAILERS\n--------------------------\n\nTITLE: Theatrical Trailer\n       Teaser Trailer\n\nLANGUAGE: English\nSUBTITLES: N/A\n\nVIDEO CODEC: H.264\nAUDIO CODEC: AAC-LC\nCONTAINER: MP4\nRESOLUTION: 1280 x 720","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07b0f0477e30568bcee0427ad6f632c60b4d18f3","amp;dn":"Dracula+%281992%29+%5BCollector%27s+Edition%5D+720p+Blu-ray+Movie+%2B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07b0f0477e30568bcee0427ad6f632c60b4d18f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,176,240,71,126,48,86,139,206,224,66,122,214,246,50,198,11,77,24,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
