It's not very hard \nto seed 300mb;) Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n(an excerpt from a recent david d newsletter):\n\n&quot;Sexual Communication&quot;\n\nAfter spending years trying to learn how to attract women, \nI began to notice that the guys who were the MOST successful \nwere actually communicating with women on a &quot;different level&quot;.\n\nAs I mentioned a little while ago, I took some big personal \nsteps forward when I went out and actually WATCHED guys who \nwere &quot;naturals&quot; as they interacted with women.\n\nI also mentioned that they often did things that didn't make \n&quot;logical sense&quot;. Sometimes they'd tease a beautiful woman about \nher looks... or accuse her of trying to use tricks to &quot;get laid&quot;... \nor turn the tables in some other way.\n\nAt first, it didn't make any sense at all to me.\n\nIn fact, it took quite awhile before I would even ACCEPT \nthat this stuff could POSSIBLY work to attract women.\n\nI mean, why would an attractive woman... who has her choice \nof guys... put up with being teased, busted on, and made fun of?\n\nWell, the more I watched, the more I learned... and the more \nit made &quot;sense&quot; to me.\n\nWhat I discovered was that there was a level of communication \nthat was happening... right in front of me all along... \nthat I just hadn't &quot;seen&quot; before.\n\nOne of the things that was MOST exciting was that once I started to \n&quot;get&quot; what was going on, I started to practice the &quot;language&quot; \nmyself and made pretty dramatic progress.\n\nLater, I named this level of communication... and I called it \n&quot;Sexual Communication&quot;.\n\nIt's a language... just like the English language... \nand once you learn it, you'll totally &quot;get&quot; how to use it in \nANY situation with women.\n\nYou'll also &quot;get&quot; why it is that women never responded to \nyou BEFORE on this level.\n\n\nThis type of communication is the KEY to flirting with \nwomen effectively, building attraction without risk... \nand taking things from one &quot;step&quot; to the next... \nsmoothly, and without any rejection.\n\nToward the end of this program, I'll also teach you \neasily take things to a &quot;physical&quot; level whenever you'd like.\n\nI think of this program mostly as an &quot;Inner Game&quot; program, \neven though it contains some fantastic step-by-step \ntechniques and progressions. I HIGHLY recommend it \nif you'd like to learn how to connect the Inner and Outer game\ntogether.\n\nDetails and video preview clips are here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.doubleyourdating.com/SexualCommunication/index.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.doubleyourdating.com/SexualCommunication/index.asp&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:442e02b4763e88720165d9b9db7858fa518c06dd","amp;dn":"David+DeAngelo+-+Sexual+Communication+%282nd+Ed.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"442e02b4763e88720165d9b9db7858fa518c06dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,46,2,180,118,62,136,114,1,101,217,185,219,120,88,250,81,140,6,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
