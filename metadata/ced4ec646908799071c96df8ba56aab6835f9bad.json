She certainly has her well-manicured hands full with more men than she can count in this exotic far-Eastern adventure. Among her fellow passengers on the Shanghai Express are her disillusioned former fiance, stalwart British medical corps officer Clive Brook; overfervent missionary Lawrence Grant; dope smuggler Gustav von Seyffertitz; and mysterious Eurasian businessman Warner Oland. As the train chugs through the more treacherous passages of war-torn China, Oland reveals himself as the leader of a rebel group, who plans to hold the passengers hostage to secure the release of his imprisoned followers. In Boule de Suif fashion, Dietrich, who is a notorious &quot;Chinese coaster&quot; but who has remained sexually aloof throughout the trip, gives herself to Oland to save the life of Brook, the man she truly loves. Directed by Josef von Sternberg at his most orgiastic (love those long, lingering dissolves!), Shanghai Express is 80% style and 20% substance, as proven by two less stylish remakes, Night Plane to Chungking and Peking Express.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023458/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023458/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-23458/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-23458/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nJosef von Sternberg\n\n\n\nMarlene Dietrich ...
