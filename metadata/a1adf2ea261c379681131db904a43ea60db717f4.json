Bernstein demystifies beer, and teaches you to choose from and enjoy the vast array of singular brews available today.\n\n\nIt's a great time to be a beer drinker, but also the most confusing, thanks to the dizzying array of available draft beers. Expert Joshua Bernstein comes to the rescue with The Complete Beer Course, demystifying the sudsy stuff and breaking down the elements that make beer's flavor spin into distinctively different and delicious directions. Structured around a series of easy-to-follow classes, his course hops from lagers and pilsners to hazy wheat beers, Belgian-style abbey and Trappist ales, aromatic pale ales and bitter IPAs, roasty stouts, barrel-aged brews, belly-warming barley wines, and mouth-puckering sour ales. There is even a class on international beer styles and another on pairing beer with food and starting your own beer cellar. Through suggested, targeted tastings, you'll learn when to drink down-and when to dump those suds down a drain.\n\nEPUB Retail: 320 pages\nPublisher: Sterling Epicure (September 3, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1402797672\nISBN-13: 978-1402797675","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1adf2ea261c379681131db904a43ea60db717f4","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Beer+Course+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1adf2ea261c379681131db904a43ea60db717f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,173,242,234,38,28,55,150,129,19,29,185,4,164,62,166,13,183,23,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
