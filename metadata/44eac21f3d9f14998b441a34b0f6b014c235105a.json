Often dubbed Earth's 'twin', it is the planet most similar to the Earth in size, mass and composition. There the similarity ends: Venus is shrouded by a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere, its surface is dominated by thousands of volcanoes and it lacks a protective magnetic field to shield it from energetic solar particles. So why isn't Venus more like Earth? In this book, a leading researcher of Venus addresses this question by explaining what we know through our investigations of the planet. Venus presents an intriguing case study for planetary astronomers and atmospheric scientists, especially in light of the current challenges of global warming, which supports, and potentially threatens, life on Earth. Scientifically rigorous, yet written in a friendly non-technical style, this is a broad introduction for students, and astronomy and space enthusiasts.\n\nCONTRNTS\nOverview page xi\nPrologue xiii\nA note on scientific units xvii\nAcknowledgements xix\nPart I Views of Venus, from the beginning to the present day\n1 The dawn of Venus exploration 3\n2 Mariner and Venera: the first space missions to Venus 17\n3 Pioneer Venus and Vega: orbiters, balloons and multiprobes 32\n4 Images of the surface 48\n5 The forgotten world 64\n6 Earth-based astronomy delivers a breakthrough 75\n7 CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop now: Galileo and Cassini fly past Venus 87\n8 Europe and Japan join in: Venus Express and Akatsuki 97\nPart II The motivation to continue the quest\n9 Origin and evolution: the solid planet 119\n10 Atmosphere and ocean 141\n11 A volcanic world 156\n12 The mysterious clouds 182\n13 Superwinds and polar vortices 197\n14 The climate on Venus, past, present and future 215\n15 Could there be life on Venus? 225\nPart III Plans and visions for the future\n16 Solar system exploration: what next for Venus? 237\n17 Coming soon to a planet near you: planned Venus missions 249\n18 Towards the horizon: advanced technology 259\n19 Beyond the horizon: human expeditions 270\nEpilogue 277\nReferences and acknowledgements 279\nAppendix A: Chronology of space missions to Venus 289\nAppendix B: Data about Venus 291\nIndex 293","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44eac21f3d9f14998b441a34b0f6b014c235105a","amp;dn":"The+Scientific+Exploration+of+Venus+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44eac21f3d9f14998b441a34b0f6b014c235105a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,234,194,31,61,159,20,153,139,68,26,52,176,246,176,20,194,53,16,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
