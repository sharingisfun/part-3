This film demonstrates that superbly. There are no women in this film, no distractions. It's about men up against it, and having to watch their comrades die needlessly against overwhelming odds.\nThe film has moments of silence, laughter, terror all mixed together with some superb skewed camera angles in the mess to give a feeling of drunken hopelessness.\nFlynn's relief at seeing Niven when he thought he was dead is a moving performance. His quiet moments when he talks about England, his control when trying to convince Nivens younger brother to go up for the first time - these scenes show real presence and talent. You feel for him and all around him.\nComing out just before the beginning of WW2 it would have given the home audiences great understanding of what they faced - a hard and bloody task, where young men will die as surely as the older ones will order them to fight.\nThis film should be reissued on DVD and shown around the world - it's that good. Let's write some more scripts like this and start making some decent films again.\n\nThanks to bob-1075 For The Review. \n\nDetails\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : The Dawn Patrol.avi \nFormat : AVI \nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave \nFile size : 698 MiB \nDuration : 1h 42mn \nOverall bit rate : 951 Kbps \nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release) \nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release \n\nVideo \nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom \nCodec ID : XVID \nCodec ID/Hint : XviD \nDuration : 1h 42mn \nBit rate : 852 Kbps \nWidth : 688 pixels \nHeight : 512 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 23.976 fps \nResolution : 8 bits \nColorimetry : 4:2:0 \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.101 \nStream size : 625 MiB (90%) \nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04) \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : MPEG Audio \nFormat version : Version 1 \nFormat profile : Layer 3 \nMode : Joint stereo \nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo \nCodec ID : 55 \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 1h 42mn \nBit rate mode : Variable \nBit rate : 86.3 Kbps \nNominal bit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nStream size : 63.4 MiB (9%) \nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame) \nInterleave, preload duration : 471 ms \nWriting library : LAME3.98r \nEncoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128 \nLanguage : English\n\nSubs = Bulgarian, English .\n \n\nIMDB Rating = \n\n7.6/10   983 vote   \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030044/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030044/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:849b7022dba53ff304469c743c88c1c94ff3b2ae","amp;dn":"The+Dawn+Patrol+-+%28Errol+Flynn+-+David+Niven%29%281938%29Dvd+Rip+%5BXVID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"849b7022dba53ff304469c743c88c1c94ff3b2ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,155,112,34,219,165,63,243,4,70,156,116,60,136,193,201,79,243,178,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
