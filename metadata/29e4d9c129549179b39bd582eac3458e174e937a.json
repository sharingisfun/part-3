The world takes the form of a giant floating castle called Aincrad, with 100 floors in it. Each floor has a medieval-themed setting and a dungeon with a boss, which has to be defeated before players can advance to the next higher floor. Like most RPGs, it implements a level-based system. However, after the beta testing, the game's creator activated a system to trap the players inside the game, unable to log out; if players die in-game, or the helmets they used are removed, a strong electromagnetic pulse is emitted to kill their real bodies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e4d9c129549179b39bd582eac3458e174e937a","amp;dn":"Sword+Art+Online+01+-+14+%5BEnglish+Dub%5D+%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e4d9c129549179b39bd582eac3458e174e937a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,228,217,193,41,84,145,121,179,155,213,130,234,195,69,142,23,78,147,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
