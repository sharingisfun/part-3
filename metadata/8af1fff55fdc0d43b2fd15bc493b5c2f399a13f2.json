As The KLF, Drummond and Cauty pioneered the genres &quot;stadium house&quot; (rave music with a pop-rock production and sampled crowd noise) and &quot;ambient house[citation needed]. The KLF released a series of international top-ten hits[citation needed] on their own KLF Communications record label, and became the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991[citation needed] The duo also published a book, The Manual, and worked on a road movie called The White Room.\n\nWhile Drummond and Cauty as the KLF &quot;had been around for many years with only moderate underground success, however, their fortunes turned upward when they decided to collaborate with several vocalists (P.P. Arnold, Maxine Harvey, Samantha Brown, etc.), rappers &amp; Wanda as a lead singer, lyricist &amp; sensuous centrepiece of their acclaimed songs &amp; video presentations, throughout the 90's. The result was a multimillion selling album.&quot;[5] Wanda Dee as lead vocalist on most of their top ten hits and videos was of key importance to this.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1987 What The Fuck's Going On\n1987 What The Fuck's Going On (LP)\n1988 3 AM Eternal (Single Pure Trance 2)\n1988 Down Town (Single)\n1988 The History Of The JAMs Aka The Timelords (TVT 4040CD)\n1988 Who Killed The JAMs\n1989 3 AM Eternal (Single The UK Mixes)\n1989 Kylie Said To Jason (Single KLF 010CD)\n1989 Shag Times (The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu)\n1989 The What Time Is Love Story (Single KLF &amp; VA)\n1990 Chill Out (WAX CD 7155)\n1990 So Hard (Single)\n1990 Space\n1990 What Time Is Love (Live At Trancentral Single WAX 9157)\n1990 What Time Is Love (Power Remix CDM Germany)\n1990 What Time Is Love (Single)\n1991 3 AM Eternal (Live At The SSL ASCD-2230)\n1991 3 AM Eternal (Single CDM Japan)\n1991 3 AM Eternal (Single The Moody Boys Selection INT 825 799)\n1991 America What Time Is Love (Single CDM Germany)\n1991 America What Time Is Love (Single 07822-12366-2)\n1991 Doctorin' The Tardis (TVT 4025-2)\n1991 It's Grim Up North (Single)\n1991 Justified &amp; Ancient (Single CDM Germany)\n1991 Justified And Ancient (Single Japan)\n1991 Last Train To Trancentral (Live From The Lost CDM Germany)\n1991 Last Train To Trancentral (Meets Moody Boys Uptown Single)\n1991 MU (Compilation Japan)\n1991 The White Room (Germany)\n1991 The White Room (Japan)\n1991 The White Room (UK)\n1991 What Time Is Love (Live At Trancentral CDM Promo US)\n1991 What Time Is Love (Single Japan)\n1991 What Time Is Love (Single Live At Trancentral ASCD-2365)\n1992 Justified &amp; Ancient (CDM US)\n1992 The JAMs 1987 (What The Is Going On!
