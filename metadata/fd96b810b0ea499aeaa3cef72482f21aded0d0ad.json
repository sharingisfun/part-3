Now Kain, who once controlled the land of Nosgoth with his vampire armies, finds his brethren slain and his dark powers stripped by a mysterious figure. To reclaim his rule and exact his vengeance, Kain must dispatch armies of zealot soldiers and overcome legions of demons in order to uncover the ominous plot that threatens the land he seeks to conquer.\n\nBlood Omen 2, the second instalment in the Legacy of Kain Series, is a 3rd person 3D action/combat game in which you assume the role of the vampire Kain. A compelling story takes you through huge, lushly detailed 3D environments and challenges your skills in combat, puzzle solving, stealth and exploration. With each success, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll gain new dark gifts that will grant Kain the ability to access treacherous new areas to explore and the power to face stronger, more aggressive enemies. As you develop a stronger, more skilled vampire, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be rewarded with dozens of dazzling in-game cinematic sequences that unfold the continuing epic of Nosgoth, and KainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempts to ultimately rule over it.\n\nMinimum system requirements: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), 2GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard.\n\nACCEPTANCE OF END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT REQUIRED TO PLAY\n\nInstall and Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd96b810b0ea499aeaa3cef72482f21aded0d0ad","amp;dn":"Legacy+of+Kain%3A+Blood+Omen+2+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd96b810b0ea499aeaa3cef72482f21aded0d0ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,150,184,16,176,234,73,154,234,163,206,247,36,130,242,26,222,208,208,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
