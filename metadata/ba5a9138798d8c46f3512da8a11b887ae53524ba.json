It opens as Scottie Ferguson (James\nStewart) realizes he has vertigo, a condition resulting in a fear of\nheights, when a police officer is killed trying to rescue him from falling\noff a building. Scottie then retires from his position as a private\ninvestigator, only to be lured into another case by his old college friend\nGavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Elster's wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), has been\npossessed by a spirit, and Elster wants Scottie to follow her. He\nhesitantly agrees, and thus begins the film's wordless montage as Scottie\nfollows the beautiful yet enigmatic Madeleine through 1950s San Francisco\n(accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's hypnotic score). After saving her from\nsuicide, Scottie begins to fall in love with her, and she appears to feel\nthe same way. Here tragedy strikes, and each twist in the movie's second\nhalf changes our preconceptions about the characters and events. In 1996\na new print of Vertigo was released, restoring the original grandeur of\nthe colors and the San Francisco backdrop, as well as digitally enhancing\nthe soundtrack.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-James Stewart.\n=&gt;-Kim Novak.\n=&gt;-Barbara Bel Geddes.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Mystery : Romance : Thriller : Classic.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1958.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 2.03 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 258 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 8mn.\n=&gt;-Vertigo....................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vertigo/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1920 x 1040.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2011 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 251 Kbps.\n\nEnglish Commentary.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 136 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba5a9138798d8c46f3512da8a11b887ae53524ba","amp;dn":"Vertigo+-+Alfred+Hitchcock+Thriller+1958+Eng+Subs+1080p+%5BH264-mp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba5a9138798d8c46f3512da8a11b887ae53524ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,90,145,56,121,141,140,70,243,81,45,168,161,27,136,122,229,53,36,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
