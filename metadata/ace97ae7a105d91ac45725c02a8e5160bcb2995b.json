Get a taste of the rivalry of the time as you earn your way to become the townâ€™s richest oil baron.\r\n\r\nSearch for oil using a dowser, mole or scanner. Once found, you can build a rig, create a pipe network to bring up the oil, and store it in silos waiting for the right time to sell. Every level is time-based, so buy upgrades to sell more oil faster than your rivals. As the mining seasons float by, the town goes through different stages of growth. New upgrades become available, as well as new territories with oil rich grounds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ace97ae7a105d91ac45725c02a8e5160bcb2995b","amp;dn":"Turmoil+v0.0.0.256","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ace97ae7a105d91ac45725c02a8e5160bcb2995b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,233,122,231,161,5,217,26,196,87,37,192,42,142,81,96,188,178,153,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
