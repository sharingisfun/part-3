Brilliant and legendary writer Dennis O'Neil and his equally remarkable artist partner Neal Adams used these two characters as a platform to attack social inequity (racism, poverty) and social ills (drugs, etc.) and created on of the most progressive voices in the industry. The troubles of Roy Harper and his heroin addiction are particularly famous. Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) and Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) made a unique mismatched duo, with Hal always looking toward the cosmic and being the consummate lawman while Ollie was the more laid back and liberal of the pair. This ediiton collects Green Lantern v1 #76-87 and 89, and stories from The Flash #217-219 and 226. This awesome one-volume collection is presented in Digital-HD thanks to Tyrant Lizard King-Empire. Hope you like these classics, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d7e1fb0889546db7267e5872e8745e1f0483e9","amp;dn":"Green+Lantern%2FGreen+Arrow+TPB+%281970-1973%7C2013%29+%28Dgtl%7CTLK-E-HD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d7e1fb0889546db7267e5872e8745e1f0483e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,215,225,251,8,137,84,109,183,38,126,88,114,232,116,94,31,4,131,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
