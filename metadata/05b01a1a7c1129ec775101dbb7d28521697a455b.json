Metal&quot; group from Eureka California, hens the name of their final album. Mr. Bungle released 4 demo tapes and 3 complete studio albums. The band was initially started by Mike Patton, Trey Spruance, Trevor Dunn, Jed watts, and Theo Lengyel. They were high-school buddies who released their first demo tape &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny&quot; in 1986.\n\nThis torrent includes every single recorded song by Mr. Bungle (with the exception of some covers and live recordings) The .zip file conceals the following:\n\nDemo Tapes:\n\n     The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny..(1986)\n     Bowl of Chile.........................(1987)\n     Goddammit I Love America!.............(1988)\n     OU818.................................(1989)\n\nStudio Albums:\n\n     Mr. Bungle [Self-Titled Album Debut]..(1991)\n     Disco VolantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«.........................(1995)\n     California............................(1999)\n\nOther:\n\n     Covers................................(1979-2004)\n\n\nThe covers album includes a bunch of Mr. Bungle's most popular covers including &quot;The Super Mario Brothers Theme.&quot; I threw that together myself from the &quot;Caca VolantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«&quot; (an old Mr. Bungle fansite) when it still existed. the covers album does not include &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot; BECAUSE IT IS NOT ACTUALLY BY MR. BUNGLE. It's actually done by &quot;The Ping-Pang Band&quot; and they certainly deserve credit for such wonderful works.\n\nJust extract the .zip file to get your music. All files are in high-quality .mp3's and tagged correctly. (I made sure of that) The .zip file password is as follows:\n\n\nPASSWORD: &quot;pattonisgod&quot;\n\n\n...without the quotes. Mr. Bungle ROCKS!!!!!\n\n---\n\n!!!!!!SEED THE TORRENT OR MR. NICE GUY WILL COME AND RAPE YOU IN YOUR SLEEP!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05b01a1a7c1129ec775101dbb7d28521697a455b","amp;dn":"Mr.+Bungle+-+Complete+7+Album+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05b01a1a7c1129ec775101dbb7d28521697a455b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,176,26,26,124,17,41,236,119,81,1,219,183,210,133,33,105,122,69,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
