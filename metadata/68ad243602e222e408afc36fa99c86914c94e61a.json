We'll cover the different selection and transform tools it offers and use tools like Soft Selection and Vertex Locking. We'll also cover working with symmetry and using Shrinkwrap to wrap geometry around other objects.\n\nWe'll also cover each of the mesh edit tools, from Bevel to Extrude, to Connect and Bridge. In addition, we'll spend time learning about the Multi-Cut tool and how it can replace multiple existing tools in our workflow.\n\nFinally, we'll cover custom polygon creation and retopology using Quad Draw. In the end, you'll know how the Modeling Toolkit works and be able to make an informed decision about how you can begin to integrate those tools into your existing Maya modeling workflow.
