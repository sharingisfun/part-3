Eliades Ochoa is considered one of the most important Cuban Ã¢â‚¬ËœsonerosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of all time and guardian of traditional Cuban music. His trademark cowboy hat belies the fact that he is a Ã¢â‚¬ËœGuajiroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (from the countryside), and his musical interests run along this traditional line. His repertoire includes 'son', Ã¢â‚¬ËœguararchaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœboleroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœchangÃƒÂ¼iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAfro-CubanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ music. Eliades has added D and G-strings to his tres (Cuban guitar), to get his distinctive paired-string chime.\n\nIn 1986 Pancho Cobas introduced Eliades to the veteran singer Compay Segundo, who at that point had pretty much stopped playing and performing, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Compay gave me this cassette of his songs, old and new, and said that if we liked any of them maybe Patria could perform them. That was the first time I heard Ã¢â‚¬ËœChan ChanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. What a song! I could see that although he was really rusty, he was still very strong and at the time still had this great voice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCompay joined Cuarteto Patria seeing a revival in his career; they recorded the album Ã¢â‚¬ËœChanchaneandoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in 1989 which featured the original version of Ã¢â‚¬ËœChan ChanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nEliades would be reunited with Compay, when in 1996 World Circuit made their now legendary trip to HavanaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Egrem Studios; the resulting Ã¢â‚¬ËœBuena Vista Social ClubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ proved to be an unexpected phenomena changing the lives of everybody involved.\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd4935c338b661235d56ed6b06db06666e0239e7","amp;dn":"Compay+Segundo+%26amp%3B+Eliades+Ochoa+-+Chanchaneando+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd4935c338b661235d56ed6b06db06666e0239e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,73,53,195,56,182,97,35,93,86,237,107,6,219,6,102,110,2,57,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
