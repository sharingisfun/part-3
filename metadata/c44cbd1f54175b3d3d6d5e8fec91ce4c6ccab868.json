Mercenary, yes, but a girl's got to eat. Her most recent case, however, is enough to ruin her appetite. Hired to find a teenager who has been taken to the Otherworld, Eugenie comes face to face with a startling prophecy--one that uncovers dark secrets about her past and claims that Eugenie's first-born will threaten the future of the world as she knows it.\n\nNow Eugenie is a hot target for every ambitious demon and Otherworldy ne'er-do-well, and the ones who don't want to knock her up want her dead. Eugenie handles a Glock as smoothly as she wields a wand, but she needs some formidable allies for a job like this. She finds them in Dorian, a seductive fairy king with a taste for bondage, and Kiyo, a gorgeous shape-shifter who redefines animal attraction. But with enemies growing bolder and time running out, Eugenie realizes that the greatest danger is yet to come, and it lies in the dark powers that are stirring to life within her...\n\n#2 - Thorn Queen\n\nEugenie Markham is a shaman for hire, paid to bind and banish creatures from the Otherworld. But after her last battle, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also become queen of the Thorn Land. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly an envious life, not with her kingdom in tatters, her love life in chaos, and Eugenie eager to avoid the prophecy about her firstborn destroying mankind. And now young girls are disappearing from the Otherworld, and no oneÃ¢â‚¬â€except EugenieÃ¢â‚¬â€seems willing to find out why.\n\nEugenie has spilled plenty of fey blood in her time, but this enemy is shrewd, subtle, and nursing a very personal grudge. And the men in her life aren't making things any easier. Her boyfriend, Kiyo, is preoccupied with his pregnant ex, and sexy fey king Dorian always poses a dangerous distraction. With or without their help, Eugenie must venture deep into the Otherworld and trust in an unpredictable power she can barely control. Reluctant queen or not, Eugenie has sworn to do her dutyÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means facing the darkestÃ¢â‚¬â€and deadliestÃ¢â‚¬â€side of her natureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n#3 - Iron Crowned\n\nShaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm. But as the Thorn LandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s queen, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fast running out of ways to end the brutal war devastating her kingdom. Her only hope: the Iron Crown, a legendary object even the most powerful gentry fearÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWho Eugenie can trust is the hardest part. Fairy king Dorian has his own agenda for aiding her search. And Kiyo, her shape-shifter ex-boyfriend, has every reason to betray her along the way. To control the CrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever-consuming powers, Eugenie will have to confront an unimaginable temptation--one that will put her soul and the fate of two worlds in mortal perilÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n#4 - Shadow Heir\n\nShaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham strives to keep the mortal realm safe from trespassing entities. But as the Thorn Land's prophecy-haunted queen, there's no refuge for her and her soon-to-be-born-children when a mysterious blight begins to devastate the Otherworld...\n\nThe spell-driven source of the blight isn't the only challenge to Eugenie's instincts. Fairy king Dorian is sacrificing everything to help, but Eugenie can't trust the synergy drawing them back together. The uneasy truce between her and her shape shifter ex-lover Kiyo is endangered by secrets he can't--or won't--reveal. And as a formidable force rises to also threaten the human world, Eugenie must use her own cursed fate as a weapon--and risk the ultimate sacrifice...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c44cbd1f54175b3d3d6d5e8fec91ce4c6ccab868","amp;dn":"Dark+Swan+Series+-+Richelle+Mead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c44cbd1f54175b3d3d6d5e8fec91ce4c6ccab868","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,76,189,31,84,23,91,61,61,109,94,143,236,145,206,76,108,202,184,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
