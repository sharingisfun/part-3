This particular tweak has been requested by many users out there, so it also serves as living proof that Microsoft is indeed listening to their feedback.\n\nAt the same time, the PC settings screen is improved in Windows 10 build 9888 and now comes with a search box that allows users to quickly look for specific options.\n\nLast but not least, it also brings unified context menus on the desktop, but this particular feature is not yet completed, so you might also see the old menus across the operating system as well.\n\nObviously, some other subtle changes could also be available, but we'll find more when Microsoft officially introduces this particular build for users.\n\nFile: JM1_CCSA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV5.iso\nCRC-32: e5ca6985\nMD4: b6fcf03e2fdc27c5bd6401a9ff6152e8\nMD5: 3f22b7ea2a4fec287d2941f54bb24d32\nSHA-1: 4f1609e39f1a067ae00d39c3eed7b099ede83c07","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81bce3f314078a21a9e12029e8b224a4da9a339b","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Technical+Preview+Build+9888+%5BLeak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81bce3f314078a21a9e12029e8b224a4da9a339b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,188,227,243,20,7,138,33,169,225,32,41,232,178,36,164,218,154,51,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
