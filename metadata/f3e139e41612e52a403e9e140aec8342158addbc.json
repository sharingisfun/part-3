I got fed up with seeding like hundreds of GB's when really not necessary. So I experimented a bit, and made some roughly 18 hour long &quot;re-codings&quot; of these original files, and boiled it down to like 1,4 and 1,4 GB files instead. According to me, there's really no telling any difference between the original files and these, except for file size of course.\nI am by no means any sort of &quot;pro moviemaker&quot;, so I excuse for any stupid choice of codecs (and &quot;media info&quot;) etc. But these have been working fine as far as I've tried them out.\n\nI embedded the English subtitles - not hardcoded - but you should be able to pop them up in many - or most - players that support subtitles. I can even use them in &quot;MX Player&quot; on my Android phone. If you can't get them showing, I am pretty sure you can find them elsewhere. These are the restored versions issued by the Murnau Stiftung in 2012.\n\nShare and seed until RagnarÃƒÂ¶k!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3e139e41612e52a403e9e140aec8342158addbc","amp;dn":"Die.Nibelungen.Teil.1%26amp%3B2-Fritz.Lang-1924.Blu-Ray-Rip.h264-MPE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3e139e41612e52a403e9e140aec8342158addbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,225,57,228,22,18,229,42,64,62,158,20,10,236,131,66,21,138,221,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
