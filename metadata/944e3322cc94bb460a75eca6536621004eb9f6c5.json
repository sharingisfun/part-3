This heralded a string of successes, including A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Orpheus Descending, and Sweet Bird of Youth. His later work attempted a new style that did not appeal to audiences, and alcohol and drug dependence further inhibited his creative output.\r\n\r\nWilliams adapted much of his best work for the cinema, and also wrote short stories, poetry, essays and a volume of memoirs. In 1979, four years before his death, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\n===================================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nThe torrent contains all the books in epub format:\r\n\r\n- 27 Wagons Full of Cotton and Other Plays\r\n\r\n- A House Not Meant to Stand\r\n\r\n- A Streetcar Named Desire\r\n\r\n- Baby Doll &amp; Tiger Tail\r\n\r\n- Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\r\n\r\n- Clothes for a Summer Hotel\r\n\r\n- Collected Stories\r\n\r\n- Crazy Night\r\n\r\n- Fugitive Kind\r\n\r\n- A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur\r\n\r\n- The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays\r\n\r\n- Memoirs\r\n\r\n- Mister Paradise and Other One-Act Plays \r\n\r\n- Not About Nightingales\r\n\r\n- The Notebook of Trigorin\r\n\r\n- Orpheus Descending and Suddenly Last Summer\r\n\r\n- The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\r\n\r\n- Something Cloudy, Something Clear\r\n\r\n- Spring Storm\r\n\r\n- Stairs to the Roof\r\n\r\n- Suddenly Last Summer and Other Plays\r\n\r\n- Sweet Bird of Youth\r\n\r\n- Tales of Desire\r\n\r\n- The Glass Menagerie\r\n\r\n- The Night of the Iguana\r\n\r\n- The Traveling Companion &amp; Other Plays\r\n\r\n- The Two-Character Play\r\n\r\n- Vieux Carre\r\n\r\n===================================================================================\r\n\r\nRead the following article, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\r\n \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams\r\n  \nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3209/the-art-of-theater-no-5-tennessee-williams\r\n  \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/31/specials/williams-interview75.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:944e3322cc94bb460a75eca6536621004eb9f6c5","amp;dn":"Tennessee+Williams+-+Plays+and+Prose+%2828+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"944e3322cc94bb460a75eca6536621004eb9f6c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,78,51,34,204,148,187,70,10,117,236,166,83,102,33,0,78,185,246,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
