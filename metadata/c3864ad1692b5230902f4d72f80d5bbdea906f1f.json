While the sound back then was SoCal skatepunk influenced by thrash elements and copious amounts of weed, Doughty and McDonald's playing and singing had matured considerably by 2001 and Live &amp; Direct: Acoustic Roots. The duo was later rounded by drummer Ryan Moran and percussionist/vocalist Oguer Ocon. By 2003 and Everything You Need, they were rocking a California-centric sound of loopy sampledelic pop, hip-hop influence, sunny marijuana affirmations, and the occasional return to raucous skatepunk. In 2005, Slightly Stoopid released their most accomplished album to date, Closer to the Sun. The record mixed dub and reggae influences with light hip-hop and an easy groove.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nChronchitis (2007)\n\nCloser To The Sun (2005)\n\nEverything You Need (2003)\n\nLive &amp; Direct Acoustic Roots (2001)\n\nSlightly Stoopid (1998)\n\nSlightly Not Stoned Enough To Eat Breakfast Yet Stoopid (2008)\n\nThe Longest Barrel Ride (1998)\n\nWinter Tour '05-'06 (2006)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
