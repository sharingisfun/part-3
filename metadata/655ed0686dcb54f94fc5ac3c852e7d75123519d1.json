The opening pages flip among the\n   various realities of Doug, a young man recovering from a head injury of some\n   kind with only a box of pills and some strawberry Pop-Tarts to speed his\n   recovery. Flashbacks and dreams switch among various scenes: Doug and his\n   hypocrite father; a wild party gone awry when Doug's crush object's crazy (but\n   unseen) boyfriend goes on a rampage; and, most mysteriously, another world Ã¢â‚¬â€\n   found behind a hole in a brick wall Ã¢â‚¬â€ where dead cats live, worms weep, and a\n   giant hive rules a grim city of deformed creatures. Burns's control of the\n   story is masterfulÃ¢â‚¬â€the recurring imagery make it unclear just which is the\n   reality and which is the dream. His sharply delineated art captures a\n   grotesque yet sympathetic view of kids thrust far beyond a world that they can\n   control or even understand. The only disappointment about X'ed Out is its\n   brevity Ã¢â‚¬â€ the first of several installments, it will leave you begging for the\n   rest of the story. &quot; \n\n\n\nContains:\n\n   X'ed Out (2010) (c2c) (Minutemen-DTs)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:655ed0686dcb54f94fc5ac3c852e7d75123519d1","amp;dn":"Charles+Burns%3A+X%27ed+Out+%28Random+House%7C2010%7CGN-c2c%7CMinutemen-DTs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"655ed0686dcb54f94fc5ac3c852e7d75123519d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,94,208,104,109,203,84,249,79,197,172,60,133,46,125,117,18,53,25,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
