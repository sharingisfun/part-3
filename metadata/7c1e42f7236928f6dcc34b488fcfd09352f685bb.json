Ã¢â‚¬Å“Living in Georgia much of my life, they were the local legends that everybody loved. They had the swing, the inventive double guitar parts, the ability to jam just long enough to keep the audience, and that golden voice of GregÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s! When my instrumental rock band, the Dixie Dregs, played, we often played Ã¢â‚¬ËœJessica,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which automatically makes any audience start moving and smiling. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been lucky enough to sit in with many of the members at various times, and we have shared a lot of common ground. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still a fan!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1e42f7236928f6dcc34b488fcfd09352f685bb","amp;dn":"VA+-+Midnight+Rider+Tribute+to+the+Allman+Brothers+Band+%282014%29+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1e42f7236928f6dcc34b488fcfd09352f685bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,30,66,247,35,105,40,246,220,195,75,72,143,207,208,147,82,246,133,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
