The tutorial section contains a 1 hour 40 min. in-depth presentation by Ayshe, explaining the roles of the core muscles in the anatomy of dance movement, and their impact on our health and postural habits. \n\nIn this program we focus on the abdominal core muscles that span the lower spine, pelvis, and legs. Of main importance are the psoas andÃƒâ€š iliacus (iliopsoas), the key muscles for structural balance in the human body. The balanced fully-functional psoas is crucial for women's health.Ãƒâ€š  If the psoas isÃƒâ€š in a state of contraction or atrophy it will affect the reproductive system by restricting blood supply and disrupting the positioning of the organs within the pelvis.Ãƒâ€š  Menstrual cramping is often caused by the psoas exerting pressure on the reproductive organs when they are in a state of tenderness.Ãƒâ€š  A healthy, released psoas will bring relief from cramping and lower back pain. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc078c90e85a350670b0fb5b550cc9ae67bfd1f","amp;dn":"Bellydance+for+Core+Fitness+-+A+Belly+Dance+Workout+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc078c90e85a350670b0fb5b550cc9ae67bfd1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,192,120,201,14,133,163,80,103,11,15,181,181,80,204,154,230,123,253,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
