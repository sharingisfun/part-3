Luna\n2004\nENGLISH\nISBN: 0312319061\nPDF \n308 pages \n5.29 MB\n\n From cyberspace to crawl spaces, new innovations in information gathering have left the private life of the average person open to scrutiny, and worse, exploitation. In this thoroughly revised update of his immensely popular guide How to Be Invisible, J.J. Luna shows you how to protect yourself from these information predators by securing your vehicle and real estate ownership, your bank accounts, your business dealings, your computer files, your home address, and more.\n J.J. Luna, a highly trained and experienced security consultant, shows you how to achieve the privacy you crave and deserve, whether you just want to shield yourself from casual scrutiny or take your life savings with you and disappearing without a trace. Whatever your needs, Luna reveals the shocking secrets that private detectives and other seekers of personal information use to uncover information and then shows how to make a serious commitment to safeguarding yourself.\n There is a prevailing sense in our society that true privacy is a thing of the past. Filled with vivid real life stories drawn from the headlines and from Luna's own consulting experience, How to Be Invisible, Revised Edition is a critical antidote to the privacy concerns that continue only to grow in magnitude as new and more efficient ways of undermining our personal security are made available. Privacy is a commonly-lamented casualty of the Information Age and of the world's changing climate-but that doesn't mean you have to stand for it.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7af2b8232d300de5d827aa8ade90e8d8179ff8eb","amp;dn":"How+to+Be+Invisible%3A+The+Essential+Guide+to+Protecting+Your+Pers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7af2b8232d300de5d827aa8ade90e8d8179ff8eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,242,184,35,45,48,13,229,216,39,170,138,222,144,232,216,23,159,248,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
