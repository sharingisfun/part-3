Now, Angel offers a new full length album, Burn Your Fire for No Witness out February 18th, 2014 where she further explores a sound familiar, but only widens her vocal range to new expressive heights. She captures both bravery and vulnerability in her war cries bringing the listener closer if they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already sucked into AngelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crackling fire gaze. Her new album, produced by John Congleton, stokes the fire and aggravates the flames inside of Angel releasing an energy and voice not heard before. ..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66663e554762760c476abb3d392a03b084b9272f","amp;dn":"Angel+Olsen+-+Burn+Your+Fire+For+No+Witness+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66663e554762760c476abb3d392a03b084b9272f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,102,62,85,71,98,118,12,71,106,187,61,57,42,3,176,132,185,39,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
