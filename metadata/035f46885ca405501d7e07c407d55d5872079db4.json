Or the perfect lie?\r\n\r\nThe debut psychological thriller you can't miss!\r\n\r\nEveryone knows a couple like Jack and Grace. He has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You might not want to like them, but you do.\r\n\r\nYou'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart.\r\n\r\nSome might call this true love. Others might ask why Grace never answers the phone. Or how she can never meet for coffee, even though she doesn't work. How she can cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim. And why there are bars on one of the bedroom windows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:035f46885ca405501d7e07c407d55d5872079db4","amp;dn":"Behind+Closed+Doors+%5BAudiobook%5D+by+B.+A.+Paris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"035f46885ca405501d7e07c407d55d5872079db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,95,70,136,92,164,5,80,29,126,7,196,7,213,93,88,114,7,157,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
