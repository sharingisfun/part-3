In 1998 he was discovered in a talent contest where he displayed his piano and song-writing skills. Over the next two years, he was hired to compose for popular Chinese singers. Although he was trained in classical music, Chou combines Chinese and Western music styles to produce songs that fuse R&amp;B, rock and pop genres, covering issues such as domestic violence, war, and urbanization.\n\n    In 2000 Chou released his first album, titled Jay, under the record company Alfa Music. Since then he has released one album per year, selling several million copies each. His music has gained recognition throughout Asia, most notably in regions such as China, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, and in overseas Asian communities, winning more than 20 awards each year. He has sold over 25 million albums worldwide. He starred in Initial D (2005), for which he won Best Newcomer Actor in Golden Horse Awards, and was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by Hong Kong Film Awards for his role in Curse of the Golden Flower (2006). His career now extends into directing and running his own record company JVR Music. He has also endorsed various models of Media Players released by Onda in which he appears on the box, and his signature and likeness is printed on the back of certain models of these players.\n\n(From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou)\n\nCollection Includes:\n\nJay (2000)\nFantasy (2001)\nEight Dimensions(2002)\nYe Hui Mei(2003)\nCommon Jasmin Orange(2004)\nNovember's Chopin(2005)\nStill Fantasy(2006)\nOn The Run(2007)\n\nSecret (2007)\nHuo Yuan Jia\nGolden Armour\nHidden Track\n\nPlease seed as long as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa4530374ef8c113342fb1ef56f42f96aba08b22","amp;dn":"Jay+Chou+-+Entire+Collection+up+to+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa4530374ef8c113342fb1ef56f42f96aba08b22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,69,48,55,78,248,193,19,52,47,177,239,86,244,47,150,171,160,139,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
