Henry, Anthony W. Norman (AP, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nThe Encyclopedia of Hormones is a comprehensive reference work on hormones in vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant systems. It covers all aspects of hormones: their chemical structure and biological synthesis; the major physiological systems in which they operate; the cellular and subcellular site of their action; the nature of the signal transduction mechanisms used in the hormone's action; and the biological consequences of an excess or deficiency of the hormone.\r\n\r\nEach contributor is an expert in his or her field and has been recruited by one of 14 Associate Editors. The 300 articles that comprise this encyclopedia are arranged alphabetically. Each entry begins with a glossary of key terms that are compiled into a complete glossary for the entire work. Additionally, each entry includes 10-15 recent references to provide the reader with an entry into the scientific literature.\r\n\r\nThe Encyclopedia of Hormones is sure to be a valuable reference work for students and professional researchers interested in any aspect of the control of biological systems by hormonal signals.\r\n\r\nThe only source available with such comprehensive descriptions of hormones, their receptors, and their mechanisms of action\r\nFull coverage including vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant hormones\r\nIncludes the chemistry, synthesis, secretion, and biological actions of hormones\r\nThorough coverage of signal transduction mechanisms as they relate to hormones\r\nContributions from over 500 experts in the study of hormones\r\nWritten to be accesssible to non-endocrinologists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69d766e8585087ca0cfcbbc2b6150834f1c73877","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Hormones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69d766e8585087ca0cfcbbc2b6150834f1c73877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,215,102,232,88,80,135,202,12,252,187,194,182,21,8,52,241,199,56,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
