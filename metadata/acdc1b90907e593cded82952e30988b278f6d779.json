In particular, the following topics are addressed:\r\nâ€¢ Modeling and control of power generators (PMSGs, DFIGs);â€¢ Modeling and control of power electronics (converters, inverters); â€¢ Modeling and fault diagnosis of the transmission and distribution Grid; andâ€œdiv&gt;â€¢ Modelling and control of distributed power generation units (interconnected synchronous generators or photovoltaic units).\r\nBecause of the above coverage, members of the wider engineering community will find that the nonlinear control and estimation methods presented provide essential insights into the functioning of renewable energy power systems, while the academic community will find the book a valuable textbook for undergraduate or graduate courses on renewable energy systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acdc1b90907e593cded82952e30988b278f6d779","amp;dn":"Intelligent+Renewable+Energy+Systems+-+Modelling+and+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acdc1b90907e593cded82952e30988b278f6d779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,220,27,144,144,126,89,60,222,216,41,82,227,9,136,178,120,246,215,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
