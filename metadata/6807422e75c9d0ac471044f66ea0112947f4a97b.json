Buffett, after all, jostles with Bill Gates for the title of richest man in America and has built Berkshire Hathaway from a small textile concern into a multi-billion-dollar corporate mammoth. So how does he do it? O'Loughlin tackles the question enthusiastically, laying out Buffett's investing strategies, his management techniques and his unconventional wisdom. Much of it is already well known, of course, from Buffett's love of the cash-generating insurance business, to his hands-off managerial style, to his early passion for the ideas of value-investing guru Benjamin Graham. But the book is a useful distillation of everything business buffs know about the inscrutable Buffett. After the dot-com years, during which his plodding investing style went out of favor, it was he who emerged from the bust relatively unscathed. As O'Loughlin fawns, &quot;We may never see the like of Warren E. Buffett again.&quot;\nCopyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.
