The chorus in the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.\nThe anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches.\n\nSong Info :\n\nFile size : 2.74 MiB\nDuration : 2mn 59s\nOverall bit rate : 128 Kbps\nPerformer : Tony Britten\nTrack name : UEFA Champions League Anthem\n\nPlease Seed and leave a Comment....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6dcf03a68d731448220e7e10047fd034070352","amp;dn":"Tony+Britten+-+UEFA+Champions+League+Anthem+%5B128+kbps%5D+%7Bkrzzy%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6dcf03a68d731448220e7e10047fd034070352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,109,207,3,166,141,115,20,72,34,14,126,16,4,127,208,52,7,3,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
