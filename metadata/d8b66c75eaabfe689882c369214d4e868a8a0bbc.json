Well, Universal very cleverly didn't re-release those two original Motown compilations, in so far as compilations can be original, with the same track lists as those comprehensive, essential and bestselling vinyl albums we all bought back in the 70's and 80's, did they? Those with all hits, no fillers, and with a combined playing time of some 140 minutes excellent value for money? Oh no. They very discretely snuck in 14 'new' tracks, including 6 lesser-known recordings with The Supremes after Diana Ross had gone solo plus a couple of duets with The Temptations and The Four Tops. Great tracks - sure, of historical interest - absolutely, but as far as I'm aware none of them went gold. \n\nThe same number of tracks were consequently dropped including some of The Supremes' greatest hits like &quot;Forever Came Today&quot;, &quot;No Matter What Sign You Are&quot;, &quot;Some Things You Never Get Used To&quot; but most importantly their 1966 classic &quot;Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart&quot; (#9 Billboard Hot 100, #7 Billboard R&amp;B Singles), an essential recording that's been featured on every &quot;Definitive&quot;, &quot;Complete&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot; collection both before and since &quot;40 Golden Motown Greats&quot;.  There were now 24 tracks with The Supremes and, again, consequently just 16 with Diana Ross. And those who saw that familiar 'lips' cover and the title Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes: &quot;40 Golden Greats&quot; and naturally assumed that these were all recordings with the original Dreamgirls from their golden era were undoubtedly sorely disappointed when they realised that the album in fact only featured 18 tracks from the years 1964 to 1969 - 18 out of 40. Now that's clever marketing for you. Ross' 1981 album &quot;All The Great Hits&quot; enjoyed the same respectful treatment by Universal in 2000; same title, same cover art - different track selection. The current CD version features tracks that weren't included on either the original US or European Motown editions. &quot;40 Golden Motown Greats&quot; was in turn released twice with two different covers entirely, the second of which is still in print in the UK and sold as a pricey 'import' worldwide. \n\nWell done Universal Music. ...and now, some 10 years on, you wonder why people can't be bothered buying your CD's anymore....?\n\nSo, please find enclosed those two 'original' &quot;20 Golden Greats&quot; compilations in their entirety as released by Motown in the 1970's, plus those additional tracks from Universal's - if you pardon the expression - shoddy &quot;40 Golden Motown Greats&quot;. All in chronological order and all in all &quot;60 Golden Motown Greats&quot; with a total playing time of some 4 hours. Plus a few 'bonus' tracks, we all love those don't we, such as the four recordings from Ross' criminally overlooked 1978 album &quot;Ross&quot; and the full-length versions of classics like &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&quot;, &quot;Love Hangover&quot;, &quot;Upside Down&quot; and &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot;. All in 320 kbps quality, brilliant value for money if I may say so myself...... and as we all know, musically it doesn't get any better than this, these are milestones in the history of popular music and, although she may have had hits all through the 80's, 90's and 2000's, this is arguably still the finest decade in Ross' solo career, so....\n\n...enjoy and share with your fellow man. And woman.\n\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\n60 Golden Motown Greats \n=======================\n\nDisc 1 (The Supremes / Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes 1963-1972):\n\n01.
