Barbara Hershey stars as the real-life depression era orphan of the title, a charming, cheeky young woman who tramped the Deep South with a union organizer (David Carradine), a dandified New York con man (Barry Primus), and a blues-playing mechanic (Bernie Casey), turning her motley band into train-robbing outlaws. Scorsese was anxious to show his chops on a real Hollywood feature and does so admirably.\n\n  Starring: Barbara Hershy, David Carradine, Victor Argo, John Carradine, Bernie Casey, Marianne Dole.\n\n  Directed by: Martin Scorsese.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 28min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dbb638827ad73cf2adb4a9b5b23ccee0ddb1f5f","amp;dn":"Boxcar+Bertha+%281972%29+%28Barbara+Hershy%2C+David+Carradine%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dbb638827ad73cf2adb4a9b5b23ccee0ddb1f5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,187,99,136,39,173,115,207,42,219,74,155,91,35,204,238,13,219,31,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
