Contains a broad, unified introduction to the subject matter that will be of immediate practical value plus a foundation for more advanced study. New features include a discussion of liquid-crystal polymers, the Flory-Huggins theory, group-transfer polymerization, a quantitative treatment of Ziegler-Natta polymerization with three new worked-out examples and much more. End-of-chapter problems have been added along with practical illustrations of the material","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce64d233a0c17cffc086e6edee2da5ea4abd138","amp;dn":"Fundamental+Principles+of+Polymeric+Materials+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce64d233a0c17cffc086e6edee2da5ea4abd138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,230,77,35,58,12,23,207,252,8,110,110,222,226,218,94,164,171,209,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
