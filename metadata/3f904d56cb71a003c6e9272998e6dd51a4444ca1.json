Battling against the Heartless once more, the dedicated group of friends now find themselves up against an all-new enemy threat -- a mummy-wrapped ruler of unknown origin. Also fresh to the series is a brand new meter known as the &quot;Transformation Drive&quot; that allows players to merge with other team members to create more powerful versions of themselves. New costume designs, improved camera controls, and the answer to lingering plot questions from the first game are also included. Developed exclusively for the PlayStation 2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f904d56cb71a003c6e9272998e6dd51a4444ca1","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Hearts+2+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f904d56cb71a003c6e9272998e6dd51a4444ca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,144,77,86,203,113,160,3,198,233,39,41,152,230,221,81,164,68,76,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
