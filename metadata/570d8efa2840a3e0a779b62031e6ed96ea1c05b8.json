While less detailed than encyclopedic textbooks, it provides much more information than outline booklets. Clinical knowledge to enhance patient management, rather than the latest scientific advances is emphasized. For persons preparing for their board examination, certification or recertification, case-based presentations and numerous board examination-type single best-answer questions with annotated answers are provided. Abundant figures, images and tables are also included. The faculty authoring this book are all Mayo Clinic gastroenterologists and hepatologists who spend most of their time caring for patients and teaching in an academic environment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:570d8efa2840a3e0a779b62031e6ed96ea1c05b8","amp;dn":"Mayo+Clinic+Gastroenterology+and+Hepatology+Board+Review%2C+5E+%5BPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"570d8efa2840a3e0a779b62031e6ed96ea1c05b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,13,142,250,40,64,163,224,167,121,182,32,49,230,237,150,234,28,5,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
