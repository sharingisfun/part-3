Old West\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican saxophone master Joshua Redman and his pianist compatriot Brad Mehldau are long-time collaborators, but this compilation of originals and standards recorded live in Europe in 2011 is their first duo album. Theyâ€™re improvisationally inseparable on Charlie Parkerâ€™s Ornithology, as Redmanâ€™s tenor traces the shape of the tune while Mehldau capriciously deconstructs the harmony and rhythms. Thelonious Monkâ€™s In Walked Bud coolly massages a jazz theme famous enough to be mostly implied. A 16-minute The Nearness of You highlights Mehldauâ€™s harmonic adventurousness and features a tour-de-force unaccompanied break from Redman. And the chimingly catchy Mehldau rocker Old West brings out the best of Redmanâ€™s terse, rhythmically astute lyricism on soprano, and the composerâ€™s ability to stray into the distance and find his way home by roundabout routes. Always lyrical, the music nonetheless sometimes sounds at the edge of a precipice â€“ itâ€™s improv in the most exposed of situations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8fb17ab795995954a476757b861cd7fa6c29d0d","amp;dn":"Joshua+Redman+and+Brad+Mehldau+-+Nearness+%5Bmp3-320-2016%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8fb17ab795995954a476757b861cd7fa6c29d0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,251,23,171,121,89,149,149,74,71,103,87,184,97,205,127,166,194,157,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
