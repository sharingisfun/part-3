Written by a team of highly experienced computer security experts, the handbook provides handsÃ¢â‚¬â€œon tutorials exploring a range of current attack methods. The web browser has become the most popular and widely used computer &quot;program&quot; in the world. As the gateway to the Internet, it is part of the storefront to any business that operates online, but it is also one of the most vulnerable entry points of any system. With attacks on the rise, companies are increasingly employing browserÃ¢â‚¬â€œhardening techniques to protect the unique vulnerabilities inherent in all currently used browsers. The Browser HackerÃ¢â‚¬Â²s Handbook thoroughly covers complex security issues and explores relevant topics such as: Bypassing the Same Origin Policy ARP spoofing, social engineering, and phishing to access browsers DNS tunneling, attacking web applications, and proxyingÃ¢â‚¬â€all from the browser Exploiting the browser and its ecosystem (plugins and extensions) CrossÃ¢â‚¬â€œorigin attacks, including InterÃ¢â‚¬â€œprotocol Communication and Exploitation The Browser HackerÃ¢â‚¬Â²s Handbook is written with a professional security engagement in mind. Leveraging browsers as pivot points into a targetÃ¢â‚¬Â²s network should form an integral component into any social engineering or redÃ¢â‚¬â€œteam security assessment. This handbook provides a complete methodology to understand and structure your next browser penetration test.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdcbefeec40a52038e28129b82fe0a1ff5384c0a","amp;dn":"The+Browser+Hacker%27s+Handbook+2014+-+Wade+Alcorn%2CChristian+Frich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdcbefeec40a52038e28129b82fe0a1ff5384c0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,203,239,238,196,10,82,3,142,40,18,155,130,254,10,31,245,56,76,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
