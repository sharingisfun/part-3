The book teaches\nMATLAB as a technical programming language showing students how to\nwrite clean, efficient, and well-documented programs. It makes no\npretense at being a complete description of all of MATLAB's hundreds\nof functions. Instead, it teaches students how to locate any desired\nfunction with MATLAB's extensive on line help facilities. Overall,\nstudents develop problem-solving skills and are equipped for future\ncourses and careers using the power of MATLAB.\n\n\nMATLAB Programming for Engineers 4th edition\nBy: Stephen J.
