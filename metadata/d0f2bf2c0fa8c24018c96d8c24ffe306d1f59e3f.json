We waited a month for\nTuneUp Utilities 2015 to show up and it's been posted that it has\nbeen changed to AVG PC TuneUp 2015. So here is the release\nIt's still a great app, but don't expect anything innovative from\nAVG to add to this suite, it's TuneUp 2013 rebranded each year\n\nInstall avg_tuht_stf_all_2015_185.exe. After installation make\nsure AVG PC TuneUp 2015 isn't running, close down the front end\nif it auto launched after setup. Next copy over the precracked\ndll from the Crack folder, to the installed folder of AVG PC\nTuneUp 2015, making sure to overwrite the existing file. Now\njust import the Registration.reg into your registry by double\nclicking the file. You now have a fully registered and activated\nversion of AVG PC TuneUp 2015!\n\nOPTIONAL:\n\nYou can skip importing the registration file and use any info for\nregistration. It's recommended to use the Registration file, as\nthis has account registration step completed for you and also\nremoves some previous blacklisting from lamer keygen onlys. Use\na keygen only WILL ALWAYS result in blacklisting in a short time!\nMake sure to use the following format for the serial:\nXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX\nor any 35 digits you'd like\n\nThats it!
