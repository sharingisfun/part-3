(2015)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com..\n\ntarting out as a punk- and rap-influenced band, the Northern California group Papa Roach eventually grew into a straight-ahead hard rock ensemble with strong heavy metal leanings. Consisting of Coby Dick, Jerry Horton, Dave Buckner, and Tobin Esperance, Papa Roach formed in 1993 and began releasing EPs soon after, including 1994's Potatoes for Christmas and 1995's Caca Bonita. By 1996, the group had replaced original bassist Will James with Esperance and hired a new manager; the following year, Papa Roach released their first full-length album, Old Friends from Young Years, which became a surprise hit on local radio. \n\n\nGenre................: Alternattive Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Eleven Seven Music\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n\n01.Face Everything And Rise\n02.Skeletons\n03.Broken As Me\n04.Falling Apart\n05.Love Me Till It Hurts\n06.Never Have To Say Goodbye\n07.Gravity\n08.War Over Me\n09.Devil\n10.Warriors\n11.Hope For The Hopeless\n12.Fear Hate Love\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1816a84bf667e5b654d614012a79f110b86b1a4b","amp;dn":"Papa+Roach+-+F.E.A.R+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1816a84bf667e5b654d614012a79f110b86b1a4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,22,168,75,246,103,229,182,84,214,20,1,42,121,241,16,184,107,26,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
