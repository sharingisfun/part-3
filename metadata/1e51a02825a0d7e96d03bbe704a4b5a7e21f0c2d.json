I love this one.\n\nJohn Wayne quits the ring after killing an opponent. Returns to his native Ireland and falls in love with Maureen O&amp;#039;Hara (as usual).  Gets caught by the courting rules of the society at that time.  Just a great watchable movie.\n\nFull screen, stated as ripped from DVD, quality is very good, avi format, no subs.  Very long for its day.\n\nYou will see some of the same actors that worked with John Wayne in Fort Apache that I uploaded a few days ago.\n\n448x336\n2:09:19\nAudio Bit Rate: 114 kbps\nMP3\nVideo frame rate: 29 fps\nVideo data rate: 92 kbps\nVideo compression: DIVX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e51a02825a0d7e96d03bbe704a4b5a7e21f0c2d","amp;dn":"John+Wayne+-+The+Quiet+Man+%281952%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e51a02825a0d7e96d03bbe704a4b5a7e21f0c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,81,160,40,37,160,215,233,109,3,187,231,4,164,181,167,226,31,12,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
