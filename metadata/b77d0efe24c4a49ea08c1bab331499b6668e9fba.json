She explains how meat, fish, milk, and cheeseÃ¢â‚¬â€the very foods weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been taught to regard as the cornerstone of good nutritionÃ¢â‚¬â€are actually the culprits behind escalating rates of disease and the cause of dire, potentially permanent damage to our ecology. \nYet going meat- and dairy-free doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean suffering deprivation; to the contrary, The Kind Diet introduces irresistibly delicious food that satisfies on every levelÃ¢â‚¬â€it even includes amazing desserts to keep the most stubborn sweet tooth happy. Alicia also addresses the nutritional concerns faced by many who are new to a plant-based diet, and shows how to cover every nutritional base, from protein to calcium and beyond. \nAlicia knows that changing life-long dietary habits is a process, and that each person progresses at a different pace. For that reason, The Kind Diet encompasses 3 separate levels, from Flirting to Superhero. Flirts learn to dip a toe into the vegan pool, reducing their meat-eating and swapping out a few key foods for plant-based substitutes to see quickly how even small changes can reap big results. Vegans get to experience the life-altering effects of forgoing animal-products entirely, while still enjoying many convenience foods and meat substitutes in addition to the wonderful grains, vegetables and fruits that form the core of that diet. True enlightenment comes with the Superhero program, based on the principles of macrobiotics and built on a foundation of whole grains, vegetables, and other yummy foods that Alicia describes in detail. \nWhether your goal is to drop a few pounds, boost your energy and metabolism, or simply save the world, Alicia provides the encouragement, the information, and the tools you need to make the transition to a plant-based diet deliciously empowering.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77d0efe24c4a49ea08c1bab331499b6668e9fba","amp;dn":"The+Kind+Diet+A+Simple+Guide+to+Feeling+Great%2C+Losing+Weight%2C+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77d0efe24c4a49ea08c1bab331499b6668e9fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,125,14,254,36,196,164,158,160,140,27,171,51,20,153,182,102,142,159,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
