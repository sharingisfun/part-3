Until now, Toby has kept his ability to listen to people's surface thoughts a secret and the only one he has shared it with is his old counsellor and confidant, Dr. Ray Mercer (Colm Feore), prior to the series' first episode. While he crosses the city of Toronto in his ambulance with his partner Osman &quot;Oz&quot; Bey (Enis Esmer), Toby helps people in crisis and on the way come to terms with his own past. With the help of Detective Charlie Marks (Lisa Marcos) and his on-and-off girlfriend Olivia Fawcett (MylÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne Dinh-Robic), an E.R doctor, Toby realizes that his gift can serve to help other people.\n\nSeason Two (2011)\n\nIt's a year and a half later and Toby has finally comes to terms with his telepathic powers and is still working with his paramedic partner Osman Bey. After assisting with an undercover case investigated by the Integrated Investigative Bureau (a special unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) Toby reveals his gift to Sgt. Michelle McCluskey (Lauren Lee Smith). Despite her initial skepticism, she realizes that Toby's special abilities could be her team's secret weapon. So alongside his paramedic work Toby joins Michelle and other members of the IIB to help solve some of their most difficult and high profile cases ranging from suspicious homicides to cases of arms dealing. But the price to pay for having such a gift is the emotional and physical effects of delving into some of the most deranged criminal minds out there and it is his old flame Dr Olivia Fawcett who helps him deal with his problems.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=631457#pid631457&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=631457#pid631457&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t350 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t42 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t        16:9\nFrame rate : \t        23.976fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t13 + 4 Trailer + 1 TitlePic + 1 txt = 19\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n                        VISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dc34bde4d653d4f7135fd48fb708464606217c1","amp;dn":"The+Listener+-+Season+2+Complete+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dc34bde4d653d4f7135fd48fb708464606217c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,195,75,222,77,101,61,79,113,53,253,72,251,112,132,100,96,98,23,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
