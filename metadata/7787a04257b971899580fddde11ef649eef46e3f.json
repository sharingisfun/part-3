TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a four-piece from Madrid, Spain. So far theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve released three amazing, appropriately-named albums:\n\nToundra (I) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2009\n1) Bajamar\n2) Pleamar\n3) Medusa\n4) Ãƒâ€œrbita\n5) JaurÃƒÂ­a\n6) GÃƒÂ©nesis\n7) Tesalia\n\nToundra (II) - 2010\n1) Tchod\n2) Magreb\n3) Zanzibar\n4) VÃƒÂ¶land\n5) Danubio\n6) Koschei\n7) Bizancio\n\nToundra (III) - 2012\n1) Ara Caeli \n2) Cielo Negro\n3) Requiem\n4) Marte\n5) Lilim\n6) EspÃƒÂ­rita\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m offering these here to help promote what I feel is an unknown, but awesome, band to become well-known, especially since I couldn't find them on TPB. If you like Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Porcupine Tree, Storm Corrosion, Opeth, Goonies Never Say DieÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll love these Spaniards.\n\nIf you really like them, go find their bandcamp website and buy their albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ridiculously under-priced. I suspect that, unlike major labels, most of the album money will go directly to supporting the band itself. Also, if you get the chance, go see them play live (musicians usually get more money from live shows than album sales) and buy their merchandise.\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7787a04257b971899580fddde11ef649eef46e3f","amp;dn":"Toundra+%26ndash%3B+complete+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7787a04257b971899580fddde11ef649eef46e3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,135,160,66,87,185,113,137,149,128,253,221,225,30,246,73,238,244,110,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
