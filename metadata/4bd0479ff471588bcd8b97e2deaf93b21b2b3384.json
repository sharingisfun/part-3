Tolkien's fabled Middle-Earth universe with The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age. In it, players will be able to travel in the wake of the Fellowship with a unique structure that allows them to explore their own path while periodically intersecting with the major events of the films. Encounter the demonic Balrog in the mines of Moria, defend the fallen city of Osgiliath, or try to destroy Helm's Deep -- the choice is yours. Players can even customize their own hero or villain and upgrade them with an in-depth skill tree system that will increase their special abilities.\n\n\nDo you missing a game?
