In the Ripperâ€™s wake, terror swept through the streets of London s East End in the fall of 1888. As quickly as his nightmarish reign came, Saucy Jack vanished without a trace leaving future generations to speculate upon his identity and whereabouts. He was diabolical in a way never seen before a killer who taunted the police, came up with his own legendary monikers, and, ultimately, got away with his heinous crimes.\r\nMore than a century later, the man from hell continues to live on in the imaginations of readers everywhere and in some of the most spectacularly unnerving stories, both fiction and nonfiction, ever written. The Big Book of Jack the Ripper immerses you in the utterly chilling world of Red Jack s London, where his unprecedented evil still lurks.\r\n\r\nIncluding:\r\n. Legendary stories by Marie Belloc Lowndes, Robert Bloch, and Ellery Queen\r\n. Captivating essays from George Bernard Shaw, Stephen Hunter, and Peter Underwood\r\n. Riveting new stories by contemporary masters Jeffrey Deaver, Loren D. Estleman, Lyndsay Faye, and many more\r\n. Astonishing theories from the world s foremost Ripperologists\r\nFrom the Ripper Vault:\r\n. Demonic letters from Jack himself\r\n. Gruesome postmortem exams documenting all the bits and pieces of the cases\r\n. Harrowing witness statements taken on those hellish nights\r\n. Breaking newspaper accounts of the East End hysteriaâ€\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9687e5dbee5f060a4db6b43200eaaf60d3e1ea","amp;dn":"The+Big+Book+of+Jack+the+Ripper+-+Otto+Penzler+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9687e5dbee5f060a4db6b43200eaaf60d3e1ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,150,135,229,219,238,95,6,10,77,182,180,50,0,234,175,96,211,225,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
