Late Night Tales presents Sasha : Scene Delete (Continuous Mix) (01:15:00)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The first Late Night Tales release of 2016 is a very special project by Sasha.\r\n\r\n Imagine listening to music inspired by Frahm, Richter and Steve Reich, but made by one of the UKâ€™s leading house and techno DJs. Away from the hubbub of the club, the craziness of Ibiza, thereâ€™s a contemplative side to everybody. Forget the beats and the sweat and the billowing anthems; this quiet, undulating, at times pastoral piece is less about songs and anthems and more about texture and atmosphere. â€˜Scene Deleteâ€™ is a side of Sasha youâ€™ve never heard before. \r\n\r\n &quot;About three years ago, my collaborators David Gardner and ThermalBear and I wrote a song called â€˜Bring On The Nightâ€™. I sent it to Ultraista and within a few days she sent it back with this amazing vocal on, with Nigel Goodrich playing keyboards. We tried to do club mixes but we just couldnâ€™t get it right. So it sat there doing nothing. \r\n\r\n Tracks like this kept building up, until finally last summer my frustration boiled over. Weâ€™d made so many tunes that I couldnâ€™t remember the names of half of them: What was that thing with a bass sound and a string line? It drove me mental. At the same time as we were logging these tracks, I was listening to the Jon Hopkinsâ€™ Late Night Tales and I thought a lot of the music weâ€™d been working on was in the same vibe. So I sent the music over to Late Night Tales and they really liked it. \r\n\r\n Initially, I thought weâ€™d just do a Late Night Tales compilation with maybe a few pieces of my own music. But as we went through everything weâ€™d worked on in the last two years, we realised we had about 50 pieces of music. So we started editing and compiling: â€˜Scene Deleteâ€™ is the end result.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:838fbcebcf8874d471cd4f0631f278cb4eb86958","amp;dn":"Sasha+-+Scene+Delete+%282016%29+Album+%40+MP3+%2F+Electronica+-+Ambient","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"838fbcebcf8874d471cd4f0631f278cb4eb86958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,143,188,235,207,136,116,212,113,205,79,6,49,242,120,203,78,184,105,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
