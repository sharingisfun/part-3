Originally a new wave synthpop outfit, Ministry changed its style to industrial metal in the late 1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with its most successful album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992) and touring as part of the Lollapalooza festival.\n\nAfter 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2012. Ministry released a new album, Relapse, on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a world tour. Following the death of long time guitarist Mike Scaccia, Ministry released their final album From Beer to Eternity in September 2013, but still plan to tour in support of that album.\n\nEarly years and With Sympathy (1981Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1984)\nAl Jourgensen began Ministry in Chicago, Illinois in 1981. His first band prior to Ministry was Special Affect with Groovie Mann (of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult), drummer Harry Rushakoff (Concrete Blonde) and bassist Marty Sorenson. After that was the short-lived Silly Charmichaels, with Ben Krug, Tom Krug and Tom Wall (all of The Imports).\n\nThe original line-up of Ministry consisted mainly of Jourgensen (vocals and guitar), Stephen George (drums), Robert Roberts (keyboards), and John Davis (keyboards), although with a few personnel changes, the band's image would begin to focus more on Jourgensen and Stephen George. Ministry's original sound was essentially new wave synthpop that was more melodic and stylized than the aggressive music for which they would become known. Ministry released four 12&quot; singles on Wax Trax! Records from 1981 to 1984 (anthologized on Twelve Inch Singles (1981Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1984) that featured the club favorite &quot;Everyday Is Halloween&quot;.\n\nTheir first LP With Sympathy, was issued on Arista Records in 1983 and hit the upper 90s in the Billboard 200. The LP was well received by college radio fans initially and became common in many new wave album collections at the time. The music in With Sympathy and the singles Arista issued in association with it were a melodic type of synthpop and part of the new wave sound growing in popularity in the early 1980s. Songs from the LP were played live as an opening act for The Police during the Synchronicity Tour's North American leg, the band was well received by the large arena audiences. Jourgensen has expressed disappointment with some of Ministry's recordings during those early years. According to him, after signing the record contract, all artistic control of Ministry was &quot;handed&quot; over to other writers and producers. Some of his preferred recordings from that era were collected into the CD Early Trax (Rykodisc Records, 2004).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f32ff668ad7c96e50e4dee1bd33d401a0fe5245","amp;dn":"Ministry+-+Full+Length+Discography+%281982-2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f32ff668ad7c96e50e4dee1bd33d401a0fe5245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,50,255,102,138,215,201,110,80,228,222,225,189,51,212,1,160,254,82,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
