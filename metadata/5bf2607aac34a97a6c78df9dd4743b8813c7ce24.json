The numbering after DVDs can be approximated to the capacity of the discs. For example DVD-5 discs can hold 4.7GB on a one-sided, single layer disc and DVD-18 can hold 17.4GB on a dual-side, dual-layer disc.\n\nIn double layer (also referred to as dual layer) DVD-9 discs, two layers of standard DVD-5 are joined together with a transparent spacer and a thin reflector between the two. The bottom layer is read and written to in exactly the same manner as DVD-5. Reading and writing to the second layer is achieved by the laser focusing a fraction of a millimeter beyond the first recording layer.\n\nMORE INFO:\n\nMulti-Lang -&gt; open &quot;install.cfg&quot; (sequoia maindir) in a text editor and change:\n\n[install]\nLanguage=en_US\nAutoLanguage=0\n\nto:\n\n[install]\nLanguage=\nAutoLanguage=1\n\nSave -&gt; Now, sequoia auto-starts in yours system language!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf2607aac34a97a6c78df9dd4743b8813c7ce24","amp;dn":"MAGIX+Sequoia+v12.1.1.129+x32+x64+RETAiL+DVD9+-+V.R+-+KRock+%5Bds%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf2607aac34a97a6c78df9dd4743b8813c7ce24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,242,96,122,172,52,169,122,108,120,223,157,212,116,59,136,19,199,206,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
