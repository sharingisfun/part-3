They released their latest album, Exile on Mainstream, on October 2, 2007. The current members of the band are Rob Thomas, Paul Doucette, Brian Yale, and Kyle Cook. Rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor left the band in 2005, after performing on their first three studio albums. Rob Thomas is the principal songwriter and lead singer. Rob Thomas has created a well-established solo career for himself after releasing the album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Something to Be.\n\n\n\n\nYourself or Someone Like You \n\n\nYourself or Someone Like You, is the highly successful debut album by Matchbox Twenty released in 1996, contained five U.S. hit singles, and sold more than twelve million copies in the U.S. alone. It also went multi-platinum in Canada and Australia. The band's rock-based sound appealed to many listeners, despite a depressing theme with songs on topics such as loneliness, psychological abuse, humiliation, anger, and drunkenness.\n\nIn May 2005, New York resident Frank Torres sued Matchbox Twenty, claiming that the band had never sought his consent to use his photo on the album's cover. In the litigation, Torres claimed the photo was taken as he was walking down the street after being asked to pose. He also claimed the photo had caused him mental anguish. Torres justified the delay in suing Matchbox Twenty by claiming he had only seen the album photo within the last two years.\n\n\n Tracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Real World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50 \n2.\t&quot;Long Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n3.\t&quot;3 A.M.&quot; (Thomas, John Leslie Goff, John Joseph Stanley, Brian Yale) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 \n4.\t&quot;Push&quot; (Thomas, Matt Serletic) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59 \n5.\t&quot;Girl Like That&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n6.\t&quot;Back 2 Good&quot; (Thomas, Serletic) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:40 \n7.\t&quot;Damn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \n8.\t&quot;Argue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58 \n9.\t&quot;Kody&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 \n10.\t&quot;Busted&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15 \n11.\t&quot;Shame&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 \n12.\t&quot;Hang&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47 \n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:075133f9fd71259682e66c1d74d7ff0d00fd4149","amp;dn":"Matchbox+20+-+Yourself+or+Someone+Like+You+1996+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"075133f9fd71259682e66c1d74d7ff0d00fd4149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,81,51,249,253,113,37,150,130,230,108,29,116,215,255,13,0,253,65,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
