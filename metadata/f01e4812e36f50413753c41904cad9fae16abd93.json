As an oral and visual history that will enthrall viewers of all ages, the series pays tribute to these men and their remarkable skill, and their vivid recollections ensure that this series will be discussed and studied for many years to come. Filling four DVDs, these 11 first-season episodes run about 43 minutes in length, with each episode focusing on specific dogfights where &quot;you're in the pilot's seat&quot; for a breathtaking study of how these potentially deadly aerial encounters began, developed, and concluded. From the biplanes of World War I to the F-15 Eagles of the U.S. and Israeli Air Forces, the series re-creates legendary dogfights with computer-generated aircraft so authentically detailed (including accurate paint-schemes and military markings) that you can even see the rivets in their fuselages. With CGI pilots nestled in their cockpits, these airplanes look and move like the real thing, and while other details such as aircraft debris, flames, explosions, and crashes are rendered in video-game quality resolution (i.e., not state-of-the-art but sufficiently impressive) the aerial activity also includes gun-tracers, rockets, and missiles that are instantly convincing. As you learn about strategic maneuvers like the &quot;Thatch Weave&quot; and &quot;Rolling Scissors,&quot; the only thing missing is the G-forces you'd feel if you were actually flying the planes\n\n\n\n* Eleven episodes on four discs: MiG Alley, Air Ambush, Flying Tigers, Guadalcanal, Hell Over Hanoi, The Zero Killer, The Last Gunfighter, Death of the Japanese Navy, Long Odds, Dogfights of the Middle East, Hunt for the Bismarck\n\n\n* Feature-length pilot episode: &quot;Dogfights: Greatest Air Battles&quot;\n\n* Behind-the-scenes featurette: &quot;Dogfights: The Planes&quot;\n\n\n# Studio: A&amp;E Home Video\n\n# DVD Release Date: April 24, 2007\n\n# Run Time: 517 minutes\n\nFile Information\nFile Name: 11ea as 1.
