Diamond doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t romanticize traditional societiesÃ¢â‚¬â€after all, we are shocked by some of their practicesÃ¢â‚¬â€but he finds that their solutions to universal human problems such as child rearing, elder care, dispute resolution, risk, and physical fitness have much to teach us. A characteristically provocative, enlightening, and entertaining book, The World Until Yesterday will be essential and delightful reading.\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50427dec37b3633ee0daa2e4003dbf00ac5eaed1","amp;dn":"Jared+Diamond+-+The+world+until+yesterday.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50427dec37b3633ee0daa2e4003dbf00ac5eaed1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,66,125,236,55,179,99,62,224,218,162,228,0,61,191,0,172,94,174,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
