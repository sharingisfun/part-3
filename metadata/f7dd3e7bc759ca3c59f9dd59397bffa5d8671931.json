The group consisted of lead singer Veronica Bennett (later known as Ronnie Spector); her older sister, Estelle Bennett; and their cousin Nedra Talley. The group began singing as teenagers in Spanish Harlem, where they grew up, with their official recording career beginning at Colpix Records in 1961.\n\nIn March 1963 the group was signed by Phil Spector's Philles Records, where they reached the peak of their success.\n\nBecoming one of the most popular girl groups of the 1960s, they placed a total of eight songs on the Billboard Top 100, five of which became top forty-hits. Some of the group's most famous songs include &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;, &quot;(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up&quot;, and &quot;Walking in the Rain.\n\nIn late 1964 the group released their only studio album, the now classic Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica, which ranked number 427 on Rolling Stone's &quot;Five-Hundred Greatest Albums of All Time\n\n\nAlbum: Very Best Of The Ronettes\n\nReleased: 2011\n\nStyle: Pop\n\nFormat: MP3 320Kbps\n\nSize: 127 Mb\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Why DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t They Let Us Fall In Love\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Be My Baby\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Baby, I Love You\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (The Best Part Of) BreakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Up\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ So Young\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Do I Love You\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Walking In The Rain\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I Wonder\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When I Saw You\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ You Baby\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Born To Be Together\n12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Is This What I Get For Loving You\n13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Paradise\n14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Here I Sit\n15 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I Wish I Never Saw The Sunshine\n16 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Everything Under The Sun\n17 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I Can Hear Music\n18 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ You Came, You Saw, You Conquered\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7dd3e7bc759ca3c59f9dd59397bffa5d8671931","amp;dn":"The+Ronettes+Be+My+Baby+Very+Best+Of+The+Ronettes+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7dd3e7bc759ca3c59f9dd59397bffa5d8671931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,221,62,123,199,89,202,60,89,249,221,89,57,123,255,165,216,103,25,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
