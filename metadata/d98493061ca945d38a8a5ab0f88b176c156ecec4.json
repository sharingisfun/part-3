It sees Moby following a similar direction to that of his previous album Play, sampling old field recordings of negro spirituals and combining them with mellow dance beats. However, 18 features a generally sadder tone than that of Play. The album also sees Moby beginning to branch off into alternative rock (&quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot;, &quot;Great Escape&quot;, &quot;Extreme Ways&quot;, &quot;Harbour&quot;). Critical response to this album was positive to mixed, with many critics feeling it was too much of a retread of his previous releases and lacked inspiration. The most successful song on the album was the single &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot;, which reached #11 on the UK charts. The album features guest appearances by Azure Ray, MC Lyte, Angie Stone, and SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Claude Walls - Admittedly, 18 isn't a million style miles away from its predecessor, but this can only be a good thing. If it ain't broke (and let's face it, Play was a pretty hole-free record all told), then don't fix it. Hence the dominance here of Moby's heartbreaking way with strings, pianos and those sampled gospel vocals he's so cleverly made his own. \n&quot;In My Heart&quot; is familiar territory: a mournful blues voice sat astride the epic swell of military drums and tear jerking symphonia, while further tales of love gone bad surface on the bass-driven &quot;One of These Mornings&quot; and the subtle house simmer of &quot;Another Woman&quot;. Is there anyone else out there that can do grief you can dance to? Thankfully &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; does shed a little optimism, and there are some cool collaborations here too. Sinead O'Connor lends fragile breath to &quot;Harbour&quot; while MC Lyte and Angie Stone bring sassiness to the funky hip-hop anthem, &quot;Jam for the Ladies&quot;. Welcome back, little man.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] We Are All Made Of Stars\n[02] In This World\t\t\t- Featuring Jennifer Price\n[03] In My Heart\n[04] Great Escape\t\t\t- Featuring Azure Ray\n[05] Signs Of Love\n[06] One Of These Mornings\t\t- Featuring Patti LaBelle\n[07] Another Woman\t\t\t- Featuring Barbara Lynn\n[08] Fireworks\n[09] Extreme Ways\n[10] Jam For The Ladies\t\t- Featuring MC Lyte &amp; Angie Stone\n[11] Sunday (The Day B4 My Birthday) - Featuring Sylvia Robinson\n[12] 18\n[13] Sleep Alone\n[14] At Least We Tried\t\t- Featuring Freedom Bremner\n[15] Harbour\t\t\t- Featuring SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor\n[16] Look Back In\n[17] The Rafters\n[18] I'm Not Worried At All\n\n\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 01h:11m:17s\n\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 174mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t&gt;  Electronica Dance\n\nReleased          &gt; 14 May 2002\n\nRecord Company\t&gt; V2 Records BMG\n\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://moby.com \n\t\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d98493061ca945d38a8a5ab0f88b176c156ecec4","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+18+-+Moby+-+174mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d98493061ca945d38a8a5ab0f88b176c156ecec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,132,147,6,28,169,69,211,138,138,90,176,248,139,23,108,21,110,206,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
