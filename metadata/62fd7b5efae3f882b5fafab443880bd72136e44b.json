Some of their most popular songs include &quot;Name&quot; from 1995's A Boy Named Goo, &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Slide&quot; from 1998's Dizzy Up The Girl, which produced five top-10 singles, and &quot;Here Is Gone&quot; and &quot;Big Machine&quot; from 2002's Gutterflower. The Goo Goo Dolls have 14 top-10 singles[2] and have sold nearly 9 million albums in the United States alone.\n\n\nThe Goo Goo Dolls were originally called The Sex Maggots[4] which was changed when a promoter refused to book them. The band's original line-up included John Rzeznik (vocals, guitar), Robby Takac (vocals, bass guitar) and George Tutuska (drums, percussion). In the beginning, John would not sing, due to his shyness. Takac and Tutuska had been long-time friends in school and met Rzeznik while he was playing in the band The Beaumonts with TakacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cousin.[5] The trio picked their name from a True Detective ad for a toy called a Goo Goo Doll.[6] &quot;We were young and we were a garage band not trying to get a deal. We had a gig that night and needed a name. It's the best we came up with, and for some reason it stuck. If I had five more minutes, I definitely would have picked a better name&quot; John stated. With Takac as their lead singer, the band released their first album, Goo Goo Dolls in 1987 on Mercenary Records, but was picked up in 1988 by Celluloid Records, a larger record company. The band released its second album, Jed, in 1989 after moving to Los Angeles.[7]\n\nThe band released its third album, Hold Me Up, in 1990 and featured Rzeznik as the lead vocalist on five tracks, including the single, &quot;There You Are&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as well their then concert favorite, Two Days in February. Despite being earlier dismissed as having a sound too similar to The Replacements, as well as being embraced by local college radio and punk scenes (including playing such venues as CBGB), the Goo Goo Dolls' third release had incorporated elements of heavy metal, pop rock, and punk rock. In 1991, the song &quot;I'm Awake Now&quot; was recorded for the soundtrack of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.\n\nSuperstar Car Wash, released in 1993, received significant media attention. The critical success and encouraging sales of their last album resulted in a larger budget from Metal Blade Records. The album was partially recorded in Metalworks Studio in Mississauga, Ontario. &quot;We Are the Normal&quot; (the single for which Rzeznik asked frontman Paul Westerberg of The Replacements to write the lyrics), received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, while its video was displayed on MTV's 120 Minutes program. &quot;Fallin' Down&quot; made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of Pauly Shore's hit film Son in Law.\n\nShortly after recording the band's fifth album A Boy Named Goo, George Tutuska was kicked out of the band. The band moved forward from this December 31, 1994 incident, hiring Mike Malinin in 1995, and toured rigorously.\n\nA Boy Named Goo had a catchy rock sound, and became one of most successful alternative rock albums of mid-90's. It sold modestly in this time; however, it was not until the release of the single &quot;Name&quot; that the band experienced any viable commercial success. A Boy Named Goo became the first album in Metal Blade history to achieve double-platinum status. This success, however, proved bittersweet, as the band found themselves in a legal battle with Metal Blade records. The band filed suit against Metal Blade, claiming they had not earned any royalties from their albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sales, which was attributed to a &quot;grossly unfair, one-sided and unenforceable contract&quot; which had been signed by the band in 1987.[8] The two sides reached a settlement which had the band signed to the Metal Blade's distributing label, Warner Bros. Records, under which the band released their sixth album, Dizzy Up the Girl, in 1998.[9] The undisputed success of &quot;Name&quot; marked a fundamental change in the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound toward a more polished, commercial direction. It was &quot;Name&quot; that had made the band popular and they were able to make a guest appearance on 90210 and even present an Award to Michael Jackson.\n\nRzeznik was approached to write a song for the City of Angels soundtrack, and the end product was &quot;Iris&quot;. This song propelled the band to stardom, as it stayed on top of Billboard Hot 100 Airplay charts for a record-breaking 18 weeks, and was nominated for three Grammys that year. According to several interviews with Rzeznik, he was experiencing serious bouts of writer's block when he was approached, and was on the verge of quitting the band days before he wrote the song that would launch the band to worldwide fame.[10]\n\n&quot;Iris&quot; was included on the triple-platinum Dizzy Up the Girl, and was among Top-Ten hits &quot;Slide&quot;, &quot;Black Balloon&quot;, &quot;Broadway&quot;, and &quot;Dizzy&quot; from the same album. The new, polished sound garnered legions of new fans, many of whom had not followed the band before their mainstream success. Most of the Goo Goo Dolls concerts feature few, if any, songs the band wrote before 1995, reflecting the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more mainstream sound. In 2001, the Goos released their first ever compilation CD, What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art &amp; Commerce. Next, Gutterflower (2002) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the last longplay in spirit of America, with dark lyrical undertones from Rzeznik's divorceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½achieved gold certification, producing the hits &quot;Here Is Gone&quot;, &quot;Sympathy&quot;, and &quot;Big Machine&quot;. On July 4, 2004, the band performed a free concert in their hometown of Buffalo, continuing through a deluge of rain that can be seen on the DVD released later that year. The DVD also contained a studio version of the Goo Goo Dolls' cover of &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; by Supertramp. The single reached the top of the Adult Top 40 chart in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperstar Car Wash 1993\n\n\nSuperstar Car Wash is the fourth studio album by the Goo Goo Dolls, released in February, 1993 on Warner Bros. Johnny Rzeznik wrote the song &quot;We Are the Normal&quot; with his idol, The Replacements' singer Paul Westerberg. The two corresponded by mail but never sat in a studio together. The song &quot;Fallin' Down&quot; was featured in the 1993 Pauly Shore movie Son In Law. Also, the song &quot;So Far Away&quot; was originally written and recorded with the title &quot;Dancing In Your Blood&quot;; the song had the same basic structure, but different lyrics, more minimal instrumentation, and a slightly different melody. Superstar Car Wash, or simply &quot;SSCW&quot;, marks the end of the Takac, grungier era, and the beginning of the Rzeznik, more polished era. Superstar Car Wash was an actual car washing business on William Street just outside the downtown region of Buffalo, the hometown of the band.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Fallin' Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n2.\t&quot;Lucky Star&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n3.\t&quot;Cuz You're Gone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n4.\t&quot;Don't Worry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n5.\t&quot;Girl Right Next to Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n6.\t&quot;Domino&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36\n7.\t&quot;We Are the Normal&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n8.\t&quot;String of Lies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n9.\t&quot;Another Second Time Around&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n10.\t&quot;Stop the World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n11.\t&quot;Already There&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n12.\t&quot;On the Lie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n13.\t&quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n14.\t&quot;So Far Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Boy Named Goo 1995\n\n\nA Boy Named Goo, sometimes referred to as ABNG, is the fifth studio album by the Goo Goo Dolls, released in 1995 on Warner Bros. Records.\n\nThis is the Goo Goo Dolls' last studio album with George Tutuska on drums; he was replaced by current drummer Mike Malinin just before the album was released. This album is the Goo Goo Dolls first studio album not to have fourteen tracks. The song &quot;Stand Alone&quot; was written by George Tutuska, and because Johnny Rzeznik didn't want to exploit George's efforts after his dismissal, the song was only included on a promo version of the album. On the wide-release version, it is replaced with &quot;Disconnected&quot; and &quot;Slave Girl.&quot; On the same promo, &quot;Ain't That Unusual&quot; was labeled as &quot;Someday.&quot; The two replacement songs are covers of songs by defunct Buffalo and Sydney, punk bands The Enemies and Lime Spiders.\n\nThe song &quot;Name&quot; is well-known as the Goo Goo Dolls' first hit. This was &quot;quite accidentally,&quot; according to lead singer Johnny Rzeznik. It also marked the band's last album with the Metal Blade Records imprint.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Long Way Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n2.\t&quot;Burnin' Up&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n3.\t&quot;Naked&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n4.\t&quot;Flat Top&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n5.\t&quot;Impersonality&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n6.\t&quot;Name&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n7.\t&quot;Only One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n8.\t&quot;Somethin' Bad&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n9.\t&quot;Ain't That Unusual&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n10.\t&quot;So Long&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33\n11.\t&quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; (Rzeznik, Takac, Tutuska) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n12.\t&quot;Disconnected&quot; (The Enemies cover) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n13.\t&quot;Slave Girl&quot; (Lime Spiders cover) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDizzy Up The Girl 1998\n\n\nDizzy Up the Girl is the sixth album by Goo Goo Dolls, released in 1998.\n\nIn most parts of the world, Dizzy Up the Girl is the Goo Goo Dolls' most successful album to date, selling over 3 million copies (3x platinum certified). The success of Dizzy Up the Girl can arguably be attributed to the rock ballad &quot;Iris&quot;, which was also included in the soundtrack album of the film City of Angels. &quot;Iris&quot; immediately reached #1 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart upon its release in March from the City of Angels soundtrack, and stayed on top for 18 weeks, setting a record that still stands as of June 2011. The song also reached #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, along with several other charts in the U.S and U.K, and included 3 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn addition to the huge success of &quot;Iris&quot; (US #9), Dizzy Up the Girl featured three additional top forty singles, with the songs &quot;Slide&quot; (US #8), &quot;Broadway&quot; (US #24), and &quot;Black Balloon&quot; (US #16). The album also produced the moderately popular song &quot;Dizzy&quot; (US #108), which has since become a fan favorite. Along with top forty single status, music videos for all five singles reached VH1's Top 20 Music Videos chart upon release.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Dizzy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n2.\t&quot;Slide&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n3.\t&quot;Broadway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n4.\t&quot;January Friend&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n5.\t&quot;Black Balloon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n6.\t&quot;Bullet Proof&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n7.\t&quot;Amigone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15 (Takac)\n8.\t&quot;All Eyes on Me&quot; (Rzeznik, Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n9.\t&quot;Full Forever&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n10.\t&quot;Acoustic #3&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:56\n11.\t&quot;Iris&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n12.\t&quot;Extra Pale&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:10\n13.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Hate This Place&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGutterflower 2002\n\n\n\nGutterflower is the seventh studio album by Goo Goo Dolls, released in 2002.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Big Machine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n2.\t&quot;Think About Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n3.\t&quot;Here Is Gone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n4.\t&quot;You Never Know&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n5.\t&quot;What a Scene&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n6.\t&quot;Up, Up, Up&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n7.\t&quot;It's Over&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n8.\t&quot;Sympathy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n9.\t&quot;What Do You Need?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n10.\t&quot;Smash&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27\n11.\t&quot;Tucked Away&quot; (Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n12.\t&quot;Truth Is a Whisper&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet love In 2006\n\n\n\nLet Love In is the Goo Goo Dolls' eighth studio album. &quot;Better Days&quot;, which was released as a single late in 2005, appears on the album, along with a cover of the Supertramp song, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Stay with You&quot; (Glen Ballard, Rzeznik) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n2.\t&quot;Let Love In&quot; (Ballard, Rzeznik, Gregg Wattenberg) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n3.\t&quot;Feel the Silence&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n4.\t&quot;Better Days&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n5.\t&quot;Without You Here&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n6.\t&quot;Listen&quot; (Rzeznik, Robby Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n7.\t&quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; (Rick Davies/Roger Hodgson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n8.\t&quot;Can't Let It Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n9.\t&quot;We'll Be Here (When You're Gone)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n10.\t&quot;Strange Love&quot; (Rzeznik, Takac) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n11.\t&quot;Become&quot; (Ballard, Rzeznik) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits Volume One: The Singles \n\n\nGreatest Hits Volume One: The Singles is the eleventh album by The Goo Goo Dolls and is a greatest hits album containing fourteen previously released tracks, including their newest, &quot;Before It's Too Late&quot;, from the Transformers motion picture.

It was released on August 28, 2010 in Australia and on August 31 in North America through Warner Bros. Records.\n\nThe recording process took place during the spring to fall of 2009 in the GCR Audio studio in Buffalo and &quot;the Ark&quot; in Los Angeles, with producer Tim Palmer. A single had been originally slated to be released in November 2009 with an album release in February 2010, but the band went back into the studio in January 2010. According to lead singer and guitarist John Rzeznik, this was done to make further improvements on what they had previously thought had been a finished record.[3]\n\nSeveral producers were brought in to assist on the production process, including Butch Vig, John Fields, Paul David Hager[4] and Rob Cavallo.[5] Something for the Rest of Us will be the third Goo Goo Dolls studio album that Cavallo has produced (Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower).\n\nWhen asked about the length of time between albums, Rzeznik admitted it was a mix of songwriting issues as well as taking time out for personal reasons; &quot;I wanted to really dig deep and there are a million songs I threw away, like, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNah, it's not good enough. I wanna do something different. I wanna do something better, go deeper. I also wanted to have a life with my girlfriend for a while.
