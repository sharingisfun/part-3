The special edition\nis jam-packed with extensive bonus material. The\naudio portion boasts six previously unreleased and\nunavailable tracks, including an acoustic cover of\nChris Isaak&amp;#039;s &quot;Wicked Game,&quot; recorded live for a\nCanadian radio performance earlier this year. The\nbonus DVD features all four music videos from Come\nWhat(ever) May: &quot;30/30-150,&quot; &quot;Through Glass,&quot;\n&quot;sillyworld&quot; and the band&amp;#039;s latest &quot;Made of Scars.&quot;\nIn addition, the DVD includes a never-before-seen\nfull concert performance. Filmed in October 2006 in\nMoscow at the RAMP awards, the concert documents\nStone Sour&amp;#039;s first and only visit to Russia, a\nmust-have for fans.\n\n&quot;Now before all of you fans get upset about a\nre-release, (because I know how you are), let me\njust say that I am an avid music fan and a record\ncollector. That&amp;#039;s why, when the decision was made to\nrelease a special edition, we knew that it had to be\njust that: special,&quot; says guitarist Josh Rand. &quot;We\nadded everything we could possibly get our hands on,\nincluding an entire show from Russia, making it only\nthe greatest special edition ever! You guys are\ngonna love it!&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d977c0f0eb5b2b90dc98e1f4bae1c3e37753fc","amp;dn":"Stone_Sour-Come_What%28Ever%29_May-%28Special_Edition%29-2007-uF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d977c0f0eb5b2b90dc98e1f4bae1c3e37753fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,217,119,192,240,235,91,43,144,220,152,225,244,186,225,195,227,119,83,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
