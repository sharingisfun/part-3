This was the first time in the award's history that a debutant had won.\n\nHis second novel, A Time for Everything (2004), partly retells certain parts of the Bible, as well as the history of angels on earth. The book won a number of awards, and was nominated for the Nordic Council's Literature Prize. It was also nominated \nfor the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. It has been called a &quot;strange, uneven, and marvelous book&quot; by The New York Review of Books.\n\nThe Min Kamp series is currently being translated into numerous languages. The earliest books have already been published to  great critical acclaim in Denmark, Sweden, and several other countries. The first has been translated into English by Don Bartlett for publication by Archipelago Press (US) and Harvill Secker (UK), and has been retitled A Death in the Family . In a long and largely positive review of the first Min Kamp books, James Wood of The New Yorker wrote that &quot;There is something ceaselessly compelling about KnausgaardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book: even when I was bored, I was interested.&quot; In a review of Book 2: A Man in Love in The New York Times, Leland de la Durantaye called the My Struggle series &quot;breathtakingly good&quot; and compared it to Marcel ProustÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s In Search of Lost Time. In a review of Book 3: Boyhood Island in the Times Literary Supplement, Thomas Meaney reflected on the differences between Proust and Knausgaard, and wrote about the philosophy behind the Min Kamp books.\n\n\nThe torrent contains following books:\n\n* A Time for Everything -- Mobi\n\n* My Struggle - Book 1 -- ePUB\n\n* My Struggle - Book 2 -- ePUB\n\n\nRead the following article, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ove_Knausg%C3%A5rd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ove_Knausg%C3%A5rd&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/08/13/120813crbo_books_wood?currentPage=all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/08/13/120813crbo_books_wood?currentPage=all&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newrepublic.com/article/117245/karl-ove-knausgaard-interview-literary-star-struggles-regret&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newrepublic.com/article/117245/karl-ove-knausgaard-interview-literary-star-struggles-regret&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/12/26/completely-without-dignity-an-interview-with-karl-ove-knausgaard/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/12/26/completely-without-dignity-an-interview-with-karl-ove-knausgaard/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5291ca898d5e0308c1e5f6082888d95165534602","amp;dn":"Karl+Ove+Knausgaard+-+Norwegian+Author+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5291ca898d5e0308c1e5f6082888d95165534602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,145,202,137,141,94,3,8,193,229,246,8,40,136,217,81,101,83,70,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
