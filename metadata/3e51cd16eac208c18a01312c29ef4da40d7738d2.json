Unlike most of the studio sessions from this time, Montgomery gets plenty of room for his single-string work as well as his famous octaves, and both techniques find him in full, mature bloom, needing fewer notes in which to say more (Smith, of course, is precisely the opposite). All but one of the tracks on the original LP find Smith and Montgomery interacting only with themselves, the drums of Grady Tate, and the congas of Ray Barretto; Roger Miller's &quot;King of the Road&quot; (not often covered by jazzers) and Montgomery's &quot;O.G.D.&quot; (later known as &quot;Road Song&quot;) come off best. Oliver Nelson's big band makes a sole appearance with a swaggering chart of &quot;Milestones.&quot; Though Dynamic Duo is probably the priority purchase by a hairsbreadth margin, you'll need to have both that album and Further Adventures eventually. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - King of the Road\n02 - Maybe September\n03 - Road Song\n04 - Call Me\n05 - Milestones\n06 - Mellow Mood\n07 - 'Round Midnight\n\nEnjoy and share!
