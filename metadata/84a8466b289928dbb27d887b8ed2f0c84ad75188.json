He elucidates how cultural evolution differs from biological evolution, and how it further transformed our bodies during the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. Lieberman illuminates how these ongoing changes have brought many benefits, but also have created novel conditions to which our bodies are not entirely adapted, resulting in a growing incidence of obesity and new but avoidable diseases, including type-2 diabetes. He proposes that many of these chronic illnesses persist and in some cases are intensifying because of &quot;dysevolution,&quot; a pernicious dynamic whereby only the symptoms rather than the causes of these maladies are treated. And finallyÃ¢â‚¬â€provocativelyÃ¢â‚¬â€he advocates the use of evolutionary information to help nudge, push, and sometimes oblige us to create a more salubrious environment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84a8466b289928dbb27d887b8ed2f0c84ad75188","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+The+Human+Body+-+Daniel+E.+Lieberman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84a8466b289928dbb27d887b8ed2f0c84ad75188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,168,70,107,40,153,40,219,178,125,136,123,142,210,240,200,74,215,81,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
