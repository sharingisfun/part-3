Bloomfield\n2013\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1118237765\nISBN-13: 978-1118237762\nPDF \n592 pages \n37.2 MB\n\nThis book uses familiar objects to introduce basic physics concepts, demonstrating the excitement and relevance to professionals in a variety of technical fields. Because its structure is defined by real-life examples, this book explores concepts as they are needed and then revisits them later on when they reappear in other objects. It integrates case studies throughout the chapters to easily convey an understanding and appreciation for physics. For example, discussions of skating, falling balls, and bumper cars are included to explain the Laws of Motion. Air conditioners and automobiles are used to explore thermodynamics. Engineers, architects, and professionals in other technical fields will benefit from the material that connects science to our everyday world.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2cd53e70eb264990d63dae23af264044ba6864","amp;dn":"How+Things+Work+The+Physics+of+Everyday+Life+2013+-+Louis+A.+Blo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da2cd53e70eb264990d63dae23af264044ba6864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,44,213,62,112,235,38,73,144,214,61,174,35,175,38,64,68,186,104,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
