For drawings or photo work, for print or web graphics, it's the perfect choice. Xara Designer photo handling beats other graphics programs on many fronts: It's much, much faster, produces files that can be 10x or more smaller. It can handle multiple very high resolution images with ease, even on a modest PC. Being entirely object oriented means completely non-destructive photo editing, and uses a fraction of the RAM required by other products. Xara Designer offers unique non-destructive editing of photos - that means you can edit your photo as many times as you like without the loss of quality that is normal in other photo programs. Designer is also unique in the way it handles and stores photos (with lossless vector-based photo editing, combined with embedding the original JPEG) which means that files containing photos can be anywhere from 3 to 100 times smaller than with other programs.\n\nXara Designer has the world's most sophisticated, highest performance vector rendering engine. Quite simply this makes it the fastest graphics software to be found. Xara Designer's Direct Action Tools allow you to create effects such as transparency, shadows, bevels or gradient fills in an interactive, fast and intuitive way. No distracting dialogs - simply drag on the object! Many tasks in Xara Designer benefit from being able to use the drag and drop principle, which is the most intuitive way of working and a great time saver. It also supports drag and drop import of files, such as photos. Instead of dragging outlines when you draw, move, rotate or resize objects, Designer offers solid live object manipulation. Only Designer is fast enough to do this on complex vector graphics.\n\nBeing able to change what you have done is vital in a graphics package. Xara Designer allows unlimited undo, making experimentation easy. The Zoom tool allows magnification up to 25,000%, perfect for detailed work. And it's super-fast and resolution independent too. If this image was created in Photoshop with the same detail, the file would be 2000 x 3000 inches, take hundreds of megabytes of memory and file space. As a vector design it takes just 180Kbytes! Xara introduced the world's first vector anti-aliasing to bring maximum screen quality and is still a pioneer with the fastest, highest quality anti-aliasing available in any drawing program.\n\nXara Designer Pro (formerly Xtreme Pro) is our top of the range product and includes all the features and templates of Web Designer and Photo &amp; Graphic Designer. Plus it adds extra features that Pro designers need including support for PDF/X, PANTONEÃ‚Â® and color separations, multi-core processor support for extra speed, enhanced import/export filters, a pro version of the photo panorama tool and more.\n\nXara Designer Pro includes a complete 'website creation' feature that enables you to design multi-page websites with ease, including mouseover and pop-up effects, navbars and menus, animations and widgets. One click preview and ftp upload included. It's the world's most advanced WYSIWYG web page layout - and with no HTML skills required! Xara Photo and Graphic Designer and Designer Pro offer a genuinely easy way to create really efficient Flash animations.\n\nXara Designer Pro gives you total design freedom - using drag and drop you can literally place anything, anywhere on the page. And things which are normally difficult to achieve in HTML are a snap in Xara Designer Pro - for example text with curved edges, text or graphics at an angle, text flowing around objects - no problem! But Designer Pro has some clever tricks too, to make things easier for you - here's just a few of the things that will save you time and trouble: Liquid text flow around objects; easy mouseover, thumbnail and pop-up creation; automatic adjustment of photos to the correct web resolution; one-click change of site wide theme colors and shades; automatic color matching of imported objects such as buttons; and buttons and text panels that automatically stretch as you change the text.\n\nWorking with industry standards is vital, so Xara Designer Pro sites are W3C compliant, cross browser compatible (IE 5.5, Firefox, Safari, Chrome) and XHTML, CSS standards based.\nDesigner offers support for a huge range of file formats, making it easy to exchange your work with other users and programs. This includes common bitmap types (eg GIF, JPEG, BMP, PNG, TIFF, PSD, and RAW photos) and key vector types (eg PDF and AI/EPS, and EMF/WMF). For text Xara Designer supports RTF (Rich Text Format) and for websites HTML and Flash.\nXara Designer has full support for importing and exporting Adobe PhotoshopÃ‚Â® PSD files including layer support. Xara Designer offers industry leading export of super-clean, very compact PDF files (including support for graduated color fills and flat / graduated transparency). Combined with the PDF import feature, this provides another way to interchange files.\n\nXara Designer Pro offers the ability to produce CMYK color separations. This includes on-screen preview of CMYK and spot color plates, PANTONEÃ‚Â® color support, spot colors, on-screen printer gamut preview and a lot more.\nXara Designer Pro supports XPS export (and has a beta XPS import filter). This is an entirely new Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpage descriptionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ file format invented by Microsoft that's vector based, and so is ideal as a resolution-independent portable document format.\n\n\nPlatform : Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 8.1\nLanguage : English\n\n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES:]\n================\nRead &quot;Flaubert Release-Readme!.txt&quot;\n\n\nNOTE: Keygens, patches, Activators, Cracks, Loaders etc. are always scanned with Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 Latest Version to Avoid Virus\n     issues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7127f16a39d3a0fa2f95ee543245f50ec6c71e24","amp;dn":"Xara+Photo+and+Graphic+Designer+v10.1.0.34843+Cracked-F4CG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7127f16a39d3a0fa2f95ee543245f50ec6c71e24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,39,241,106,57,211,160,250,47,149,238,84,50,69,245,14,198,199,30,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
