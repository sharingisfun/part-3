Snow Patrol are one of the biggest and boldest bands of the past decade. Over 15 years and five studio albums, the part Irish, part Scottish five piece have sketched heart-bruised ballads and arm-around-your-best-mate festival anthems, radio hits and moments of painful introspection. All of these have been gathered together for Up To Now, a 30 track, double album of singles, cover versions, rarities, album tracks and a handful of new songs. From their formation in Scotland in 1994, the band's hard-earned rise has seen them become one of the world's biggest bands, culminating in them selling over 10 million copies of their last three albums!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1d9bbc5c33862f7bdac354e428484e2801bf182","amp;dn":"Snow+Patrol+-++Now+%5B2cd-mp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1d9bbc5c33862f7bdac354e428484e2801bf182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,217,187,197,195,56,98,247,189,172,53,78,66,132,132,226,128,27,241,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
