Reflecting current clinical practice, the latest advances in the diagnosis and management of neurological diseases are concisely covered.\nThe book is divided into two parts. The Neurological Approach looks at neurological history taking. The neurological examination is then discussed in detail Ã¢â‚¬â€œ consciousness, cognitive function, vision and other cranial nerves, motor function, sensation and autonomic function. In part two, Neurological Disorders, the common neurological conditions are described, along with neurological emergencies and neuro-rehabilitation. Featuring a self-assessment section, and with clinical scenario and key points boxes throughout, Lecture Notes: Neurology is ideal for medical students, junior doctors, and specialist nurses who want a concise introduction to clinical neurology that can be used as a core text or as a revision resource.
