Fisher\n\nProduct Description\nCompletely revised and updated, this Second Edition spans every issue related to ADD care and treatment.

Schwartz &quot;College Student&quot; (New York, NY) - See all my reviews\n(REAL NAME)   \nThis review is from: Attention Deficit Disorder (Hardcover)\nPersonally speaking, I can't understand why this book is not utilized by more clinicians. Being diagnosed with ADD myself, I've read a lot of the ADD literature. The only other book that compares to this one is the book by Dr. Daniel Amen which uses SPECT brain scans in order to demonstrate that their are real physical abnormalities associated with ADD and ADHD. This book by Fisher and Beckley does the same thing except from a clinical / neuropsychological perspective.\n\nIn addition, I feel that this book makes a valuable contribution that is ignored by other leading researchers such as Dr. Russell Barkley. This contribution is the distinction between the hyperactive and non-hyperactive forms of ADD. This is a widely ignored fact which is crucial in deciding what is the best course of treatment, and I can't understand why most researchers in the field ignore it. After reading this book, I only wish that more clinicians had an understanding of the different subtypes described here, and that the psychiatrists who compose the DSM-IV would pay more attention to it!\n\n\n\nBy \tLusitano Epiphany &quot;Lusitano&quot; (NY) - See all my reviews\nThis review is from: Attention Deficit Disorder (Hardcover)\nThere are three books about ADD you ought to own (four, if you're a woman.) This is most definetely one of them. Many, if not most books about ADD are helpful but the information is all the same. If you've read one &quot;all about ADD&quot; book, you're probably read them all. This one is very different and is equally helpful for ADD adults and parents/teachers of ADD kids and teens. It's worth every penny and then some.\n(The other books I found to be extremely helpful and way above-average in useful content are:\n&quot;Driven To Distraction&quot; &amp; &quot;Delivered From Distraction&quot; by Dr. John Ratey and &quot;ADD &amp; Women&quot; by Sari Solden.\nComment Comment | Permalink | Was this review helpful to you? YesNo (Report this)\n\n\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Most Comprehensive Source of Information on ADD, July 8, 2001\nBy A Customer\nThis review is from: Attention Deficit Disorder (Hardcover)\nThis book has taught me more about ADD than all the other books I have read combined. For anyone diagnosed with ADD, thinks they have ADD, or is close to someone with ADD, this book will deepen your understanding for what is really going on in the brain of an ADD individual. This book armed me with the information to understand myself better and to better inform my doctor so that he can understand me better. The authors explain the scientific reasons for ADD in its complex detail in a way that can be easily comprehended by any reader. The authors also address a subdivision of ADD that most books ignore and continue to address the vast differences that individuals within different groupings may experience. This is a great book to keep handy as a resource on ADD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e30db4c8bf9d1f839fbe78f9e60e20f5b65fb6","amp;dn":"ADHD+Attention+Deficit+Disorder+-+Practical+Coping+Mechanisms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e30db4c8bf9d1f839fbe78f9e60e20f5b65fb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,227,13,180,200,191,157,31,131,159,190,120,249,230,14,32,245,182,95,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
