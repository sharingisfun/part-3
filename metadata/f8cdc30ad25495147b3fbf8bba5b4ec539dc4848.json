Following Rick's renouncement of leadership, a council is formed consisting of Hershel, Glenn, Sasha, Daryl, and Carol, who is secretly teaching the group's children survival skills and the use of weapons. Michonne continues to hunt for The Governor. This peace is disrupted when a deadly influenza virus ravages the population, killing a number of survivors and causing a walker outbreak. The survivors then learn that someone has been feeding rats to the walkers swarming the outer fence, and shortly afterward, two sick survivors (Karen and her friend David) are found stabbed in the head and their corpses burned. The virus persists, and the infected are quarantined, including Glenn, Sasha, and a child named Lizzie Samuels. Hershel decides to care for the infected in the quarantined cell block while Daryl, Michonne, Tyreese, and former army medic Bob Stookey leave to scavenge medicine from a veterinary college. Rick soon deduces that Carol was the murderer, and after a short supply run he banishes her from the group. Quarantined survivors killed by the flu become walkers, who eventually overrun the quarantined area, while outside, hordes of walkers attracted by the rats breach the outer fence, but Hershel, Maggie, Rick and Carl manage to contain the situation until the scavenging team returns with the medicine.\n\nMeanwhile, The Governor is revealed to be alive. He and two henchmen (Martinez and Shumpert) camped out after the failed prison attack, but the two abandon him when he demonstrates signs of apathy. Finding himself alone, he burns down Woodbury and wanders aimlessly until he meets the Chambler family, consisting of sisters Lilly and Tara, their terminally ill father David, and Lilly's daughter Meghan, who reminds The Governor of his dead daughter, Penny. He adopts a false identity and commits numerous good deeds for the family in an effort to atone for his past, and the family eventually warms up to him. After David's death, the Chambler family insists upon accompanying The Governor on his journey to find a safe haven. They encounter Martinez, The Governor's sole remaining henchman, who is now leading a group of other survivors. In a private conversation, Martinez proposes sharing leadership with him, but The Governor refuses and impulsively kills him. The Governor quickly becomes leader of the new group and, when a walker nearly kills Meghan, he concludes that the prison is the only safe place for his new family.\n\nAfter leaving Lilly and Meghan at a river encampment, The Governor rallies his new army and takes Michonne and Hershel hostage. They arrive at the prison with vehicles (including a tank), and The Governor negotiates with Rick, who proposes they peacefully coexist. The Governor refuses and decapitates Hershel with Michonne's katana, provoking a firefight between the two camps. Lilly arrives carrying Meghan's corpse; the girl died after being attacked by a walker. The Governor shoots Meghan in the head and orders the tank to run down the fences, allowing walkers to overrun the area. The Governor's army is eventually annihilated, but the surviving prison inhabitants are scattered. Rick confronts and fights The Governor, who nearly kills him, but Michonne saves Rick by running The Governor through with her katana and leaves him for dead. Rick reunites with Carl, and the two search for Judith, only to find her empty and bloody infant car seat. The two then flee from the prison. Lilly finds the dying Governor and shoots him in the head.\n\nAfter the attack on the prison, the survivors leave as they are separated into several different groups. Rick and Carl scavenge supplies and they have no choice but to take shelter in a nearby home, and are later joined by Michonne; Daryl and Beth are both on their own, Tyreese has baby Judith and he is with Lizzie and Mika, and they come across Carol who rejoins the group. Maggie is with Bob and Sasha, and they set out to find Glenn because Maggie is worried about him. Glenn leaves the prison and has Tara join him to help try to find Maggie. Glenn and Tara later come across three new survivors: Sgt. Abraham Ford, Rosita Espinosa, and Dr. Eugene Porter, who are on a mission to Washington, D.C., as they say Dr. Porter knows the cause of the outbreak. Several of the survivors come upon a railroad, with a sign that says &quot;Sanctuary for all. Community for all. Those who arrive, Survive. Terminus&quot;. Daryl and Beth are separated when a funeral home they are taking shelter in is attacked by walkers, where Daryl sees a car driving off as Beth appears to have been kidnapped, leaving her bag of supplies on the ground. Daryl later joins a new group of survivors, led by a man named Joe.\n\nOn the way to Terminus, Carol, Tyreese, Lizzie, Mika, and Judith discover a farmhouse, they decide to take shelter there. Several days later, Lizzie stabs Mika to death and implores Tyreese and Carol to allow her to turn in an effort to prove that walkers are nothing but harmless people that were murdered to death. Carol thinks that Lizzie is too dangerous to be around so she decides to kill her. Later, Carol finally confesses to Tyreese that she was the one who had killed Karen. Tyreese eventually forgives her, but reminds her that he will never forget what she did, and the two leave the house with Judith to search for Terminus.\n\nEventually, Glenn and Maggie's groups reunite inside a train tunnel. Abraham insists that they go to Washington, D.C. but others insist on traveling to Terminus. Eugene and Rosita convince Abraham to seek out Terminus first as the place may have supplies, vehicles, and possibly recruits for their mission to Washington, D.C. They travel to Terminus and are met by a woman named Mary.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8cdc30ad25495147b3fbf8bba5b4ec539dc4848","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+-+Season+4+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8cdc30ad25495147b3fbf8bba5b4ec539dc4848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,205,195,10,210,84,149,20,123,63,191,139,186,91,78,197,57,220,72,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
