His main project was Bright Eyes, an eclectic group of rotating musicians that vacillated between pop, folk, electronica, and country-rock. Although Oberst remained at the center of that band, he also logged time in a number of other outfits, including Commander Venus, the Magentas, Park Ave., Desaparecidos, and an early version of the Faint. Finally, he supported like-minded artists on an executive level, co-founding Saddle Creek Records in the '90s and launching his own label, Team Love, in 2003.\r\n\r\n  A native of Omaha, Nebraska, Conor Mullen Oberst was born on February 15, 1980. He began playing guitar at the age of ten, receiving lessons from his brother Matt -- a part-time teacher who doubled as the vocalist for Sorry About Dresden -- as well as the boys' father. Conor's second sibling, Justin Oberst, joined the effort three years later by financing Conor's first release. Entitled Water, the album featured a cameo by fellow Omaha resident Ted Stevens, who also played alongside Mike Mogis in Lullaby for the Working Class. This early partnership set the stage for Oberst's collaborative discography; it also allowed Oberst to further his friendship with Mike Mogis, who would later play an integral role in Bright Eyes' success","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:709bdb37faddfe2446d0b28ac399316706599ac4","amp;dn":"Conor+Oberst+-+Ruminations+%282016%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"709bdb37faddfe2446d0b28ac399316706599ac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,155,219,55,250,221,254,36,70,208,178,138,195,153,49,103,6,89,154,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
