They are based on the traditional Amish puzzle ball, and, as such, come apart into three segments, or rings, which have to be assembled to form your animal. Gauge isn't important in these projects; however, it is important that you work as tightly as you comfortably can. Helpful tips and step-by-step photos are included in this pattern book. Each of the six designs is stitched in segments using Deborah Norville Everyday Premier yarn, is stuffed with polyfiberfill, and includes a pair of safety eyes. Animals included are Dinosaur, Elephant, Giraffe, Turtle, and two versions of Lion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e579ccc9263d6a077113344c2fa6d8aa6e617da","amp;dn":"Annie%27s+Crochet+-+Amamani+Puzzle+Balls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e579ccc9263d6a077113344c2fa6d8aa6e617da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,87,156,204,146,99,214,160,119,17,51,68,194,250,109,138,166,230,23,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
