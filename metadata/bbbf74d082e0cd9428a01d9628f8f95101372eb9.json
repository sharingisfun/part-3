I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. My name is Kvothe. You may have heard of me'\nSo begins the tale of Kvothe - now an unassuming innkeepter - from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, through his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In part one you will come to know Kvothe the notorious magician, the accomplished thief, the masterful musician, the dragon-slayer, the legend-hunter, the lover, the thief and the infamous assassin.\n\nÃ¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½Ã¢Å“Â½\nPatrick James Rothfuss (born June 6, 1973) is an American fantasy writer and college lecturer.
