While technically the songs should have been done with slack key guitars and ukuleles, the collection is a pretty fun mix of styles that haven&amp;#039;t had much to do with each other since the heydays of Blondie, the Police, and Musical Youth. Only one of these groups is represented on the soundtrack ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ UB40&amp;#039;s version of the Police&amp;#039;s &quot;Every Breath You Take,&quot; which is pleasant enough but not one of the more inspired pairings on the album. Likewise, Sugar Ray&amp;#039;s Mark McGrath just isn&amp;#039;t a strong enough vocal presence to carry off a natty dread version of the Psychedelic Furs&amp;#039; &quot;Ghost in You.&quot; However, Wyclef Jean and Eve&amp;#039;s version of the Outfield&amp;#039;s &quot;Your Love&quot; is surprisingly genuine, and while Wayne Wonder&amp;#039;s version of &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; isn&amp;#039;t as fresh as his own work, it&amp;#039;s still a decent version of the song. 311&amp;#039;s version of the Cure&amp;#039;s &quot;Love Song&quot; manages to be faithful to the original and to the concept of the soundtrack, creating a new style ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ rasta-goth? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the process. Robert Smith and company get another shoutout in the form of Dryden Mitchell&amp;#039;s &quot;Friday, I&amp;#039;m in Love,&quot; which, unfortunately, isn&amp;#039;t as successful as 311&amp;#039;s homage. Somewhat predictably, most of the standout tracks on the collection come from the artists with the most reggae credibility; Ziggy Marley&amp;#039;s version of the Cars&amp;#039; &quot;Drive&quot; imbues the song with a little more soulfulness than most of the other songs here, while Elan Atias&amp;#039; cover of Bryan Ferry&amp;#039;s &quot;Slave to Love&quot; contrasts his raspy vocals with the smooth melody. Adam Sandler&amp;#039;s closing track, &quot;Forgetful Lucy,&quot; is one of his better and more restrained songs in a while; this song, along with the rest of the soundtrack, keeps the emphasis on &quot;romantic&quot; instead of comedy. Still, 50 First Dates is a fun and funny (if gimmicky) collection of love songs.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Hold Me Now - Wayne Wonder [4:13]\n02 - Love Song - 311 [3:29]\n03 - Lips Like Sugar - Mikey Dread, Seal [5:00]\n04 - Your Love [L.O.V.E.
