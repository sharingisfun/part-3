Because, that is one thing it very much isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\nWhat Everyday Robots is, however, is a subtle, textured patchwork covering Damon AlbarnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 45 years to date, with lyrics capturing snapshots of his childhood in Leytonstone through to a song he made up for a baby elephant he met in Tanzania.\nOddly pilloried in some quarters for his sense of musical adventure, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth observing that Albarn may be the most consistently impressive songwriter of the last couple of decades, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœEveryday RobotsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is littered with evidence that his title should be safe.\n\nHaving worked with XL owner and renowned producer Richard Russell on 2012Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s wondrous Bobby Womack album Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Bravest Man In The UniverseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Albarn opted to put himself in the solo spotlight and leave his friend behind the desk.\n\nRussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature stripped-back sound is all over Ã¢â‚¬ËœEveryday RobotsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but it serves the songs well. Little touches like the piano motif from the title track (video below) reappearing at the end of album-closing Brian Eno collaboration Ã¢â‚¬ËœHeavy Seas Of LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, or the gradual hastening of the beat at the end of Ã¢â‚¬ËœLonely Press PlayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to cue in Ã¢â‚¬ËœMr. TemboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, are a delight.\n\nAlbarn appears to be railing against the technological oppression of 21st century living, whether proclaiming that Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to be a lover when the TVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s onÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Selfish GiantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (featuring Natasha Khan, aka Bat For Lashes) or exploring the idea that humans will evolve to the point where their hands only have strong scrolling thumbs.\n\nMusically, the penchant for subtle melody that he has explored so well through The Good, The Bad &amp; The Queen and some of the less chart-conquering Gorillaz material burns bright. The seven-minute sprawl of Ã¢â‚¬ËœYou And MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, another Eno collaboration, seems to be mooching along demurely before dropping down to a steel drum from which it rebuilds, sounding like the fuzzy early hours of a summerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s morning and topped with a fragile falsetto that provides the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highpoint.\n\nThe phrase Ã¢â‚¬Ëœslow-burnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is tossed around rather carelessly, but Ã¢â‚¬ËœEveryday RobotsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a definite contender. Weeks on from the first listen, it feels like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been there. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t burn out so much as creep up and these songs offer yet another new guise for a remarkable talent.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eb0b9c39219de3cc2b18c0d4ac2936b86c7ca58","amp;dn":"Damon+Albarn+-+Everyday+Robots+%282014%29+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eb0b9c39219de3cc2b18c0d4ac2936b86c7ca58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,176,185,195,146,25,222,60,194,177,140,13,74,194,147,107,134,199,202,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
