Things make a dramatic turn, when he fails to keep a promise to turn up at his son's birthday party: the neglected son (brilliantly played by Justin Cooper as Max Reede) makes a wish for his father not to lie for just one day. The boy's wish is granted and his dad loses his ability to lie, a tragic affliction for any lawyer. He cannot lie in court as well as to all those around him, like his secretary and mother.\n\n  Starring: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Jennifer Tilly, Anne Haney.\n\n  Directed by: Tom Shadyac.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 23min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bba66e7944852c824f92a08bf31503cc0985d3f5","amp;dn":"Liar+Liar+%281997%29+%28Jim+Carrey%2C+Maura+Tierney%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bba66e7944852c824f92a08bf31503cc0985d3f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,166,110,121,68,133,44,130,79,146,160,139,243,21,3,204,9,133,211,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
