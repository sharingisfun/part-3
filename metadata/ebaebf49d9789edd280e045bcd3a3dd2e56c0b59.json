Condemned to death after trying to steal the emperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scepter, she is given one opportunity to save herself. Though her skill as a Forger is considered an abomination by her captors, Shai will attempt to create a new soul for the emperor, who is almost dead.\n\nProbing deeply into his life, she discovers Emperor AshravanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s truest natureÃ¢â‚¬â€and the opportunity to exploit it. Her only possible ally is one who is truly loyal to the emperor, but councilor Gaotona must overcome his prejudices to understand that ShaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forgery is as much artistry as it is deception.\n\nBrimming with magic and political intrigue, this deftly woven fantasy delves into the essence of a living spirit.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - October 11th 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebaebf49d9789edd280e045bcd3a3dd2e56c0b59","amp;dn":"The+Emperor%27s+Soul+by+Brandon+Sanderson+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebaebf49d9789edd280e045bcd3a3dd2e56c0b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,174,191,73,217,120,158,221,40,14,4,91,205,58,61,210,229,108,11,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
