The book won the Edgar award and became an outstanding film.\n\nHe went on to write four more bestselling thrillers: Triple; The Key to Rebecca; The Man from St Petersburg; and Lie Down with Lions.\n\nHe also wrote On Wings of Eagles, the true story of how two employees of Ross Perot were rescued from Iran during the revolution of 1979. This book was made into a miniseries.\n\nHe then surprised readers by radically changing course with The Pillars of the Earth, a novel about building a cathedral in the Middle Ages. Published in September 1989 to rave reviews, it was on the New York Times bestseller list for eighteen weeks. It also reached the No. 1 position on lists in Canada, Great Britain and Italy, and was on the German bestseller list for six years.\nGenre: Historical Fiction\n\n\nBook #1 - Fall of Giants This is an epic of love, hatred, war and revolution. This is a huge novel that follows five families through the world-shaking dramas of the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the struggle for votes for women. It is 1911. The Coronation Day of King George V. The Williams, a Welsh coal-mining family, is linked by romance and enmity to the Fitzherberts, aristocratic coal-mine owners. Lady Maud Fitzherbert falls in love with Walter von Ulrich, a spy at the German Embassy in London. Their destiny is entangled with that of an ambitious young aide to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and to two orphaned Russian brothers, whose plans to emigrate to America fall foul of war, conscription and revolution. In a plot of unfolding drama and intriguing complexity, &quot;Fall Of Gaints&quot; moves seamlessly from Washington to St Petersburg, from the dirt and danger of a coal mine to the glittering chandeliers of a palace, from the corridors of power to the bedrooms of the mighty.\n\nBook #2 - Winter of the World Berlin in 1933 is in upheaval. Eleven-year-old Carla von Ulrich struggles to understand the tensions disrupting her family as Hitler strengthens his grip on Germany. Into this turmoil steps her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formidable friend and former British MP, Ethel Leckwith, and her student son, Lloyd, who soon learns for himself the brutal reality of Nazism. He also encounters a group of Germans resolved to oppose Hitler - but are they willing to go so far as to betray their country? Such people are closely watched by Volodya, a Russian with a bright future in Red Army Intelligence.\n\nThe international clash of military power and personal beliefs that ensues will sweep over them all as it rages from Cable Street in LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s East End to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, from Spain to Stalingrad, from Dresden to Hiroshima.\n\nAt Cambridge Lloyd is irresistibly drawn to dazzling American socialite Daisy Peshkov, who represents everything his left-wing family despise. But Daisy is more interested in aristocratic Boy Fitzherbert - amateur pilot, party lover and leading light of the British Union of Fascists.\n\nBack in Berlin, Carla worships golden boy Werner from afar. But nothing will work out the way they expect as their lives and the hopes of the world are smashed by the greatest and cruellest war in the history of the human race.\nWinter of the World is the second novel in Ken FollettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uniquely ambitious and deeply satisfying trilogy 'The Century'. On its own or read in sequence with Fall of Giants, this is a magnificent, spellbinding epic of global conflict and personal drama.\n\nBook #3 Edge of Eternity EDGE OF ETERNITY is the sweeping, passionate conclusion to Ken FollettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary historical epic, The Century Trilogy.\n\nThroughout these books, Follett has followed the fortunes of five intertwined families Ã¢â‚¬â€œ American, German, Russian, English, and Welsh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as they make their way through the twentieth century. Now they come to one of the most tumultuous eras of all: the enormous social, political, and economic turmoil of the 1960s through the 1980s, from civil rights, assassinations, mass political movements and Vietnam to the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, presidential impeachment, revolution Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and rock and roll.\n\nEast German teacher Rebecca Hoffman discovers sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been spied on by the Stasi for years and commits an impulsive act that will affect her family for the rest of their lives.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦George Jakes, the child of a mixed-race couple, bypasses a corporate law career to join Robert F. KennedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Justice Department, and finds himself in the middle not only of the seminal events of the civil rights battle, but a much more personal battle of his own.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Cameron Dewar, the grandson of a senator, jumps at the chance to do some official and unofficial espionage for a cause he believes in, only to discover that the world is a much more dangerous place than heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d imagined.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Dimka Dvorkin, a young aide to Nikita Khrushchev, becomes a prime agent both for good and for ill as the United States and the Soviet Union race to the brink of nuclear war, while his twin sister, Tania, carves out a role that will take her from Moscow to Cuba to Prague to Warsaw Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and into history.\n\nAs always with Follett, the historical background is brilliantly researched and rendered, the action fast-moving, the characters rich in nuance and emotion. With the hand of a master, he brings us into a world we thought we knew but now will never seem the same again.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38bbd58cf024ae296a9f0eab97b16e1973b6d335","amp;dn":"Ken+Follett+-+Century+Trilogy%28Books+1%2C+2+%26amp%3B+3%29+Epub%2C+Mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38bbd58cf024ae296a9f0eab97b16e1973b6d335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,187,213,140,240,36,174,41,106,159,14,171,151,177,110,25,115,182,211,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
