Here, Rav Laitman reveals authentic Kabbalah in a manner that is both rational and mature. Readers are gradually led to an understanding of the logical design of the Universe and the life whose home it is. The Science of Kabbalah, a revolutionary work that is unmatched in its clarity, depth, and appeal to the intellect, will enable readers to approach the more technical works of Baal HaSulam (Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag), such as Talmud Eser Sefirot and Zohar. Although scientists and philosophers will delight in its illumination, laymen will also enjoy the satisfying answers to the riddles of life that only authentic Kabbalah provides. Now, travel through the pages and prepare for an astonishing journey into the 'Upper Worlds'.\n\nIntroduction to the Book of Zohar - Volume 2\nRav Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam) Commentary by Rav Michael Laitman PhD\n\nIntroduction to the Zohar is the second in a series written by Kabbalist and scientist Rav Michael Laitman, which will prepare readers to understand the hidden message of &quot;The Zohar&quot;. Among the many helpful topics dealt with in this companion text to The Science of Kabbalah, readers are introduced to the 'language of root and branch', without which the stories in the Zohar are mere fable and legend. Introduction to the Zohar will certainly furnish readers with the necessary tools to understand authentic Kabbalah as it was originally meant to be, as a means to attain the 'Upper Worlds'.\n\nThe Zohar: annotations to the Ashlag Commentary\nRav Michael Laitman PhD\n\nThe Book of Zohar (The Book of Radiance) is an ageless source of wisdom and the basis for all Kabbalistic literature. Since its appearance nearly 2,000 years ago, it has been the primary, and often only, source used by Kabbalists.For centuries, Kabbalah was hidden from the public, which was considered not yet ready to receive it. However, our generation has been designated by Kabbalists as the first generation that is ready to grasp the concepts in The Zohar. Now, we can put these principles into practice in our lives.\n\nWritten in a unique and metaphorical language, The Zohar: annotations to the Ashlag Commentary enriches our understanding of reality and expands our worldview. However, this text should not be read in an ordinary fashion. We should patiently and repeatedly read and think about each sentence as we try to penetrate the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feelings. We should read it slowly and try to extract the nuances of the text.\nAlthough the text deals with one subject onlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½how to relate to the CreatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it approaches it from different angles. This allows each of us to find the particular phrase or word that will carry us into the depths of this profound and timeless wisdom.\n\nHebrew To English Kabbalah Dictionary (pdf)\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a17e16e6f2d7d4e2e9d52999d579bea855a5a0b","amp;dn":"The+Zohar+-+Authentic+Wisdom+of+Kabbalah+-+Bnei+Baruch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a17e16e6f2d7d4e2e9d52999d579bea855a5a0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,23,225,110,111,45,125,78,46,157,82,153,157,87,155,234,133,90,90,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
