You can search for and preview particular songs then copy them to iTunes with the touch of a button or with drag and drop. Looking to transfer more than just a few tracks? With one click, iExplorer lets you instantly rebuild entire playlists or use the Auto Transfer feature and copy everything from your device to iTunes.\n\n\n\n## Export iPhone Text Messages\n\nCall them what you want, in the last few years we've seen texting (SMSs, iMessages, text messages, etc.) rocket in popularity. These messages are replacing phone calls, voicemails and even emails. We understand that your SMSs and iMessages can be priceless to you and that's why we've spent so much time developing the best tool to help you view, export and archive your messages and attachments. The iExplorer SMS client looks great and even works with group messages, images, and other message attachments too!\n\n\n## Mount iPhone &amp; iPad to Mac's Finder &amp; Windows Explorer\n\niExplorer's disk mounting features allow you to use your iPhone, iPod or iPad like a USB flash drive. You can view your iPhone's photos directly in Finder or Windows Explorer like you would from any other digital camera. You're also able to get file system access to data contained within the apps or other directories on your device.\n\nWant to back up or move your games' high scores from one device to another? How about saving files directly to or from your favorite file manager such as iExplorer's iOS App iExplorer Mobile? iExplorer can do all of that and more.\n\n\n\n## Access Photos, Files &amp; Everything Else\n\nWith iExplorer, you can access more files and folders without modifying (jailbreaking) your device than ever before. Need to access photos on your iPhone or iPod? Can do. Want to access the files and folders of your device's apps? Done. How about browsing through your iTunes backups? Check. What about the media folders containing your iTunes purchases? We've got that too. What about files in apps that are synced to iCloud? Yes, even that.*\n\niExplorer also works great if your iPhone is Jailbroken. With AFC2 access, the app can read and write to the iOS device's real root (For advanced users only!). \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0536694c46986a25581cb397986916897e732dce","amp;dn":"iExplorer+-+3.2.3.5+With+%5BKeygen%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0536694c46986a25581cb397986916897e732dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,54,105,76,70,152,106,37,88,28,179,151,152,105,22,137,126,115,45,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
