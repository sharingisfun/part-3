What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations. The Soul of a New Machine is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the twentieth century.\n\nPlease seed and enjoy the book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1469a19ca2c732e3ccd50a02718298bae8aa4b80","amp;dn":"The+Soul+of+a+New+Machine+-+Tracy+Kidder+%28EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1469a19ca2c732e3ccd50a02718298bae8aa4b80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,105,161,156,162,199,50,227,204,213,10,2,113,130,152,186,232,170,75,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
