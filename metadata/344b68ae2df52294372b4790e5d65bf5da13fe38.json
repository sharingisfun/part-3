To date, no graphical version of IDA for Linux has has been leaked, prompting me to get my own copy. The evaluation version is a little buggy and we don't get that nifty decompiler, but most of the functionally was restored making for a fairly competent disassembler/debugger.\n\n-Completely replaced the code that loads the loader modules, removing the PE/ELF/Mach-O limitation.\n-Removed the check restricting which processor modules are allowed.\n-Created a custum loader to re-enable support for loading Binary files.\n-Removed the experation check.\n-Removed the nags when opening and closing projects.\n-Disabled the thread that would open a nag after some time. In the past it would force the program to close, but I guess that was broken in the transition to QT.\n-Removed the checks preventing self-disassembly.\n-Removed a limitation preventing large large amounts of data from being copied to the clipboard.\n-Some options were removed from the Help menu for cosmetics.\n\nNo database saving or loading, you have to save your work like this:\nFile-&gt;Produce File-&gt;Dump Database to IDC file...\nTo load it, reload the file your working on, then open your saved IDC to restore your session:\nFile-&gt;Script file...\nThis will work between different versions of IDA so you can use your old databases and move between versions at will.\n\n\nPics:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaAJFaagE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaAJFaagE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAajdAage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAajdAage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/paaJfAAGE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/paaJfAAGE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAajBAaGE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pAajBAaGE&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOld:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8150831/Hex-Rays_IDA_6.3_Linux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8150831/Hex-Rays_IDA_6.3_Linux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8170135/Hex-Rays_IDA_6.3_Linux_REPACK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8170135/Hex-Rays_IDA_6.3_Linux_REPACK&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNotes:\n\n-This is based on the demo version, so no x64 disassembly.\n-Numerous features are still disabled (databases, batch mode, produce ASM, etc) as I don't really use them and it would be quite an effort to stitch them back in.\n-Those looking for something similar to the Hex-Rays Decompiler can look into SmartDec. They can provide a linux build on request.\n-If you want a full pro version, IDA Pro 5.7 was leaked by APTguy as part of OPERATION &quot;JIuCTOnAD&quot; (DEFOLIATION). Still no GUI for linux users yet :(\n\n\nThis release was built with:\n\nIDA Demo 6.5 Linux (core)\nIDA Pro 5.7 Linux (loaders, plugins, procs)\nIDA Pro 6.5 Windows (idc, ids, sig, til)\nIDA SDK 6.5 (updates)\nIDAPython 1.6.0 (added goodie)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:344b68ae2df52294372b4790e5d65bf5da13fe38","amp;dn":"Hex-Rays+IDA+6.5+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"344b68ae2df52294372b4790e5d65bf5da13fe38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,75,104,174,45,245,34,148,55,43,71,144,229,214,91,245,218,19,254,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
