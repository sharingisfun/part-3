It goes beyond simply detecting and removing viruses on your PC by blocking infected links as you browse, checking files before they're downloaded, and helping protect your personal data online and on your PC with enhanced privacy features. With 2016, we've improved our core engine and its accuracy, and included a new cloud-based detection method. And because we know that security is just as important as usability, AntiVirus Free 2016 features a revamped, easier-to-use design.\r\n\r\nWe've been hard at work optimizing our core engine to increase its detection accuracy. That includes better detection of screen-locker ransomware and improved scanning of all downloadable files to keep you safe from an exponentially expanding pool of threats.\r\n\r\nAnd when a new online threat breaks out and spreads, the key to keeping you protected is the speed with which we can react. Our new Outbreak Detection gives us the tools to act immediately and curtail their spread. With AntiVirus Free 2015, you don't have to wait until the next virus-definition package is ready to be protected: the moment we know a threat's there, you're covered.\r\n\r\nFinally, we believe security should be clean and simple to be effective, and we've put a lot of work in making sure AntiVirus Free 2015 is intuitive to use. Our new simplified design makes sure you know what needs your attention at a glance. Combined with our free comprehensive online support, you can be sure you're getting our best protection.\r\n\r\nThe main parts of the program are the antivirus scanner and the resident shield, which monitors files opened, saved and copied from various sources, the quarantine module, used for storing infected data, plus an e-mail scanner (compatible with popular email clients, like Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird) that checks incoming messages for attachments with viruses and spam.\r\n\r\nMoreover, AVG AntiVirus Free Edition provides the user with an additional anti-rootkit scanner, which makes it possible to remove dangerous rootkit components (undetected during the standard scan), which hide their presence in popular applications, drivers or DLL files and enable unauthorized access to the computer. What is more, the program also offers two more components, that should be especially useful for the Internet users â€“ Identity Protection used for protecting the system from new and yet unidentified threats and LinkScanner, which protects the users from attacks during searching for something on the web and browsing web pages. The latter also uses Search-Shield function, which scans links generated by the most popular search engines (Google, Yahoo etc.), as well as Surf-Shield, that detects sites with exploits and other dangerous pages before the user visits them.\r\n\r\nNew in version 2016 Build 7497 (March 15, 2016)\r\nâ€¢ Fixed bugs.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nâ€¢ processor: 1.5 GHhz or faster\r\nâ€¢ memory: 512 MB of RAM\r\nâ€¢ screen resolution: at least 1024x768 pixels\r\nâ€¢ disk space needed for installation: 1500 MB\r\nâ€¢ browser: Internet Explorer 6 or higher\r\n\r\nOS: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10 (32/64-bit)\r\n\r\nLanguages: English, French, German, Hungarian, Spanish, Italian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Indonesian, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Turkish [/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScan result of keygen of embrace:-\r\n \nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/752eb7398f844711ca188bb314e02f973326d3a3ebe8c7fa9e15b77b8a40a788/analysis/\r\nDetection ratio: \t45 / 57","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ddc401f0b30cf24ebc7735202c8c42e62c5cea5","amp;dn":"AVG+Antivirus%2Binternet+Security+2016+V.16.51+Build+7497+Final+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ddc401f0b30cf24ebc7735202c8c42e62c5cea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,220,64,31,11,48,207,36,235,199,115,82,2,200,196,46,98,197,206,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
