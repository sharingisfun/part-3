The atmosphere of dread and paranoia grows increasingly intense as the complexity of the alien invasion is gradually revealed, until nobody can be trusted to be who they appear.\n\n  Starring: Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy, Veronica Cartwright, Don Siegel.\n\n  Directed by: Philip Kaufman.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 55min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 704 x 416\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22f085f2454d444392face4b322ff472cee728ce","amp;dn":"Invasion+of+the+Body+Snatchers+%281978%29+%28Donald+Sutherland%2C+Brooke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22f085f2454d444392face4b322ff472cee728ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,240,133,242,69,77,68,67,146,250,206,75,50,47,244,114,206,231,40,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
