Perelman\nMIR Publishers, Moscow | 1988 | ISBN-10: 5030000259 | English | PDF | 376 pages | 12 mb\n\nIn 1913, in Russian bookshops, appeared a book by the outstanding educationist Yakov Isidorovich Perelman entitled Physics for Entertainment. It struck the fancy of the young who found in it the answers to many of the questions that interested them. Physics for Entertainment not only had an interesting layout, it was also immensely instructive.\nIn the preface to the 11th Russian edition Perelman wrote: &quot;The main objective of Physics for Entertainment is to arouse the activity of scientific imagination, to teach the reader to think in the spirit of the science of physics and to create in his mind a wide variety of associations of physical knowledge with the widely differing facts of life, with all that he normally comes in contact with.&quot; Physics for Entertainment was a best seller.\n\nAbout the Author\nYa. I. Perelman was born in 1882 in the town of Byelostok (now in Poland). In 1909 he obtained a diploma of forester from the St. Petersburg Forestry Institute. After the success of Physics for Entertainment Perelman set out to produce other books, in which he showed himself to be an imaginative popularizer of science. Especially popular were :\n\n* Arithmetic for Entertainment \n* Mechanics for Entertainment \n* Geometry for Entertainment\n* Astronomy for Entertainment \n* Lively Mathematics\n* Physics Everywhere \n* Tricks and Amusements\n \nToday these books are known to every educated person in the Soviet Union. He has also written several books on interplanetary travel {Interplanetary Jour-neys, On a Rocket to Stars, World Expanses, etc.). The great scientist K. E. Tsiolkovsky thought highly of the talent and creative genius of Perelman. He wrote of him in the preface to Interplanetary Journeys: &quot;The author has long been known by his popular, witty and quite scientific works on physics, astronomy and mathematics, which are moreover written in a marvelous language and are very readable.&quot;\nPerelman has also authored a number of textbooks and articles in Soviet popular science magazines.\nIn addition to his educational, scientific and literary activities, he has also devoted much time to editing. So he was the editor of the magazines Nature and People and In the Workshop of Nature. Perelman died on March 16, 1942, in Leningrad. Many generations of readers have enjoyed Perelman's fascinating books, and they will undoubtedly be of interest for generations to come.\n\nCONTENTS\nBy the Way 33\nFor Young Physicists 53\nA Sheet of Newspaper 86\nSeventy-Five More Questions and Experiments on Physics 100\nOptical Illusions 143\nBrain-Twisting Arrangements and Permutations 164\nSkilful Cutting and Connecting 178\nProblems with Squares 184\nProblems on Manual Work 188\nProblems on Purchases and Prices 193\nWeight and Weighing 199\nProblems on Clocks and Watches 205\nProblems on Transport 211\nSurprising Calculations 215\nPredicaments 221\nProblems from Gulliver's Travels 229\nStories about Giant Numbers 237\nTricks with Numbers 250\nMerry Arithmetic 273\nCount 285\nFast Reckoning 289\nMagic Squares 296\nArithmetic Games and Tricks 303\nWith a Stroke of the Pen 332\nGeometric Recreations 338\nWithout a Tape-Measure 354\nSimple Tricks and Diversions 358\nDrawing Puzzles 366\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:272914eff5765e4976827027398db2b454a40311","amp;dn":"Fun+with+Maths+and+Physics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"272914eff5765e4976827027398db2b454a40311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,41,20,239,245,118,94,73,118,130,112,39,57,141,178,180,84,164,3,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
