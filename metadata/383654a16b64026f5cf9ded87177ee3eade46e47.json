After graduation she became a journalist, and worked briefly as a dramatist. However, her first success as a novelist, Report for Murder: The First Lindsay Gordon Mystery, did not appear until 1987.\r\n\r\nMcDermid was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Sunderland in 2011.\r\n\r\nMcDermid's notable characters are a lesbian journalist, Lindsay Gordon; a private investigator, Kate Brannigan; and a psychologist, Tony Hill, who suffers from sexual dysfunction. \r\n\r\nHer books mainly fall into three series: Lindsay Gordon, Kate Brannigan, and, beginning in 1995, the Tony Hill and Carol Jordan series, the first entry in which, The Mermaids Singing, won the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger for Best Crime Novel of the Year.\r\n\r\nThe Hill/Jordan series has been adapted for television under the name Wire in the Blood, starring Robson Green. Val McDermid has stated that Vance, a TV celebrity with a secret lust for torture, murder and under-age girls who featured in The Wire in the Blood and two later books, is based on her direct personal experience of interviewing Jimmy Savile. \r\n\r\nMcDermid considers her work to be part of the &quot;Tartan Noir&quot; Scottish crime fiction genre. As well as her novels, McDermid contributes to several British newspapers and often broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Scotland.\r\n\r\nHer novels, in particular the Tony Hill series, are known for their graphic depictions of violence and torture.\r\n\r\nStandalone Novels\r\n(2000) Killing the Shadows- better version thanks to amosattaboy\r\n(2006) Cleanskin\r\n(2006) The Grave Tattoo \r\n(2008) A Darker Domain \r\n(2011) Trick of the Dark\r\n\r\nLindsay Gordon series\r\n1.
