This    \n  week's technical challenge is Paul's favourite sweet treat - iced     \n  fingers. Finally, for the showstopper, the bakers have to make a      \n  labour-intensive and technically demanding layered or laminated       \n  pastry dough to produce a batch of three different types of pastries  \n  or croissants.                                                        \n                                                                        \n  With a place in the final within their grasp, the bakers know they    \n  have to deliver their very best to the judging table every time.      \n                                                                        \n  Enjoy!                                                                \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a0d794c6c3d2c5d7e0c7cdc1c9cc8ec3cfcd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:752419d650d1ab38daac0f2e4757a6de8cdf7b6d","amp;dn":"The.Great.British.Bake.Off.S02E07.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"752419d650d1ab38daac0f2e4757a6de8cdf7b6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,36,25,214,80,209,171,56,218,172,15,46,71,87,166,222,140,223,123,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
