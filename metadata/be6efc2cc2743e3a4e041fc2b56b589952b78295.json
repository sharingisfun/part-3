If you're new to do-it-yourself computing, begin with the basics of electronic components and circuits in Chapter 1. Then tour the Arduino Uno unit and the IDE, as author Peggy Fisher demonstrates how to connect your computer with the Arduino and walks through loading and executing your first program. Learn about triggering LED lights and controlling actions with push buttons. Then put your knowledge to work in several sample projects, including a digital hourglass, a program that translates text into Morse code, and a light-driven music instrumentÃ¢â‚¬â€the theremin. Finally, find out how to extend the capabilities of the Arduino with attachable shields, or boards.\nTopics include:\n\n    Exploring basic electronics concepts\n    What is the Arduino?\n    Understanding power flow\n    Using a solderless breadboard\n    Buying an Arduino\n    Installing drivers\n    Verifying and updating sketches\n    Adjusting an LED's brightness\n    Using a button to change a circuit's state\n    Sending input from the serial console to the Arduino\n    Adding functionality with breakout boards\n    Troubleshooting techniques\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6efc2cc2743e3a4e041fc2b56b589952b78295","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Up+and+Running+with+Arduino","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6efc2cc2743e3a4e041fc2b56b589952b78295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,110,252,44,194,116,62,58,78,4,31,194,181,107,88,153,82,183,130,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
