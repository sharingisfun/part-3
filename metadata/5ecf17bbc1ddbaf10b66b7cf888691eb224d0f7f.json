And things only got harder from there.\r\n\r\nSnatched out of special operations and thrown headfirst into a secretive new unit, Lincoln finds himself as the team leader for the 519th Applied Intelligence Group, better known as the Outriders. And his first day on the job brings a mission with the highest possible stakes.\r\n\r\nA dangerously cunning woman who most assuredly should be dead has seemingly returned. And her plans arenâ€™t just devastating, they might be unstoppable.\r\n\r\nHow do you defeat a hidden enemy when you canâ€™t let them know theyâ€™ve been discovered?\r\n\r\nYou send in the Outriders.\r\n\r\nRead by James Lindgren\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ecf17bbc1ddbaf10b66b7cf888691eb224d0f7f","amp;dn":"Jay+Posey+-+Outriders+%28Outriders+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ecf17bbc1ddbaf10b66b7cf888691eb224d0f7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,207,23,187,193,221,186,241,11,102,183,207,136,134,145,235,34,77,15,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
