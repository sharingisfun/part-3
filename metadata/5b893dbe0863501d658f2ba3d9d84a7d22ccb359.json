King\n20th Century Masters\nThe Millennium Collection\nThe Best Of B.B.King (1999)\n\nUniversally hailed as the reigning king of the blues, the legendary B.B. King is without a doubt the single most important electric guitarist of the last half century. His bent notes and staccato picking style have influenced legions of contemporary bluesmen, while his gritty and confident voice -- capable of wringing every nuance from any lyric -- provides a worthy match for his passionate playing. Between 1951 and 1985, King notched an impressive 74 entries on Billboard's R&amp;B charts, and he was one of the few full-fledged blues artists to score a major pop hit when his 1970 smash &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; crossed over to mainstream success (engendering memorable appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and American Bandstand). Since that time, he has partnered with such musicians as Eric Clapton and U2 while managing his own acclaimed solo career, all the while maintaining his immediately recognizable style on the electric guitar. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tBlues\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.The Thrill Is Gone\n02.Ain't Nobody Home\n03.Let The Good Times Roll\n04.Guess Who\n05.I Like To Live The Love\n06.Don't Answer The Door\n07.Sweet Sixteen\n08.Paying The Cost To Be The Boss\n09.I Got Some Help I Don't Need\n10.Into The Night\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b893dbe0863501d658f2ba3d9d84a7d22ccb359","amp;dn":"B.B.+King+-+The+Best+Of+B.B.King+%281999%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b893dbe0863501d658f2ba3d9d84a7d22ccb359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,137,61,190,8,99,80,29,101,143,43,163,217,216,74,125,34,204,179,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
