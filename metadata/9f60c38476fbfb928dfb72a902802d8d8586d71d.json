Surface science provides major support to many technologically ambitious industries. It also makes significant contributions to product development and problem solving in many materials-based industries where surface finish, cleanliness, adhesion, wear or friction are important. An understanding of surface processes is vital in chemical industries because of the importance of heterogeneous catalysis and is likely to make major contributions to the growing optoelectronics and molecular sensing industries. In social terms, an improved understanding of surfaces will facilitate the development of better catalysts and sensors for improvement of our environment. This series brings together key contributions to the study of solid surfaces and their interactions with foreign species. The aim is to provide an in-depth introduction to the world of surface and interfacial science and is most suited for scientists with a background in the natural sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f60c38476fbfb928dfb72a902802d8d8586d71d","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Surface+Science+%5BUpdated+at+2016.10.05%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f60c38476fbfb928dfb72a902802d8d8586d71d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,96,195,132,118,251,251,146,141,251,114,169,2,128,45,141,133,134,215,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
