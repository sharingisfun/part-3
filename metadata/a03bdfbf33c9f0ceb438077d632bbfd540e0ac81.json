As if 1989's Decade weren't stellar enough, this select package was much more solid. Greatest showcased the band's early days of glam rock dÃ©cor and new romanticism to the alluring sophistication Duran Duran exuded throughout the '90s. \r\nThe typical synth-powered pop hits are included -- &quot;Girls on Film,&quot; &quot;Rio,&quot; &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; -- as well as the signature ballads -- &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; -- but it might also receive criticism due to its chronological disarray. Still, that gives no reason to fret, for other goodies can be found throughout. The much-neglected &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; is featured, as well as the band's mature eclecticism of such songs from the self-titled Wedding Album -- &quot;Ordinary World&quot; and &quot;Come Undone.&quot; \r\nThe band's experimentation with new millennium electronica found on &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot; again refocuses on Simon LeBon as the center of the band. A continuity blatantly obvious on Greatest and the strong commercialism that progressed throughout the band's healthy evolvement is not denied. \r\nThose chart-smashing singles from the 1980s made them a force to be reckoned with and an arena favorite. The songs are nearly ageless and they get their due here. It's a cheeky production and a definitive depiction of one of rock's biggest pop bands.
