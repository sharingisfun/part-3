Raw and spectral, heartbroken, yet jubilant, these ten songs tell the story of a very hard year in the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and all the love that helped her through it.\n\nWhereas the singer's past two LPs, including 2008's Polaris-nominated Oh, My Darling, were made in Montreal's all-analogue Hotel 2 Stango studio, Tall Tall Shadow is a more modern thing. This is a record with echo and reverb, electronic flutters and electric autoharp, voices that charge and incandesce around buzzing guitars, lonely piano and rattling percussion.\n\nTo get to this place, Bulat co-produced the album with, Tim Kingsbury and Mark Lawson. Kingsbury, a member of Arcade Fire, &quot;can play anything and everything,&quot; she says. Lawson, who has worked on records with Akron/Family and Colin Stetson, and who won a Grammy for his work on Arcade Fire's The Suburbs, is a studio alchemist, someone who &quot;hears things&quot; hidden in songs, who is always keen to transform them.\n\nThey started recording in Toronto, at a reverberating 60-year-old dance hall. Once again, Bulat put together a band: her brother, the punk-inclined drummer Bobby Bulat; Holly Coish on keys and backing vocals; Kingsbury and Ben Whiteley on guitars and bass. One song features Whiteley's father, the folk legend Ken Whiteley, on gospel organ. But Tall Tall Shadow isn't acoustic folk music: like Beck's Sea Change or Buckingham Nicks, chord and strum are a launch-pad for wilder sounds.\n\nBulat's goal was to keep challenging herself. &quot;Promise Not to Think About Love,&quot; with shimmying bass and dancing handclaps, is the poppiest track she has ever released. &quot;It Can't Be You,&quot; played on an Andean charango, is one of the simplest. &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; is all crescendo, a woman in a storm, and the title track reaches soaring for the sky: has there ever been a better showcase for Bulat's powerhouse voice? For her steam-train heart?\n\n&quot;Two months before I was due to begin recording, I suffered a deep loss,&quot; Bulat says. &quot;I kind of started over.&quot; She started; and she didn't stop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d77b0d0734da829aa808b6d12d011acce7432a6","amp;dn":"Basia+Bulat+-+Tall+Tall+Shadow+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d77b0d0734da829aa808b6d12d011acce7432a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,119,176,208,115,77,168,41,170,128,139,109,18,208,17,172,206,116,50,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
