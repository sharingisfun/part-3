The single &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; stayed at #1 in the UK for five weeks straight and became a #1 hit in many countries. The album debuted at #1 in the UK, selling 5.7 million copies worldwide since its release and counting. The album cover of Life in Cartoon Motion has since been used in an iPod Touch commercial. It was the fifth best-selling album in the world in 2007.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By James Berry - The pop world might be all cooing 'n' cross-eyed over this flamboyant elfin with extended tail-feathers, as if it were shaken suddenly from a slumber, but the arrival of such a character was in fact always inevitable. He's an unlikely but traceable amalgamation of random pop culture explosions from the past few years--two parts Paulo Nutini, one part Kemal from Big Brother, a dash of Daphne &amp; Celeste, a barrel measure of Scissor Sisters, and another pinch of post-ironic dancing to Elton John at the Students' Union gone midnight. It's no secret that the UK has a weakness for pretty-boy singer songwriters either--he fits in there too, in that he's about to stick its index finger in the socket and pour it a drink.  Give it 12 months and you might be taking out a restraining order--Mika will split opinion--but his quasi-soul falsetto is unbelievable, that much is immediately obvious. There are moments nearing syrupy Feeling-esque normalcy (take &quot;My Interpretation&quot;), but those aside itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s high camp insatiability all the way. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a hint of Freddie MercuryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s theatricality in the voice, and in &quot;Big Girl&quot; he's even written a modern day &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;. &quot;Lollipop&quot; is Jake Shears leading the Jackson 5, &quot;Love Today&quot; is the missing link between the Bee Gees and Village People and &quot;Relax, Take It Easy&quot; is a chilled Pet Shop Boys in gold lamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. Too cheesy to be a classic, perhaps, but this is just the brand of subversive eccentricity Robbie has failed miserably to achieve over his past few albums.\n\nTrack Listings \n\n[01] Grace Kelly\n[02] Lollipop\n[03] My Interpretation\n[04] Love Today\n[05] Relax, Take It Easy\n[06] Any Other World\n[07] Billy Brown\n[08] Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\n[09] Stuck In The Middle\n[10] Happy Ending - Over My Shoulder\n[11] Ring Ring\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:47m:08s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 124mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 05 February 2007\nRecord Company\t&gt; Island Records Group Universal Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.mikasounds.com\n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_%28singer%29\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/m/mika.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/mika\n&gt;\n&gt;[Grace Kelly]\n&gt;[Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12d3aabeaabd9caaddddafd1f73d0f0b86096537","amp;dn":"%5B2007%5D+Life+In+Cartoon+Motion+-+Mika+124mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12d3aabeaabd9caaddddafd1f73d0f0b86096537","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,211,170,190,170,189,156,170,221,221,175,209,247,61,15,11,134,9,101,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
