It was recorded in October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London and released on Atlantic Records on 12 January 1969 in the United States and 31 March in the United Kingdom. Featuring integral contributions from each of the group's four musicians, the album established their fusion of blues and rock. It also attracted a large and devoted following to the band; Zeppelin's take on the emerging heavy metal sound endeared them to parts of the counterculture on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nAlthough the album first received negative reviews, it was commercially very successful, and critics have come to view it in a much more positive light. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 29 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time (it kept its rank when Rolling Stone updated the list in 2012).In 2004, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n2014 reissue\n\nAlong with the group's two next albumsÃ¢â‚¬â€Led Zeppelin II and Led Zeppelin IIIÃ¢â‚¬â€the album was remastered and reissued on 3 June 2014. The reissue comes in 6 formats: a standard CD edition, a deluxe 2 CD edition, a standard LP version, a deluxe 3 LP version, a super deluxe 2 CD+3 LP version with a hardback book, and as high-resolution, 96k/24-bit digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material from a concert in Paris recorded in October 1969.\n\n\nTrack Listing - 2014 Remaster [320k MP3]\n\n\n1. \t&quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot;   2:46\n2. \t&quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot;   \t \t6:42\n3. \t&quot;You Shook Me&quot;   \tWillie Dixon, J.
