Using this simple tool youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to tune even the most complex SQL, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn to do it quickly, without the huge learning curve usually associated with tuning as a whole.\n\nFirmly based in real world problems, this book helps you reclaim system resources and avoid the most common bottleneck in overall performance, badly tuned SQL.  YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how the optimizer works, how to take advantage of its latest features, and when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better to turn them off.\n\n- Quickly tune any SQL statement no matter how complex.\n- Build and tune test cases without affecting production.\n- Use the latest tuning features with confidence.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- How and why complex SQL goes wrong\n- When statistics are crucial and when they are not\n- How and when the tuning facilities of the database can help or hinder\n- When to tune and when not to tune\n- Which steps in an execution plan are crucial to performance\n- How the optimizer works out the execution plan\n\nWho this book is for\nOracle SQL Tuning with SQLTXPLAIN is ideal for everyone who deals with SQL and SQL tuning.  Both developers and DBAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s will benefit from learning how to use the SQLTXPLAIN tool along with the problem solving approach described in this book.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
