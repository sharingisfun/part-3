To critics who carped that her choice of hues was not &quot;realistic&quot;, she responded that she was choosing the hues that were best suited psychologically to her story. The film's protagonist is a young, married carpenter (Jean-Claude Drouot). He takes a mistress (Marie-France Boyer), assuming that he can be equally in love with both his wife and the new woman in his life. When the wife drowns, the mistress quietly takes her place. This plot twist is remains a subject of debate amongst Varda's admirers.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Le Bonheur.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 704 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 20mn\n      Bit rate : 1220 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 9.68 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 20mn\n      Bit rate : 1086 Kbps\n      Width : 608 pixels\n      Height : 352 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.210\n      StreamSize : 622 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 20mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 72.2 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nCriterion Collection rip\n\nIMDB: tt0058985\n\nFrench audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles (.srt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:720b9c443b1b5bc58e965f04a29a24f262d93954","amp;dn":"Le+Bonheur+-+Happiness+-+Varda+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"720b9c443b1b5bc58e965f04a29a24f262d93954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,11,156,68,59,27,91,197,142,150,95,4,162,154,36,242,98,217,57,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
