To bring the subject to life, the theory is applied to the all important field of atomic physics. Great flexibility is achieved through the use of a flow diagram and starred sections which make it possible to omit topics and vary the order in which they are studied. Illuminating problems and hints for their solution are provided.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:815528c7d26610440c05c0175e55018a0f0e0c2d","amp;dn":"Quantum+Mechanics-+Franz+Mandl%2C+Wiley+2013E+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"815528c7d26610440c05c0175e55018a0f0e0c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,85,40,199,210,102,16,68,12,5,192,23,94,85,1,138,15,14,12,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
