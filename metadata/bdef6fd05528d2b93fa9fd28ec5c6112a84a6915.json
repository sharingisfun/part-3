The Infamous\n\nAlbum Review\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the New York hardcore movement, The Infamous is Mobb Deep's masterpiece, a relentlessly bleak song cycle that's been hailed by hardcore rap fans as one of the most realistic gangsta albums ever recorded. Given Mobb Deep's youthful age and art-school background, it's highly unlikely that The Infamous is drawn strictly from real-life experience, yet it's utterly convincing, because it has all the foreboding atmosphere and thematic sweep of an epic crime drama. That's partly because of the cinematic vision behind the duo's detailed narratives, but it's also a tribute to how well the raw, grimy production evokes the world that Mobb Deep is depicting. The group produced the vast majority of the album itself, with help on a few tracks from the Abstract (better known as Q-Tip), and establishes a spare, throbbing, no-frills style indebted to the Wu-Tang Clan. This is hard, underground hip-hop that demands to be met on its own terms, with few melodic hooks to draw the listener in. Similarly, there's little pleasure or relief offered in the picture of the streets Mobb Deep paints here: They inhabit a war zone where crime and paranoia hang constantly in the air. Gangs are bound together by a code of fierce loyalty, relying wholly on one another for survival in a hopeless environment. Hostile forces Ã¢â‚¬â€ cops, rivals, neighborhood snitches Ã¢â‚¬â€ are potentially everywhere, and one slip around the wrong person can mean prison or death. There's hardly any mention of women, and the violence is grim, serious business, never hedonistic. Pretty much everything on the album contributes to this picture, but standouts among the consistency include &quot;Survival of the Fittest,&quot; &quot;Eye for a Eye,&quot; &quot;Temperature's Rising,&quot; &quot;Cradle to the Grave,&quot; and the classic &quot;Shook Ones, Pt. 2.&quot; The product of an uncommon artistic vision, The Infamous stands as an all-time gangsta/hardcore classic.\n\nBiography\n\nFormed: 1992 in Queens, New York, NY\nGenre: Hip-Hop/Rap\nYears Active: '90s, '00s, '10s\n\nAs golden age rap suddenly gave way to West Coast gangsta in the early '90s, an East Coast variety of hardcore rap arose in turn, with Mobb Deep initially standing tall as one of New York's hardcore figureheads on the basis of their epochal album The Infamous. Released in April 1995, The Infamous was released almost exactly a year after Illmatic and about a half year after Ready to Die Ã¢â‚¬â€ the debut masterpieces of Nas and the Notorious B.I.G., respectively, both albums likewise of momentous...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdef6fd05528d2b93fa9fd28ec5c6112a84a6915","amp;dn":"Mobb+Deep+-+The+Infamous+-+iTunes+Deluxe+Version+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdef6fd05528d2b93fa9fd28ec5c6112a84a6915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,239,111,208,85,40,210,185,63,169,253,40,236,92,97,18,168,74,105,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
