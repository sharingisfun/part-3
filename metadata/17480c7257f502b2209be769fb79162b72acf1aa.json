Claire Randall, a former combat nurse, is back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon--when she walks through a standing stone in one of the ancient stone circles that dot the British Isles. Suddenly she is a Sassenach--an &quot;outlander&quot;--in a Scotland torn by war and raiding Highland clans in the year of Our Lord...1743.\n\nHurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire is catapulted into intrigues and dangers that may threaten her life...and shatter her heart. For here she meets James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, and becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire...and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17480c7257f502b2209be769fb79162b72acf1aa","amp;dn":"Outlander+%28Outlander%2C+%231%29+-+Diana+Gabaldon.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17480c7257f502b2209be769fb79162b72acf1aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,72,12,114,87,245,2,178,32,155,231,105,251,121,22,43,114,172,241,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
