He followed it with a second novel, Wonder Boys (1995), and two short-story collections. In 2000, Chabon published The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, a critically acclaimed novel that John Leonard, in a 2007 review of a later novel, called Chabon's magnum opus. It received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001.\n\nHis novel The Yiddish Policemen's Union, an alternate history mystery novel, was published in 2007 to enthusiastic reviews and won the Hugo, Sidewise, Nebula and Ignotus awards; his serialized novel Gentlemen of the Road appeared in book form in the fall of that same year. Chabon's most recent novel, Telegraph Avenue, published in 2012 and billed as &quot;a twenty-first century Middlemarch&quot;, concerns the tangled lives of two families in the Bay Area of San Francisco in the year 2004.\n\nHis work is characterized by complex language, the frequent use of metaphor along with recurring themes, including nostalgia, divorce, abandonment, fatherhood, and most notably issues of Jewish identity. He often includes gay, bisexual, and Jewish characters in his work. Since the late 1990s, Chabon has written in an increasingly diverse series of styles for varied outlets; he is a notable defender of the merits of genre fiction and plot-driven fiction, and, along with novels, he has published screenplays, children's books, comics, and newspaper serials.\n\n\nThe torrent contains:\n\nAs Contributor or Editor\n\n* McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales (2003) -- Mobi\n\n\nEssay Collections\n\n* Maps and Legends (2008) -- ePUB\n\n* Manhood for Amateurs (October 2009) -- ePUB\n\n\nNovels\n\nThe Mysteries of Pittsburgh (1988) -- Mobi\n\nWonder Boys (1995) -- ePUB\n\nThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay (2000) -- Mobi\n\nThe Final Solution (2004) -- ePUB\n\nThe Yiddish Policemen's Union (2007) -- ePUB\n\nGentlemen of the Road (2007) -- ePUB\n\nTelegraph Avenue (2012) -- Mobi\n\n\nShort Story Collections\n\n* A Model World and Other Stories (1991) -- ePUB\n\n* Werewolves in Their Youth (1999) -- ePUB\n\n\nRead the articles, interview, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give feedback!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chabon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chabon&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/books/by-the-book-michael-chabon.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/books/by-the-book-michael-chabon.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/09/10/michael_chabon_interview_why_the_telegraph_avenue_author_still_loves_prog_rock_.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/09/10/michael_chabon_interview_why_the_telegraph_avenue_author_still_loves_prog_rock_.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2012/09/09/160553028/michael-chabon-journeys-back-to-telegraph-avenue&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2012/09/09/160553028/michael-chabon-journeys-back-to-telegraph-avenue&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://michaelchabon.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://michaelchabon.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01c4e2333301728908470b3edceee96121376df","amp;dn":"Michael+Chabon+-+Novels%2C+Essays+and+Short+Stories+%2812+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01c4e2333301728908470b3edceee96121376df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,28,78,35,51,48,23,40,144,132,112,179,237,206,238,150,18,19,118,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
