Joyland is a brand-new novel and has never previously been published.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nEditorial Reviews\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon.com Review\nAn Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2013: What a smart, sweet, spooky, sexy gem of a story. In this one-off for the Hard Case Crime publishing imprint, King has found yet another outlet and format (print only, a280 pages) to suit his considerable talents. All are on full display here in the story of Devon Jones--&quot;a twenty-one-year-old virgin with literary aspirations Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and a broken heart&quot;--who spends the summer of 1973 at Joyland amusement park in North Carolina. Devon makes new pals, proves himself to the hard-core carny workers, saves a girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, befriends a dying boy (who has a secret gift), and falls for the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protective, beautiful mother. The first half of the story is sweet and nostalgic, with modest hints of menace to come. (Think: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Body,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novella that became the film Stand By Me.) Devon learns to Ã¢â‚¬Å“sell funÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“wear the furÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (carny-speak for dressing as Howie the Happy Hound, the park mascot), but he also learns about the woman who had been killed in the Funhouse, whose ghost still haunts Joyland. King has fun with the carny lingo--most of it researched and real, some of it invented. (The Ferris wheel, for example, is the chump-hoister.) The second half gets spookier, spinning into a full-on murder mystery--but also a love story, and a coming-of-age-story, with some supernatural fun woven in. More than a trifecta, this is King at his narrative and nostalgic best. A single-session tale to savor some summer afternoon. And then try not to keep thinking back on it. --Neal Thompson --This text refers to the Paperback edition.\nReview\n&quot;This oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a must for King fans and may also attract YA readers.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Library Journal\n\n&quot;...period murder mystery with a heart...King brings his usual finesse to this taleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mystery elements&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;...the book...features some of King's most graceful writing...ruminative, amused, digressive, marvelously unaffected, and finally, devastatingly sad.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Entertainment Weekly \n\n&quot;An amusement park and murder figure into a coming-of-age tale in this miniature thriller with a hint of the supernatural.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Los Angeles Times\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“UndeniableÃ¢â‚¬Â¦charm [and] aching nostalgiaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦[JOYLAND] reads like a heartfelt memoir and might be KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gentlest book, a canny channeling of the inner peace one can find within outer tumult.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Booklist\n\n&quot;Wrapped in a gloriously pulpy cover, Joyland is a coming-of-age story set in 1973 at a North Carolina amusement park -- creepy! -- that's haunted by a murderer.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Time Magazine\n\n&quot;Stephen King's carny-saturated Joyland evokes the ghosts of summers past -- literally.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ New York Magazine\n\nFor the most part there are no chapter markers on the discs, and thus the tracklist below don't list chapters either.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e7ff1804fc6f596a2d4b64e27d6345068cba4f","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+Joyland+%5BUnabridged%5D+%5BAudible+Audio+Edition%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e7ff1804fc6f596a2d4b64e27d6345068cba4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,231,255,24,4,252,111,89,106,45,75,100,226,125,99,69,6,140,186,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
