Rattlesnake is a hard-edged opener that starts the album off with a bang, while Ghost provides some beautiful textures and female vocals that come as a great change of pace. Really, virtually every song on here is a winner, but they are also songs that won&amp;#039;t immediately grab you like TC&amp;#039;s did -- ya&amp;#039; gotta give this album time to find a way to your soul","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:237792e1c23b4c17338dae5b85f3ed2aeee5e730","amp;dn":"Live+-+Secret+Samadhi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"237792e1c23b4c17338dae5b85f3ed2aeee5e730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,119,146,225,194,59,76,23,51,141,174,91,133,243,237,42,238,229,231,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
