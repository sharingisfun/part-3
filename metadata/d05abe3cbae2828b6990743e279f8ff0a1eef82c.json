Between 1861 and 1865, thousands of British citizens volunteered for service on both sides of the Civil War. From the first cannon blasts on Fort Sumter to Leeâ€™s surrender at Appomattox, they served as officers and infantrymen, sailors and nurses, blockade runners and spies. Through personal letters, diaries, and journals, Foreman introduces characters both humble and grand, while crafting a panoramic yet intimate view of the war on the front lines, in the prison camps, and in the great cities of both the Union and the Confederacy. In the drawing rooms of London and the offices of Washington, on muddy fields and aboard packed ships, Foreman reveals the decisions made, the beliefs held and contested, and the personal triumphs and sacrifices that ultimately led to the reunification of America.\r\n\r\nNAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY\r\nThe Washington Post â€¢ The New Yorker â€¢ Chicago Tribune â€¢ The Economist â€¢ Nancy Pearl, NPR â€¢ Bloomberg.com â€¢ Library Journal â€¢ Publishers Weekly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d05abe3cbae2828b6990743e279f8ff0a1eef82c","amp;dn":"A+World+on+Fire%3A+Britain%27s+Crucial+Role+in+the+U.S.+Civil+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d05abe3cbae2828b6990743e279f8ff0a1eef82c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,90,190,60,186,226,130,139,105,144,116,62,39,159,143,240,161,238,248,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
