King, Vince Gill, Steve Winwood, and of course Clapton himself in an 11-hour show that included some of the greatest guitar players around.\n\nThe event was recorded on DVD and the sound here is remarkable. What really comes across is the extraordinary range of guitar tones that were heard during this performance. Ranging from the crystal clarity of Derek Trucks' sweet slide on Midnight in Harlem and the stinging ringing of Buddy Guy's Strat on Five Long Years to Jeff Beck's pulverizing wah riffs on Hammerhead and Stevie Winwood's classic Fender lines on Dear Mr. Fantasy, every note and every lick resonated clearly in the ears of the 27,000 fans in attendance.\n\nZZ Top burned the house down with vintage electric blues on Waiting For the Bus and Jesus Just Left Chicago. Strangely, Clapton's own tones on songs like Crossroads and his duet with Winwood on Blind Faith's Had to Cry Today came across as a bit thin and brittle. Maybe we're just used to the original blinding and furious sounds he conjured on the originals.\n\n Lyrics: Most of the guitar players present at the Crossroads Show were also singers and their vocal sets were equally as inspired as their guitar workouts. Susan Tedeschi on Coming Home was soulfully poignant and her voice soared. Stevie Winwood's adolescent tenor was still present on classics like Had to Cry Today, Dear Mr. Fantasy and Hendrix's Voodoo Chile. B.B. King conveyed a sense of majestic calm on his signature song The Thrill is Gone, an ensemble piece that included Clapton, Robert Cray and Jimmie Vaughan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8221942491fec547ce46431673c7aab230b816e","amp;dn":"Crossroads+Guitar+Festival+2010+%5BChromecast%5D+720p+x264+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8221942491fec547ce46431673c7aab230b816e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,34,25,66,73,31,236,84,124,228,100,49,103,60,122,171,35,11,129,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
