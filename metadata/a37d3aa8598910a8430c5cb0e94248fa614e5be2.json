In the words of its creators, it &quot;started as an attempt to make pornography... [but] degenerated into sex comedy pretty much immediately.&quot;  Most of the episodes (called &quot;stories&quot;) are single non-sequential pages, though some stretch out longer; the very first one was eight pages long.  The comic started out as a gag-a-week work, but slowly started including longer story arcs, which appear to be (very) slowly coming together into a single overarching plot.\n\nThis torrent includes &quot;Oglaf&quot; comic strips from its beginning in 2006 through the end of 2014 in a collection of CBR files, one for each year.  Each strip's page includes its title and both its regular and its &quot;hidden&quot; mouseover text comments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a37d3aa8598910a8430c5cb0e94248fa614e5be2","amp;dn":"Oglaf+%28NSFW+Web+Comic%29+-+Complete+through+2014+%7BWebComixFan%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a37d3aa8598910a8430c5cb0e94248fa614e5be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,125,58,168,89,137,16,168,67,12,92,176,233,66,72,250,97,78,91,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
