During their 2005 tour of duty in Iraq, Lima Company â€“ a unit of Marines, all from Ohio â€“ lost 23 men on the front lines. Combat Diary combines footage shot by the Marines themselves with home digital cameras and interviews with many of the surviving soldiers and parents and wives of men who died. The soldier's footage ranges from bored hijinks to actual firefights, including a troubling, surreal scene of men in full gear, with rifles ready, patrolling through a crowded Iraqi bazaar.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 704x400, 25.000 fps, 1150 Kbps, 01h29m56s\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/joux6pz0/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bbe8109e1212f8ccc5316ee3b949284dba269c8","amp;dn":"Combat+Diary%3A+The+Marines+of+Lima+Company+%5B2006+-+USA%5D+docu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bbe8109e1212f8ccc5316ee3b949284dba269c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,190,129,9,225,33,47,140,204,83,22,238,59,148,146,132,219,162,105,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
