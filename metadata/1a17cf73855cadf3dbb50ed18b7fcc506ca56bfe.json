This valuable research Handbook provides a thorough and contemporary tableau of current thinking in copyright law. It traces the changes undergone and the challenges faced by copyright, as well as its roots and its diversity, combining to present a colorful picture of a dynamic research area.\nThe editor brings together an elite group of international copyright scholars who offer incisive and original analysis of a wide range of issues and aspects of copyright law, and in some cases a multiplicity of perspectives on a single topic. Rigorous and often thought-provoking in nature, this research Handbook clearly maps the current landscape, and will also undoubtedly stimulate further research in the field.\nAnalyzing the cutting edge of current copyright research, Copyright Law will be of great interest to researchers, students, practitioners and policymakers.\n\n===================================================================================\nContributors: J.
