Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Eddie Vedder (vocals), Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), and Mike McCready (guitar). The band's current drummer is Matt Cameron, also of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was criticized early on as being a corporate cash-in on the alternative rock explosion. However, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having &quot;spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.&quot;[1]\n\n\n\nEnjoy Pearl Jam :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5def7e228502a0f32dce1971ab7a19b218c086f4","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+Discography+1991+-+2011+%5B+FLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5def7e228502a0f32dce1971ab7a19b218c086f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,239,126,34,133,2,160,243,45,206,25,113,171,122,25,178,24,192,134,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
