Or so I thought until one night I heard laughter coming through an apparent hole in my bedroom wall.\r\n\r\nDamien had been listening to all of my phone sessions with my therapist.\r\n\r\nThe sexy artist next door now knew all of my deepest secrets and insecurities.\r\n\r\nWe got to talking.\r\n\r\nHe set me straight with tips to get over my breakup.\r\n\r\nHe became a good friend, but Damien made it clear that he couldnÃ¢Â€â„¢t be anything more.\r\n\r\nProblem was, I was falling hard for him anyway. And as much as he pushed me away, I knew he felt the sameâ€¦because his heartbeat didnÃ¢Â€â„¢t lie.\r\n\r\nI thought my heart had been broken by Elec, but it was alive and beating harder than ever for Damien.\r\n\r\nI just hoped he wouldnÃ¢Â€â„¢t shatter it for good.\r\n\r\nAuthor's note â€“ Neighbor Dearest is a full-length standalone novel.
