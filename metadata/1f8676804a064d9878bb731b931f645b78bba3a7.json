He worked as a magazine editor and publisher before starting to write fiction. So far he has written four Department Q thrillers, which all hit the Danish bestseller lists on publication and stayed there ever since.\n\nDepartment Q:\nThe Keeper of Lost Causes (#1): Carl MÃƒÂ¸rck used to be one of CopenhagenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best homicide detectives. Then a hail of bullets destroyed the lives of two fellow cops, and CarlÃ¢â‚¬â€who didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t draw his weaponÃ¢â‚¬â€blames himself. So a promotion is the last thing he expects. But Department Q is a department of one, and CarlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got only a stack of CopenhagenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coldest cases for company. His colleagues snicker, but Carl may have the last laugh, because one file keeps nagging at him: a liberal politician vanished five years earlier and is presumed dead. But she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dead Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ yet. \n\nThe Absent One (#2): In The Keeper of Lost Causes, Jussi Adler-Olsen introduced Detective Carl MÃƒÂ¸rck, a deeply flawed, brilliant detective newly assigned to run Department Q, the home of CopenhagenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coldest cases. The result wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what MÃƒÂ¸rckÃ¢â‚¬â€or readersÃ¢â‚¬â€expected, but by the opening of Adler-OlsenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shocking, fast-paced follow-up, MÃƒÂ¸rck is satisfied with the notion of picking up long-cold leads. So heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s naturally intrigued when a closed case lands on his desk: A brother and sister were brutally murdered two decades earlier, and one of the suspectsÃ¢â‚¬â€part of a group of privileged boarding-school studentsÃ¢â‚¬â€confessed and was convicted. \n\nBut once MÃƒÂ¸rck reopens the files, it becomes clear that all is not what it seems. Looking into the supposedly solved case leads him to Kimmie, a woman living on the streets, stealing to survive. Kimmie has mastered evading the police, but now they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only ones looking for her. Because Kimmie has secrets that certain influential individuals would kill to keep buried . . . as well as one of her own that could turn everything on its head. \n\nA Conspiracy of Faith (#3): Detective Carl MÃƒÂ¸rck holds in his hands a bottle that contains old and decayed message, written in blood. It is a cry for help from two young brothers, tied and bound in a boathouse by the sea. Could it be real? Who are these boys, and why werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they reported missing? Could they possibly still be alive?\n\nCarlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation will force him to cross paths with a woman stuck in a desperate marriage- her husband refuses to tell her where he goes, what he does, how long he will be away. For days on end she waits, and when he returns she must endure his wants, his moods, his threats. But enough is enough. She will find out the truth, no matter the cost to her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â€or to herself.\n\nCarl and his colleagues Assad and Rose must use all of their resources to uncover the horrifying truth in this heart-pounding Nordic thriller from the #1 international bestselling author Jussi Adler-Olsen. \n\nFull retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
