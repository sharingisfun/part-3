Nine-year-old Prince Jorg is forced to watch as his mother and brother are slaughtered. Fleeing the palace, Jorg joins a bloodthirsty band of thugs. But heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to take back whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rightfully his, so he returns to the castle a few years later - unaware of the dark and powerful magic that awaits.\n\n---\n\nKing of Thorns - King of Thorns continues the tale of antihero Jorg Ancrath. After wresting back control of his kingdom from those who murdered his family, Jorg sees the land erupt with hundreds of battles fought by lords and petty kings. More daunting still, he faces an enemy many times his own strength. Jorg may not be able to win this battle in a fair fight, but he wields a rage and cunning that just might even the odds.\n\n---\n\nEmperor of Thorns - Jorg would be emperor. It is a position not to be gained by the sword but rather by vote. And never in living memory has anyone secured a majority of the vote, leaving the Broken Empire long without a leader. Jorg has plans to change that - one way or the other. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncovered even more of the lost technology of the land, and he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate to use it. But he soon finds an adversary standing in his way, a necromancer unlike any he has ever faced - a figure hated and feared even more than himself: the Dead King. The boy who would rule all may have finally met his match....\n\n\n\nRead by James Clamp\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\nType: Unabridged\nNarrator: James Clamp\nQuality: 64 kbps / 2.0 Stereo / 44100 hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4915fedbd1b0310fab8cbe0eef6cf9f8328c875c","amp;dn":"Mark+Lawernce+-+The+Broken+Empire+%5B1-3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4915fedbd1b0310fab8cbe0eef6cf9f8328c875c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,21,254,219,209,176,49,15,171,140,190,14,239,108,249,248,50,140,135,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
