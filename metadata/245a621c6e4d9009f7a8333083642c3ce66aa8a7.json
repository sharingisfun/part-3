Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fearÃ¢â‚¬â€of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.\n\nAs civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. He is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors. But for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odysseyÃ¢â‚¬â€spanning miles and decadesÃ¢â‚¬â€towards the time and place where she must finish what should never have begun.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:245a621c6e4d9009f7a8333083642c3ce66aa8a7","amp;dn":"The+Passage+by+Justin+Cronin+%28The+Passage+Book+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"245a621c6e4d9009f7a8333083642c3ce66aa8a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,90,98,28,110,77,144,9,247,168,51,48,131,100,44,60,230,106,168,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
