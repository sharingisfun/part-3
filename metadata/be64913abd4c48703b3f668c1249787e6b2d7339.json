This concise introductory paperback surveys and relates basic physics to living systems, encompassing solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, sound, electricity, optics, and atomic and nuclear physics. The new edition has been updated with a discussion of atomic force microscopy, use of lasers in medical diagnostics and the applications of nanotechnology in biology and medicine.\n\nApplied health workers, even with little formal background in physics, will learn how biological systems can be analyzed quantitatively, how physical and engineering analysis techniques have helped advance the life sciences, and also the limits of quantitative analysis as applied to living systems. End-of-chapter exercises and extensive reference sections add to the book's value in academic and clinical settings.\n\n-    Provides practical techniques for applying knowledge of physics to the study of living systems\n-    Presents material in a straight forward manner requiring very little background in physics or biology\n-    Includes many figures, examples and illustrative problems and appendices which provide convenient access to the most important concepts of mechanics, electricity, and optics in the body\n-    An Instructor Solutions Manual is available at textbooks.elsevier.com\n-    Updated to include current research topics, including nanoscience, basal metabolism, laser imaging, and atomic force microscopy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be64913abd4c48703b3f668c1249787e6b2d7339","amp;dn":"Physics+in+Biology+and+Medicine+%284th+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be64913abd4c48703b3f668c1249787e6b2d7339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,100,145,58,189,76,72,112,59,63,102,140,18,73,120,126,107,45,115,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
