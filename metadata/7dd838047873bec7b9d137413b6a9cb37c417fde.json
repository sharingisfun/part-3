May I suggest Stan Rogers? His music was\nbeautifully representative of Canadian folk traditions, and his original\ncompositions always sounded like authentic, old songs. [I agree with Divya -\nI have only heard a few of Rogers&amp;#039; songs, but this was the aspect that most\nstruck me. His songs do indeed sound traditional; a hard trick to pull off,\nbut Rogers does it beautifully. - m.] Two of my favourites are &quot;Northwest\nPassage&quot; and &quot;Barrett&amp;#039;s Privateers&quot;. I first heard the former on the last\nepisode of the TV series &amp;#039;Due South&amp;#039;; it was an incredible a capella version\nthat has to be heard to be truly appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dd838047873bec7b9d137413b6a9cb37c417fde","amp;dn":"Stan+Rogers+-+Northwest+Passage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dd838047873bec7b9d137413b6a9cb37c417fde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,216,56,4,120,115,190,199,185,209,55,65,59,106,156,179,124,65,127,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
