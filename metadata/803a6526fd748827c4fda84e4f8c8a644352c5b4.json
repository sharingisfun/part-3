Arriving four years after Some Cities, the album is brimming with atmosphere and tension, while the quality of thesongwriting here is what sets Doves apart from the majorityof British guitar bands. From the energetic delivery of opener Jetstream to the moving, dark sound of its title track/lead single, Kingdom Of Rust is sure to please long time fans while opening up plenty more doors for the group along the way.\nKingdom of Rust primarily features production work from Dan Austin (Massive Attack), with two additional tracks helmed by industry vet John Leckie (XTC, Stone Roses, Radiohead's The Bends).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:803a6526fd748827c4fda84e4f8c8a644352c5b4","amp;dn":"Doves+-+Kingdom+Of+Rust+%5Bmp3-320-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"803a6526fd748827c4fda84e4f8c8a644352c5b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,58,101,38,253,116,136,39,196,253,168,78,79,140,138,100,67,82,197,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
