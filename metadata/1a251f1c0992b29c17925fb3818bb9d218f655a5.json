This book introduces R using SAS and SPSS terms with which you are already familiar. It demonstrates which of the add-on packages are most like SAS and SPSS and compares them to RÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s built-in functions. It steps through over 30 programs written in all three packages, comparing and contrasting the packagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ differing approaches. The programs and practice datasets are available for download.\n\nThe glossary defines over 50 R terms using SAS/SPSS jargon and again using R jargon. The table of contents and the index allow you to find equivalent R functions by looking up both SAS statements and SPSS commands. When finished, you will be able to import data, manage and transform it, create publication quality graphics, and perform basic statistical analyses.\n\n&quot;This is a really great book. It is easy to read, quite comprehensive, and would be extremely valuable to both regular R users and users of SAS and SPSS who wish to switch to or learn about RÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦An invaluable reference.&quot; - David Hitchcock, University of South Carolina\n\n&quot;Thanks for writing R for SAS and SPSS Users--it is a comprehensible and clever document. The graphics chapter is superb!&quot; - Tony N. Brown, Vanderbilt University\n\n&quot;This is a Rosetta Stone for SPSS and SAS users to start learning R quickly and effectively.&quot; - Ralph O'Brien, ASA Fellow\n\n&quot;I am a professional SAS and SPSS programmer and found this book extremely useful.&quot; - Tony Chu, Public Policy Research Data Analyst\n\nSource: http://www.amazon.com/SAS-SPSS-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387094172\n\nFormat: PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a251f1c0992b29c17925fb3818bb9d218f655a5","amp;dn":"R+for+SAS+and+SPSS+Users+%28Statistics+and+Computing%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a251f1c0992b29c17925fb3818bb9d218f655a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,37,31,28,9,146,178,156,23,146,95,179,129,139,185,210,24,246,85,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
