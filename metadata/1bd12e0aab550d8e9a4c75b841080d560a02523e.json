Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up has included drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Since 1995, Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries. The band emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and later became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their second album, Ãƒâ€ nima, in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album, 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and commercial success around the world. Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship and the band's insistence on privacy.\n\n\nTool - 10,000 Days (flac) [MentalZero][Eccles] (Size: 447.26 MB)\n \t\t00 Tool album art 01.JPG\t65.13 KB\n \t\t00 Tool album art 02.JPG\t66.5 KB\n \t\t01 Vicarious.flac\t48.75 MB\n \t\t02 Jambi.flac\t49.32 MB\n \t\t03 Wings for Marie (Pt. 1).flac\t31 MB\n \t\t04 10,000 Days (Wings, Pt. 2).flac\t68.6 MB\n \t\t05 The Pot.flac\t42.38 MB\n \t\t06 Lipan Conjuring.flac\t4.98 MB\n \t\t07 Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann).flac\t20.21 MB\n \t\t08 Rosetta Stoned.flac\t75.16 MB\n \t\t09 Intension.flac\t37.55 MB\n \t\t10 Right in Two.flac\t51.57 MB\n \t\t10,000 Days.cue\t1.78 KB\n \t\t11 Viginti Tres.flac\t17.61 MB\n \t\tTool - 10,000 Days.m3u\t663 bytes\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t2.42 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t749 bytes\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 447 MiB\nAlbum                                    : 10,000 Days\nTrack name/Total                         : 11\nComposer                                 : Tool\nGenre                                    : Alternative metal/Art rock\nRecorded date                            : April 28, 2006\n\n\n===========================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 958 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd12e0aab550d8e9a4c75b841080d560a02523e","amp;dn":"Tool+-+10%2C000+Days+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D%5BEccles%5D+%28Size%3A+447.26+MB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd12e0aab550d8e9a4c75b841080d560a02523e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,209,46,10,171,85,13,142,154,76,117,184,65,8,13,86,10,2,82,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
