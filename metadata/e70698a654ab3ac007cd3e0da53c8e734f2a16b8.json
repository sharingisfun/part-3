Basil is impressed by Dorian's beauty and becomes infatuated with him, believing his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil's, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry's world view. Espousing a new hedonism, Lord Henry suggests the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfillment of the senses. Realizing that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian (whimsically) expresses a desire to sell his soul to ensure the portrait Basil has painted would age rather than he. Dorian's wish is fulfilled, plunging him into debauched acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, with each sin displayed as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of aging.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e70698a654ab3ac007cd3e0da53c8e734f2a16b8","amp;dn":"The+Picture+of+Dorian+Gray+by+Oscar+Wilde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e70698a654ab3ac007cd3e0da53c8e734f2a16b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,6,152,166,84,171,58,192,7,205,62,13,165,60,142,115,79,42,22,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
