The series was broadcast on the ITV network in the UK, and starred Jeremy Brett as the famous detective, a portrayal that many consider to be the definitive screen version of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn addition, Holmes's faithful friend and companion Dr. Watson is scrupulously portrayed as the kind of thoroughly competent sidekick Holmes would want, was played in the two Adventures series by David Burke, before he elected to leave the series to be able to spend more time with his wife and young son. He was replaced by Edward Hardwicke, who played Watson for the remainder of the run.\n\n\n\nSherlock Holmes - S05E01 - The Disappearance Of Lady Frances Carfax.avi (349.32 megabyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E01 - The Disappearance Of Lady Frances Carfax.srt (57.47 kilobyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E02 - The Problem Of Thor Bridge.avi (347.8 megabyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E02 - The Problem Of Thor Bridge.srt (62 kilobyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E03 - Shoscombe Old Place.avi (344.1 megabyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E03 - Shoscombe Old Place.srt (55.21 kilobyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E04 - The Boscombe Valley Mystery.avi (351.89 megabyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E04 - The Boscombe Valley Mystery.srt (65.69 kilobyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E05 - The Illustrious Client.avi (348.92 megabyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E05 - The Illustrious Client.srt (57.84 kilobyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E06 - The Creeping Man.avi (348.14 megabyte)\nSherlock Holmes - S05E06 - The Creeping Man.srt (56.9 kilobyte)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d1b3071bde9b64150a79f62fac9436da8747442","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Sherlock+Holmes+Jeremy+Brett+Season+5-BOZX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d1b3071bde9b64150a79f62fac9436da8747442","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,27,48,113,189,233,182,65,80,167,159,98,250,201,67,109,168,116,116,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
