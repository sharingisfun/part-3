Eerie aspects of the incident â€” unsettling and unexplained causes of death, a strange final photograph taken by one of the hikers, and signs of radioactivity â€” have led to decades of speculation over what really happened.\r\n\r\nThis New York Times bestseller is a gripping work of literary nonfiction delves into the mystery through unprecedented access to the hikers' own journals and photographs, government case files, dozens of interviews, and the author's retracing of the hikers' fateful journey in the Russian winter. A fascinating portrait of the young hikers and a skillful interweaving of their story and the author's investigations, here for the first time is the real story of what happened that night on Dead Mountain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef4ea5b43ea8d273a8b978466a07acc890e283a","amp;dn":"Dead+Mountain%3A+The+Story+of+the+Dyatlov+Pass+Incident","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef4ea5b43ea8d273a8b978466a07acc890e283a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,244,234,91,67,234,141,39,58,139,151,132,102,160,122,204,137,14,40,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
