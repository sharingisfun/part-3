Using insightful stories to bring his message to life, he shows us how to heal our emotional wounds, recover the freedom and joy that are our birthright, and restore the spirit of playfulness that is vital to loving relationships. Using teachings from the three Toltec Masteries (Awareness, Transformation, and Love) as a foundation, don Miguel brings to light the fallacies and misplaced expectations about love that permeate most relationships. He gracefully shares his wisdom through delightful and engaging stories that clarify each point and bring his message to life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c1c1c9cfd21e8787ec3d60d8e0f920479f2a700","amp;dn":"The+Mastery+of+Love+Don+Miguel+Ruiz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c1c1c9cfd21e8787ec3d60d8e0f920479f2a700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,28,28,156,253,33,232,120,126,195,214,13,142,15,146,4,121,242,167,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
