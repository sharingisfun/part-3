Hardware versions introduce new virtual hardware\nfunctionality and new features while enabling VMware to run legacy operating\nsystems in our virtual machines. New features included in this hardware\nversion:\n\n*16 vCPUs\nVirtual machines can now run with up to 16 virtual CPUs. This enables very\nprocessor intensive applications to be run in a virtual machine.\nNote: Running virtual machines with 16 vCPUs requires that both your host\nand guest operating system support 16 logical processors. Your physical\nmachine must have at least 8 cores with hyper-threading enabled to power\non a virtual machine with this configuration.\n\n*8 Terabyte Disks \nVirtual machines can now include virtual disks greater than 2 Terabytes.\nGiven the limitations of most operating systems to boot from disks greater\nthan 2 Terabytes, These large disks are most useful as secondary drives for\nfile storage.\n\nNote: To use a disk greater than 2TB for a boot disk, your guest operating\nsystem would need to boot using EFI in order to read a GPT formatted disk\nwhich is required to access all of the sectors on a disk of this size.\nAdditionally, the Buslogic controller is not capable of supporting a disk\ngreater than 2TB.\n\nExtra murphy78 note: To enable EFI boot mode, edit the .VMX file and add:\nfirmware = &quot;efi&quot;\nAlternatively, to set it back to bios (legacy) boot, change to:\nfirmware = &quot;bios&quot;\n\nTested, working on Win10TP build 9860.\n\nEnjoy,\nmurph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc8d9a45df59f7de5d80eb578a009d68e09322e3","amp;dn":"VMware+Workstation+10.0.4+Build+2249910+-+ZWT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc8d9a45df59f7de5d80eb578a009d68e09322e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,141,154,69,223,89,247,222,93,128,235,87,138,0,157,104,224,147,34,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
