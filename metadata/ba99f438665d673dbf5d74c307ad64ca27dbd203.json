Their role is to nurture all knowledge while safeguarding it from the vagaries of the irrational saecular outside world. Among the monastic scholars is 19-year-old Raz, collected into the concent at age eight and now a decenarian, or tenner (someone allowed contact with the world beyond the stronghold walls only once a decade). But millennia-old rules are cataclysmically shattered when extraterrestrial catastrophe looms, and Raz and his teenage companionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½engaging in intense intellectual debate one moment, wrestling like rambunctious adolescents the nextÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are summoned to save the world.\n\nAnathem/Note to the Listener.mp3\nAnathem/Timeline.mp3\n\nAnathem/01 Provener/01 Anathem.mp3\nAnathem/01 Provener/02 Cloister.mp3\nAnathem/01 Provener/03 Aut.mp3\nAnathem/01 Provener/04 Saunt.mp3\nAnathem/01 Provener/05 Mystagogue.mp3\nAnathem/01 Provener/06 Kefedokhles.mp3\nAnathem/01 Provener/07 Proc.mp3\nAnathem/01 Provener/08 Incanter.mp3\n\nAnathem/02 Apert/01 Ita.mp3\nAnathem/02 Apert/02 Avout.mp3\nAnathem/02 Apert/03 Sline Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/02 Apert/04 Sline Part 2.mp3\nAnathem/02 Apert/05 Newmatter.mp3\nAnathem/02 Apert/06 Liaison.mp3\nAnathem/02 Apert/07 Plane.mp3\nAnathem/02 Apert/08 Bulshytt.mp3\n\nAnathem/03 Eliger/01 Eliger Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/03 Eliger/02 Eliger Part 2.mp3\n\nAnathem/04 Anathem/01 Gardan's Steelyard.mp3\nAnathem/04 Anathem/02 Calca.mp3\nAnathem/04 Anathem/03 To Go Hundred Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/04 Anathem/04 To Go Hundred Part 2.mp3\n\nAnathem/05 Voco/01 Lineage.mp3\nAnathem/05 Voco/02 Ringing Vale.mp3\nAnathem/05 Voco/03 Big Three.mp3\nAnathem/05 Voco/04 Eleven.mp3\nAnathem/05 Voco/05 Terrible Events.mp3\n\nAnathem/06 Peregrin/01 Peregrin.mp3\nAnathem/06 Peregrin/02 Bazian Orthodox Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/06 Peregrin/03 Bazian Orthodox Part 2.mp3\nAnathem/06 Peregrin/04 Erasmas.mp3\n\nAnathem/07 Feral/01 Reticule.mp3\nAnathem/07 Feral/02 Sea of Seas Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/07 Feral/03 Sea of Seas Part 2.mp3\nAnathem/07 Feral/04 Allswell.mp3\nAnathem/07 Feral/05 Kelx.mp3\nAnathem/07 Feral/06 Vout Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/07 Feral/07 Vout Part 2.mp3\n\nAnathem/08 Orithena/01 Semantic Faculties.mp3\nAnathem/08 Orithena/02 Metekoranes.mp3\nAnathem/08 Orithena/03 Sconic.mp3\nAnathem/08 Orithena/04 Dialog Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/08 Orithena/05 Dialog Part 2.mp3\n\nAnathem/09 Inbrase/01 Convox Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/09 Inbrase/02 Convox Part 2.mp3\nAnathem/09 Inbrase/03 Tredegarh.mp3\n\nAnathem/10 Messal/01 Lorite.mp3\nAnathem/10 Messal/02 Everything Killer.mp3\nAnathem/10 Messal/03 Sphenics.mp3\nAnathem/10 Messal/04 Rebirth.mp3\nAnathem/10 Messal/05 Syntactic Faculties Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/10 Messal/06 Syntactic Faculties Part 2.mp3\n\nAnathem/11 Advent/01 Teglon Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/11 Advent/02 Teglon Part 2.mp3\nAnathem/11 Advent/03 Rod Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/11 Advent/04 Rod Part 2.mp3\nAnathem/11 Advent/05 Causal Domain.mp3\nAnathem/11 Advent/06 Requiem.mp3\nAnathem/11 Advent/07 Harbinger.mp3\n\nAnathem/12 Requiem/01 Requiem.mp3\nAnathem/12 Requiem/02 Rhetor Part 1.mp3\nAnathem/12 Requiem/03 Rhetor Part 2.mp3\n\nAnathem/13 Reconstitution/01 Upsight.mp3\n\n\nIOLET: Music from the World of Anathem\n--------------------------------------\nBitrate: 64kbps\n\nChannels: 2 (Stereo)\n\nSample Rate: 22.050KHz\n\nThe music on this disc was composed to accompany Neal Stephenson's novel Anathem. After hearing a short verbal description of the core ideas for the book during a dinnertime conversation in 2006, I was completely drawn into the world that Neal was creating. I began to draft musical ideas to match some of the imaginary musical traditions that he had described, and Neal supplied draft copies of his book to me as it took shape. The experimental vocal music that you hear on this disc is the result.\n\nIt was clear from day one that the characters in the book possess not one, but many musical traditions, each forged over thousands of years of isolation, and each strangely similar to, yet exotically removed from, the monastic traditions of Earth. As an active performer of Earthly vocal music, as a lapsed musicologist, and especially as a composer, I was excited by the possibilities opened up by Neal's imagination: somber music to celebrate the mysteries of philosophy and mathematics within the soaring stone walls of a cloister; simple songs to ease the mathematical drudgery of verifying theories; inward meditations upon truth and beauty; and finally, fiendishly difficult musical games designed to hone intellectual prowess.\n\n-- David Stutz\n\nAnathem/IOLET/01 Approximating Pi.mp3\nAnathem/IOLET/02 Thousander Chant.mp3\nAnathem/IOLET/03 Proof Using Finite Projective Geometry.mp3\nAnathem/IOLET/04 Cellular Automata.mp3\nAnathem/IOLET/05 Quantum Spin Network.mp3\nAnathem/IOLET/06 Sixteen Color Prime Generating Automaton.mp3\nAnathem/IOLET/07 Deriving The Quadratic Equation.mp3\nAnathem/IOLET/08 Mascheroni Circles.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba99f438665d673dbf5d74c307ad64ca27dbd203","amp;dn":"Anathem+-+Neal+Stephenson+%5B2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba99f438665d673dbf5d74c307ad64ca27dbd203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,153,244,56,102,93,103,61,191,93,116,195,7,173,100,202,39,219,210,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
