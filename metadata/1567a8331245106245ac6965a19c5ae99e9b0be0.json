However, when the experiment initiates, you realize that it might not be as ordinary as you thought. Odd things begin to happen as you make your way to one of the Black Mesa test chambers. Even weirder things happen when you start to move the test sample towards the antimass-spectrometer...\n\nThis is a standalone version of Black Mesa. You do not need Steam in order to play the game.
