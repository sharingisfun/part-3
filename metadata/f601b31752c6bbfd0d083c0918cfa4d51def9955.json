Meticulously planned and planted, the herb garden contains only species of plants known to have been grown during the Middle Ages. It is a joy to visit on a warm spring or summer day. Sweet Herbs and Sundry Flowers is a readable, beautifully illustrated description of the Bonnefont Garden, a valuable resource for any herbalist or historian. It's a permanent fixture in my herbal library.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f601b31752c6bbfd0d083c0918cfa4d51def9955","amp;dn":"Sweet+Herbs+and+Sundry+Flowers+-+Medieval+Gardens+and+the+Garden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f601b31752c6bbfd0d083c0918cfa4d51def9955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,1,179,23,82,198,187,253,13,8,60,9,24,207,164,213,29,239,153,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
