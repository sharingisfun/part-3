Not\neverything can read a DVD, and USB booting is hit and miss at best.\n\nIt's been a long time. How have you been? Things have changed since we last\nmet... I got myself a corporate IT job, still doing computer repair on the\nside. But being a side thing, kinda has its pros and cons. On one hand I don't\nhave constant first-hand experience using the disc anymore. On the other hand,\nI can also take a step back and look at it from a designer's point of view...\nhow well does it work? What does it do good, what's bad, what could be done\nbetter? How can I make this the [ULTIMATE BOOT CD] it claims to be?\n\nThis disc, a minor half-version revision, is the answer to those questions.\nScoured through every option, considered the usefulness of some tools, added\nothers, collaborated with users over Facebook, gutted some functions and built\nothers. A launcher here, a script there, and about 1,500 WIM captures. I\nimagine I went through some 20 ISO re-burns, 150 virtual machine boots, 200 VHD\nmount/unmounts... I can't even count how much time has been put into polishing\nthis thing. All for the love of making computer repair accessible to anyone\nthat wants it.\n\nOf note... let's see here. Virtual Floppy enables you to mount images from your\nUSB stick to be used in a boot selection like MiniXP (for F6 SATA/RAID drivers)\nor DR-DOS (BIOS flashing). VFD with file copy allows you to make a &lt;1mb RAR file\naccessible to DR-DOS or Hiren's DOS in a virtual floppy. Wireless drivers in\nMiniXP along with improved Ethernet and storage support. Mini Linux provided by\nRIP Linux. Bootable partition and imaging utilities provided by Acronis True\nImage and EASEUS Partition Manager. Improved Memtest86+ with failsafe mode to\nresolve startup hangs. Kon-Boot 1.1 is really v1.1 now, with support for 32-bit\nand 64-bit Windows. Tons of new utilities in MiniXP with new launchers to\nprovide easier access. ERD 5.0 is integrated with MiniXP for offline system\nrestore and service/driver management, and Microsoft DaRT 6.5 (x86 and x64) are\nadded to support Windows Vista and 7. Antivirus scanning with real-time updates\nis provided by DaRT 6.5's Standalone System Sweeper, and allows you to load\ndefinitions to a USB stick for live updating.\n\nThis ain't yo mama's BartPE compilation.\n\nOnce you dive into this disc, you'll never need another boot CD.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n                            O N   T H E   D I S C                             |\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nBased on Hiren's BootCD 13.0 Rebuild by DLC, minus some unnecessary clutter.\nMiniXP gutted and rebuilt with new, flexible on-disc scripting, for easy mods.\nActive File Recovery 7.5.1\nCCleaner 3.04\nCPU-Z 1.57\nHWMonitor 1.17\nKon-Boot 1.1 x86/x64 (the new, REAL 1.1 with 64-bit support)\nMS DaRT 5 / ERD Commander 2005 utilities\nHD Tune Pro 4.60\nImgBurn 2.5.5.0\nMagical Jelly Bean Keyfinder 2.0.8\nMyDefrag 4.3.1 with FullOptimize script\nNirSoft collection 3/1/2011, now with 90% fewer antivirus false alarms\nSoftPerfect Network Scanner 5.1.2\nTreeSize Personal 5.4.4\nFirefox Portable 3.6.14\nSpinRite 6.0 (under DOS -&gt; Hard Disk Tools)\nShiny graphics that make the room smell nicer\n\nAnd of course, a slew of utilities from Hiren's disc, some updated, including:\nEzPcFix, Acronis Disk Director, ATF Cleaner, Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware updated\n3/7/2011, Bulk Rename Utility, Combofix updated 3/2/2011, Defraggler, Speccy,\nContent Advisor Password Remover, Recuva, Diskview, Filemon, Regmon, Procmon,\nDriveImageXML, GetDataBack, Recover My Files, Ghost32 11.5.1, ISOBuster,\nGImageX (ImageX GUI), SUPERAntiSpyware, IrfanView, NTPWEdit, Partition Magic,\nTeraCopy, TightVNC Server/Viewer, Unstoppable Copier, Victoria, MHDD, WinRAR,\nand 7-Zip\n... among others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b19fcf6a0b45ec43b7254480f35460d73d538c1e","amp;dn":"FalconFour%5C%27s+Ultimate+Boot+CD%2FUSB+4.5+-+Hiren%5C%27s+13.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b19fcf6a0b45ec43b7254480f35460d73d538c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,159,207,106,11,69,236,67,183,37,68,128,243,84,96,215,61,83,140,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
