Now to make several online backups.\n\n&quot;In this demonstration, Nate explains and shows the process by which a piece of concept art is interpreted and used to model out a game environment in Maya. In the process, Nate will explain various modeling tools, techniques, and workflows, as well as numerous theories and methods used to create game art. A timelapse video of the entire modeling session is included so that the viewer can see and understand all the techniques being used. Nate will also cover common errors and mistakes to avoid so that the scene will run efficiently in real time and light correctly.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thegnomonworkshop.com/store/product/955/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thegnomonworkshop.com/store/product/955/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0b184c3bda26a96338fdcb1c6c4d5f5940b99bd","amp;dn":"The+Gnomon+Workshop+-+Environment+Modeling+for+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0b184c3bda26a96338fdcb1c6c4d5f5940b99bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,177,132,195,189,162,106,150,51,143,220,177,198,196,213,245,148,11,153,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
