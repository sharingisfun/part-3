In 2013, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made it dead simple to turn SketchUp into exactly what you need it to be. Need a special tool? ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an excellent chance someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already built it. Now you can research, download and install extensions without ever having to leave SketchUp. Every useful extension in one placeÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the all-new Extension Warehouse.\n \nPattern Fills\nDrawing a sectional view? Now you can fill shapes in LayOut with hatching and other patterns. Choose from a large library of standardsÃ¢â‚¬â€construction materials, geometric tiles, dot screensÃ¢â‚¬â€or create your own favorites. Patterns can be rotated, scaled or used as-is. You can even combine Pattern Fills with solid colors to create an endless number of variations.\n \nCopy Array\nYou know how SketchUp lets you easily create multiple copies of an object with your keyboard? Those are called arrays, and now LayOut lets you make them, too. Move a copy, type how many copies you want, type the letter Ã¢â‚¬ËœxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Enter. Presto! Presto! Presto! Presto! Presto! Copying is fun.\n \nSpeedier Vector Rendering\nWhen you need to print a drawing really big, sometimes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s helpful to vector-render your SketchUp model views. Doing so makes lines look smooth and reduces wait times for all but the most complex models. In the latest version of LayOut, vector rendering is faster than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever been.\n \nFaster Screen Redraw\nEvery time you zoom, pan or move an entity on the page, LayOut has to re-draw the picture you see on your screen. For this version, we massaged the code so thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a noticeable improvement in the speed at which this happens. LayOut should feel snappier, especially as your document gets more complex.\n \nNumbered Pages in the Pages panel\nAnother small but incredibly useful tweak: LayOutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pages panel now displays page numbers, which makes it easier to print and export portions of your document.\n \nCurved Label Leader Lines\nCreating a jauntily curved callout line for a label used to be a five-step, two-handed operation:\nClick. Click. Tool switch. Double-click. Click-drag-with-a-modifier-key.\nIn the latest version of LayOut, curving a label line goes like this:\nClick-drag.\nIsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t progress something?\n \nDashes in Dimensions\nAsk the guy with the 86 foot ceiling if readable dimensions are important. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little thing, but we added dashes to LayOutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dimension labels to make them easier to read.\n \nSmarter Toolbars in Windows\nIt used to be that the toolbars for all of your delicious plugins would move around your screen between SketchUp sessions. We heard that drove you crazy, so we re-engineered our Windows UI to make things a whole lot better. In 2013, you can even drag native tool icons between toolbars. Make SketchUp look the way you want it to.\n \nVideo Export\nExporting high-quality animations from SketchUp 2013 is easier than ever. Using the default settings yields HD videos at 720p, encoded in any of the three most popular, modern formats: H.264, AVI and WebM. Picture quality is much better, and file sizes are smaller as well.\n \nZoom In More\nWe increased LayOutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s maximum zoom capability by a factor of ten, from 1000% to 10,000%. At that magnification level, your sofa would be the size of Jupiter. Or thereabouts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a96258ddb9c2b206ae8746bfc743533ecb7eef","amp;dn":"Sketch+Up+2013+for+Mac+OS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00a96258ddb9c2b206ae8746bfc743533ecb7eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,169,98,88,221,185,194,178,6,174,135,70,191,199,67,83,62,203,126,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
