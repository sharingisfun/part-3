A beautiful fifteen-year old daughter, Ashlyn. A gorgeous brownstone on a tree-lined street in BostonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite Back Bay neighborhood. A great marriage, admired by friends and family. A perfect life.\n\nThis is what I know: Pain has a flavorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWhen investigator Tessa Leoni arrives at the crime scene in the DenbesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ home, she finds scuff marks on the floor and Taser confetti in the foyer. The family appears to have been abducted, with only a pile of their most personal possessions remaining behind. No witnesses, no ransom demands, no motive. Just an entire family, vanished without a trace.\n\nThis is what I fear: The worst is yet to comeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nTessa knows better than anyone that even the most perfect faÃƒÂ§ades can hide the darkest secrets. Now she must race against the clock to uncover the DenbesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ innermost dealings, a complex tangle of friendships and betrayal, big business and small sacrifices. Who would want to kidnap such a perfect little family? And how far would such a person be willing to go?\n\nThis is the truth: Love, safety, familyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦it is all touch and go.\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:823d356eb3e95b97dd46309a7466874f83792104","amp;dn":"Touch+%26amp%3B+Go+by+Lisa+Gardner+%7BPDF%2CEPUB%2C+MOBI%7D+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"823d356eb3e95b97dd46309a7466874f83792104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,61,53,110,179,233,91,151,221,70,48,154,116,102,135,79,131,121,33,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
