Helping to elucidate our understanding of this unique area with its abundance of valuable applications, this series includes volumes that investigate the structure, property, reactivity, and dynamics of atoms, molecules, and clusters. The scope of the series encompasses all things related to atoms, molecules, and clusters including both experimental and theoretical aspects. The major emphasis of the series is to analyze these aspects under two broad categories: approaches and applications.\r\n\r\nThe approaches category includes different levels of quantum mechanical theory with various computational tools augmented by available interpretive methods, as well as state-of-the-art experimental techniques for unraveling the characteristics of these systems including ultrafast dynamics strategies. Various simulation and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) protocols will also be included in the area of approaches.\r\n\r\nThe applications category includes topics like membranes, proteins, enzymes, drugs, biological systems, atmospheric and interstellar chemistry, solutions, zeolites, catalysis, aromatic systems, materials, and weakly bonded systems. Various devices exploiting electrical, mechanical, optical, electronic, thermal, piezoelectric, and magnetic properties of those systems also come under this purview","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861abc9510698f6fac3be33ae120fafcf04971ee","amp;dn":"Atoms%2C+Molecules%2C+and+Clusters+%5BUpdated+2016.08.31%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861abc9510698f6fac3be33ae120fafcf04971ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,26,188,149,16,105,143,111,172,59,227,58,225,32,250,252,240,73,113,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
