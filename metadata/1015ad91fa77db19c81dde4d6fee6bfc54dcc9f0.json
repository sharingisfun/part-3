There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games.

Verbatim or Taiyo yuden is preferred.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the\ntrick.\n\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nThis is the same as the original BioHazard: Code: Veronica for Dreamcast, with new cut-scenes that were not included in the original.\n\nThe game is otherwise almost the same, you still take control of Claire Redfield and Chris Redfield, who are searching for each other, while uncovering the secrets behind the Umbrella Corporation.\n\nThe Terror is Relentless! It stalks its prey with cunning. Its reflexes...lightning fast...its power...terrifying. Now it's after you! You are Claire Redfield as her next nightmare begins in the most chilling game series of all time. Experience a new chapter in survival horror. After surviving the horrific onslaught in Raccoon City, Claire now arrives in Europe following new clues regarding her missing brother and Umbrella Corporation's insidious activities. Once inside Umbrella's remote lab, she discovers that her terrifying ordeal is far from over. The nightmare continues. \n\nIn Resident Evil: Code Veronica X, players will control Claire at the beginning of the game and later can control Chris Redfield in their efforts to stop Umbrella's devious plans. One of the many features that makes Code Veronica different from previous Resident Evil games is the Real World System (R.W.S.). Now when Claire opens doors, solves puzzles, stores items or ammunition, they remain in the same spot when playing the second half of the game as Chris. \n\nResident Evil: Code Veronica X will contain several enhancements including creating an accessible map system so that item boxes and typewriters the players has found are marked on the map and not forgotten. With the new map system each door is coded a different color indicating gameplay status. Now by looking at the color of the door, players will know which ones they have already opened, which ones they have keys to open, and which doors can not be opened until the player finds the keys. \n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* The nightmare plague of the Resident Evil adventure now spreads to Ps2. \n  \n* Command Claire Redfield as she searches to locate her missing brother, \n  S.T.A.R.S. member, Chris Redfield. \n\n* Graphics so real, so terrifying...you'll beg to keep the lights on. \n\n* New 1st-Person perspective battles take you directly into the horrifying drama.\n\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media\nisn't working.\n\n\nIf using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM \n(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1015ad91fa77db19c81dde4d6fee6bfc54dcc9f0","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+Code+Veronica+X+%5BNTSC%5D%2C+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1015ad91fa77db19c81dde4d6fee6bfc54dcc9f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,21,173,145,250,119,219,25,200,29,222,77,111,238,107,252,84,220,201,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
