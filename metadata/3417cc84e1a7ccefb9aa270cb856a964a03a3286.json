Cut commercials out of video stream.\n\nEspecially, only small parts on start and end points will be re-encoded, the middle part will remain untouched, lossless. This gives highest speed while reserving highest video quality. So it is called 'Smart Rendering'.\n\nNo need to be worried about formats, frame rate or file sizes, the functions of video join, split and cut can be easily achieved by Smart Cutter. The video editing software allows you to edit video files in all popular formats from DV Camcorder and HD PVR.\n\nAll subtitles and audios in the movie will also be cut and saved without re-encoding.\n\nAs a video joiner, splitter and cutter, Smart Cutter has an intuitive interface and makes it easy to turn original videos into works of art. And also you can watch the video in the preview window. Smart Cutter is well worthy of having a try.\n\nJoin multiple videos and combine them into one\nSplit one video into several segments\nCut off the unwanted segments of your video\nSmart Seek to locate any frame in movies easily and fast:\n\nSince version 1.2.0, the long slider's seeking speed is much faster than old versions, it makes fast jumping through different scenes in the H.264 AVCHD video much easier.\n\nThis major improvement is based on our new technology 'smart seek', which was accomplished by our developers after hard optimization. Since long time ago, the mostly experienced difficulty while editing H.264 AVCHD video was: it is very hard to locate the video frame you desired in the H.264 AVCHD movie; after you dragged the mouse wheel, it usually takes too much waiting before the video scene you \nwanted to be displayed.\n\nBut now, with the help of 'smart seek', you can reveiw and jump to the H.264 AVCHD video scenes as fast as you did to AVI MPEG and other 'simpler' video formats. After you found the scene you needed by the long slider, the short slider will help you to locate every single video frame efficiently. Now, You need not to click the mouse button so many times, step by step dozens(H.264 AVCHD mostly has GOP of more than 33 frames) of frames to your desired one.\nJust drag the short slider, each frame will be shown continuously and smoothly. You can decide the cut point very easily and fast.\n\nStream Fix to ensure a correct output:\n\nUnlike the MPEG2 video streams, the H.264 AVCHD video takes some special elements into its stream structure for playback control. If some video cutter simply chops the H.264 AVCHD video stream apart, then feeds the cut movie into some post-processing pipelines, such as transport stream re-multiplexing, Blue Ray disk authorizing; then, there may(even must) arise the problems of green glitch, mozaic, or audio/video in-sync.\n\nThe inner stream-fix function will solve such kind of problems. It was done automatically during the process of video transcoding.\n\nAccurate grabber to capture any frame in movies:\n\nCapture any frame in all popular video formats. Fit for professional users.\n\nInput File Format Support\nVideo\t MP4, MOV, MPEG, H.264 AVC, VOB\nAVCHD Video (*.mts, *.m2ts), MPEG2 HD Video (*.mpg; *.mpeg), H.264 TS HD Video (*.ts), MPEG-2 TS HD Video (*.ts)\nAudio\tMP3, AAC, WAV, CDA, FLAC, APE, CUE, AC3, MP2, AIFF, AU, MPA\nOutput File Format Support\nVideo\tMP4, MOV, MPEG, H.264 AVC, VOB\nAVCHD Video (*.mts, *.m2ts), MPEG2 HD Video (*.mpg; *.mpeg), H.264 TS HD Video (*.ts), MPEG-2 TS HD Video (*.ts)\nAudio\tMP3, AAC, WAV, CDA, FLAC, APE, CUE, AC3, MP2, AIFF, AU, MPA\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: MicrosoftÃ‚Â® Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7\nProcessor: 1GHz Intel/AMD processor or above\nRAM: 512MB RAM (1000MB or above recommended)\nFree Hard Disk: 60MB space for installation\nGraphic Card: Super VGA (800Ãƒâ€”600) resolution, 16-bit graphics card or higher\n\nHomepage: http://www.fame-ring.com/smart_cutter.html\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n- Install program.\n- Run application, click at options,Register application with given Key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3417cc84e1a7ccefb9aa270cb856a964a03a3286","amp;dn":"Smart+Cutter+for+DV+and+DVB+v1.9.1+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3417cc84e1a7ccefb9aa270cb856a964a03a3286","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,23,204,132,225,167,204,239,185,170,39,12,184,86,169,100,160,58,50,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
