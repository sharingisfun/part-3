They mixed in the angst of being trapped in \na nowhere city, the crisis of spiritual identity and a love of rebellious noise \nand came out with &quot;Mental Jewelry.&quot; The three songs from that CD here lay out \nthe blueprint for the next couple decades of LIVE material. Earnest vocals with \nlyrics that reflect a quest for spiritual ascendance. \n\nUnder the hand of Talking Head Jerry Harrison, who kept the band&amp;#039;s recorded \nsound dense and textured, LIVE got better fast. They cut a masterpiece on the \nsecond try. &quot;Throwing Copper&quot; opened with the shouts of &quot;Lightning Crashes&quot; and \n&quot;Selling The Drama,&quot; contained the fighting &quot;I Alone,&quot; and the moral diatribe of \n&quot;White, Discussion.&quot; This was a powerful, passionate album and it made them \nstars. The follow up, &quot;Secret Samadhi,&quot; was darker in tone but more direct. \n&quot;Turn My Head&quot; was the closest thing to an actual love song, and &quot;Lakini&amp;#039;s \nJuice&quot; mirrored Led Zepplin more than U2. \n\nIt was right about now that LIVE began to lose their footing. &quot;The Distance To \nHere&quot; began a shift towards a maturity that took away from the band&amp;#039;s edge. \nWhile Ed Kowlaczyk may claim that this is his favorite of the LIVE albums, it is \nthe point where LIVE began to experiment with their basic sound. On &quot;Distance&amp;#039;s&quot; \nbest song, &quot;The Dolphin&amp;#039;s Cry,&quot; it works, but for most of the album, it just \nseemed uncharacteristic. &quot;V&quot; suffered from the same hodgepodge (Tricky rapping \nwith Ed, too much electronic noodling, etc), but it also contained the \ntranscendent &quot;Overcome,&quot; which seemed to appear from nowhere after the horror of \n9/11, giving voice to the feelings of a national anguish. &quot;Birds Of Pray&quot; tries \nto return to form, but comes off as over baked. While the duet with Shelby \nLynne, &quot;Run Away,&quot; is terrific, the cheesy religious ballad &quot;Heaven&quot; is entirely \nforgettable. Fortunately, &quot;Awake!&quot; closes with a fine cover of Johnny Cash&amp;#039;s &quot;I \nWalk The Line.&quot; \n\nPS: The bonus DVD with the deluxe version is definitely worth picking up. In \naddition to a few of the songs left of the CD, (&quot;Freaks,&quot; &quot;They Stood Up For \nLove&quot; and a couple live tracks), you get &quot;Simple Creed,&quot; probably one of the two \ndecent tracks from &quot;V.&quot; The other &quot;V&quot; video for &quot;Overcome&quot; may be a tougher \nwatch, as it is made from 9/11 footage. It&amp;#039;s also worth getting to see the \nyouthful exuberance of LIVE&amp;#039;s first video, &quot;Operation Spirit.&quot; \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSmile And Enjoy!!!!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b5846f7ae1261eb0a19e1dfbd4870ef9a833ab5","amp;dn":"Live+-+Awake+%28the+Best+of%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b5846f7ae1261eb0a19e1dfbd4870ef9a833ab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,88,70,247,174,18,97,235,10,25,225,223,189,72,112,239,154,131,58,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
