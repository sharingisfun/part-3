He gained prominence as a member of the British progressive rock group Genesis, which he joined in 1970 and left in 1977 to pursue a solo career. Hackett contributed to six Genesis studio albums, three live albums and seven singles.[2]\n\nIn 1986, Hackett co-founded the supergroup GTR with another progressive guitarist, Steve Howe of Yes and Asia. The group released a self-titled album that year, which peaked at #11 on the Billboard 200 in the United States and spawned the Top 20 single &quot;When the Heart Rules the Mind&quot;.[1] When Hackett left GTR in 1987, the group disbanded.\n\nAfter leaving GTR, Hackett resumed his solo career and has released albums and toured on a regular basis since. His body of work has encompassed many styles, such as progressive rock, world music, and classical. His playing has influenced guitarists such as Eddie Van Halen, Alex Lifeson, Brian May and Steve Rothery.[3][4][5] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a51a69c5be58d5e3b97bd167d816a43f51e15cf","amp;dn":"Steve+Hackett-Complete+Discography+FLAC%281975-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a51a69c5be58d5e3b97bd167d816a43f51e15cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,81,166,156,91,229,141,94,59,151,189,22,125,129,106,67,245,30,21,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
