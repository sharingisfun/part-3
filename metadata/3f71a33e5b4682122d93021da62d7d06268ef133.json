Files are being decrypted even in a case when the system is not bootable and so you cannot log on, and/or some encryption keys have been tampered. Besides, decryption is possible even when Windows is protected using SYSKEY. AEFSDR effectively (and instantly) decrypts the files protected under all versions Windows Server 2003 (Standard and Enterprise), Windows XP (including Service Packs 1 and 2) and Windows 2000 (including Service Packs 1, 2, 3 and 4).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f71a33e5b4682122d93021da62d7d06268ef133","amp;dn":"Advanced+EFS+Data+Recovery+Pro+v4.02.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f71a33e5b4682122d93021da62d7d06268ef133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,113,163,62,91,70,130,18,45,147,2,29,166,45,125,6,38,142,241,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
