But as great as Mr. Clapton has been there, his true genius is derived from his work on the stage. His live work contains some of the most electrifying and influential guitar work in rock history. On Crossroads 2, you get four disks of amazing live performances from Slowhand from the 1970's. All of the classics are here and if you are a guitar aficionado, then Crossroads 2 is a must for your collection.\n\nEric Clapton - Crossroads 2 - Live In The Seventies (4 CD Boxset)\n\nReleased April 2, 1996 \nRecorded 1974-1978 \nLength 266:55 \nLabel Polydor\n\n\nCrossroads 2: Live in the Seventies is a live album by Eric Clapton, released in 1996. Unlike the first Crossroads box set that encompasses more than three decades of Clapton's work, Crossroads 2 is a chronicle of Clapton's live shows between 1974 through 1979. Much of the focus is on longer renditions of electric blues.\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nDisc 1:\n01 -- Walkin' Down The Road -- 5:17 \n02 -- Have You Ever Loved A Woman -- 7:42 \n03 -- Willie And The Hand Jive - Get Ready -- 11:42 \n04 -- Can't Find My Way Home -- 5:19 \n05 -- Driftin' Blues - Rambling On My Mind -- 11:37 \n06 -- Presence Of The Lord -- 8:48 \n07 -- Rambling On My Mind - Have You Ever Loved A Woman -- 8:17 \n08 -- Little Wing -- 6:43 \n09 -- The Sky Is Crying - Have You Ever Loved A Woman - Rambling On My Mind -- 7:40 \n\nDisc 2:\n01 -- Layla -- 5:38 \n02 -- Further On Up The Road -- 4:32 \n03 -- I Shot The Sheriff -- 10:21 \n04 -- Badge -- 10:43 \n05 -- Driftin' Blues -- 6:58 \n06 -- Eyesight To The Blind - Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad? -- 24:20 \n\nDisc 3:\n01 -- Tell The Truth -- 8:57 \n02 -- Knockin' On Heaven's Door -- 5:20 \n03 -- Stormy Monday -- 13:02 \n04 -- Lay Down Sally -- 5:23 \n05 -- The Core -- 9:14 \n06 -- We're All The Way -- 2:55 \n07 -- Cocaine -- 6:38 \n08 -- Goin' Down Slow - Rambling On My Mind -- 13:46 \n09 -- Mean Old Frisco -- 5:53 \n\nDisc 4:\n01 -- Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever -- 4:23 \n02 -- Worried Life Blues -- 5:59 \n03 -- Tulsa Time -- 4:31 \n04 -- Early In The Morning -- 6:20 \n05 -- Wonderful Tonight -- 6:24 \n06 -- Kind Hearted Woman -- 5:18 \n07 -- Double Trouble -- 11:06 \n08 -- Crossroads -- 5:22 \n09 -- To Make Somebody Happy -- 5:14 \n10 -- Cryin' -- 3:00 \n11 -- Water On The Ground -- 2:59 \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508c38bba4519ab223d4ced83371b6f9ab720137","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Crossroads+2-+Live+In+The+Seventies+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508c38bba4519ab223d4ced83371b6f9ab720137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,140,56,187,164,81,154,178,35,212,206,216,51,113,182,249,171,114,1,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
