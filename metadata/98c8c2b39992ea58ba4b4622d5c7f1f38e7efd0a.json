His magnum opus was a sequence of interlinked short stories and novels collectively entitled LA COMÃƒâ€°DIE HUMAINE, which presents a panorama of French life in the years after the 1815 fall of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nBalzac's unfiltered representation of society and keen observation of detail, especially the detail of objects, to illustrate the lives of his characters made him an early pioneer of literary realism.   While he admired and drew inspiration from the Romantic style of Walter Scott, Balzac sought to depict human existence through the use of particulars.  In the preface to the first edition of ScÃƒÂ¨nes de la Vie privÃƒÂ©e, he wrote: &quot;The author firmly believes that details alone will henceforth determine the merit of works.&quot;\n\nHe is renowned for his multifaceted characters, who are morally ambiguous.  His writing influenced many subsequent novelists such as Proust, Zola, Dickens, Poe, Dostoevsky, Flaubert, James, Faulkner, Kerouac, Calvino, and philosophers such as Marx and Engels, the latter of whom wrote: &quot;I have learned more [from Balzac] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* COUSIN BETTE: Part One of Poor Relations (Penguin Classics, 2004).
