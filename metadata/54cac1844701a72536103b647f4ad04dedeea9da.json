The 1080p video looks great and the riffs are clear but aren't too loud. Please leave any feedback regarding this repackaged release.\n\nA very special thanks to the anonymous author of the remastered rifftrax who also did the initial muxing with the high definition video and provided the intro mp3. And as always, big thanks to the posters of the original 1080p/5.1 encode of the movie, the subs and the chapters.\n\nIf these Rifftrax were enjoyable, you haven't paid for them and you have a few dollars to spare, please consider purchasing these riffs (3.99USD) or make a general donation (5USD and up) - they take Bitcoin now too   \n\nPlease check out other Rifftrax, Star Trek Enterprise, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, documentaries and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54cac1844701a72536103b647f4ad04dedeea9da","amp;dn":"Road+House+%281989%29+1080p+Rifftrax+6ch+2ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54cac1844701a72536103b647f4ad04dedeea9da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,202,193,132,71,1,167,37,54,16,59,100,127,74,208,77,237,238,169,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
