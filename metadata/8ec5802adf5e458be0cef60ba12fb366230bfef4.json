Yet, one of the major reasons this St. Albans, England quintet only had three hits, despite being one of the best singles-orientated bands of their day, is that popular music was not quite ready for their tricky time changes and winding melodies. Certainly, the quality of the material was not a problem. A survey of Absolutely the Best, which collects sixteen of The Zombies' greatest tracks, reveals a plethora of almost perfect pop-rock singles, such as the gently rolling\n&quot;Remember You;&quot; the hauntingly bleak &quot;Imagine the Swan;&quot; the masterful alternations between jazz-ish virtuosity and R&amp;B-ish oomph, &quot;Is This the Dream&quot; and &quot;Just Out of Reach;&quot; and the remarkably clever &quot;Whenever You're Ready,&quot; which is probably the best snide, offhand rejection song this side of Bob Dylan's &quot;Don't Think Twice It's Alright.&quot; Then there are the hits: The frantic &quot;She's Not There,&quot; the serene &quot;Tell Her No&quot; and the playful &quot;Time of the Season,&quot; all of which are bonafied classics.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.She's not there                                      [02:23]\n02.Leave me be                                          [02:07]\n03.Tell her no                                          [02:06]\n04.The way I feel inside                                [01:47]\n05.She's coming home                                    [02:37]\n06.Nothing's changed                                    [02:30]\n07.I want you back again                                [02:13]\n08.Whenever you're ready                                [02:41]\n09.If it don't work out                                 [02:26]\n10.I love you                                           [03:21]\n11.Is this the dream                                    [02:43]\n12.Remember you                                         [01:58]\n13.Just out of reach                                    [02:08]\n14.Gotta get A hold of myself                           [02:28]\n15.Time of the season                                   [03:32]\n16.Imagine the swab                                     [03:09]\n____\n\n40:09 min\n 41,6 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
