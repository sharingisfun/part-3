This is useful, for instance, if an application which is installed by the operating system becomes damaged and needs to be reinstalled without the hassle of reinstalling all of Mac OS X, or if you want to inspect a downloaded package to see what it will install before installing it. Pacifist is also able to verify existing installations and find missing or altered files*, and Pacifist can also examine the kernel extensions installed in your system to let you see what installer installed them, and whether the installer was made by Apple or a third-party.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11177da1d62291c80b70aa6f36f11a10687cc93e","amp;dn":"Pacifist+v3.2.3+%2B+KeyGen+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11177da1d62291c80b70aa6f36f11a10687cc93e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,23,125,161,214,34,145,200,11,112,170,111,54,241,26,16,104,124,201,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
