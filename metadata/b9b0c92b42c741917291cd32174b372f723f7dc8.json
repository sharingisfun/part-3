It is Mexico's busiest airport by both passenger traffic and aircraft movements. Although this was not its official name for several decades, it was formally named after the 19th century president Benito JuÃƒÂ¡rez in 2006, and is Mexico's main international and domestic gateway. In recent years Toluca airport has become an alternate airport.\n\nThis hot and high airport is served by 31 domestic and international airlines and offers direct flights to more than 100 destinations worldwide. In 2010, the airport served 24,130,535 passengers. In optimal conditions, and with the current renovations and expansion projects completed, the Benito JuÃƒÂ¡rez airport will be able to handle up to 32 million passengers per year. It provides non-stop services from Mexico City to North America, Central America and Caribbean, South America, Europe and Asia (Aeromexico is the only airline that flies to Far East from Mexico City).\n\nAs the main hub for Mexico's largest airline AeromÃƒÂ©xico and a secondary hub for its subsidiary AeromÃƒÂ©xico Connect, the airport has become a SkyTeam hub. It is also a hub for Interjet and a focus city for VivaAerobus.\n\nMexico City International Airport is the Latin America's second busiest airport by passenger traffic after Guarulhos Airport in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil and the busiest airport by aircraft movements.
