Lively, original, and powerfully informative, Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar . . . is a not-so-reverent crash course through the great philosophical thinkers and traditions, from Existentialism (What do Hegel and Bette Midler have in common?) to Logic (Sherlock Holmes never deduced anything). Philosophy 101 for those who like to take the heavy stuff lightly, this is a joy to readÃ¢â‚¬â€and finally, it all makes sense!\n \n  \n  \n[size=&quot;150&quot;][b][color=green]HASH:[/color][color=red] 6B26E4D0AFC5114FBFCEA56595436C21F4E5A991[/color][color=green]\n COPY above hash and paste it in the box on[/color][color=blue] www.Thelocalbay.com[/color][color=green] to download the torrent file[/color][/b][/size]\n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b26e4d0afc5114fbfcea56595436c21f4e5a991","amp;dn":"Plato+and+Platypus+Walk+into+a+Bar+-+Understanding+Philosophy+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b26e4d0afc5114fbfcea56595436c21f4e5a991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,38,228,208,175,197,17,79,191,206,165,101,149,67,108,33,244,229,169,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
