It allows one computer to run multiple operating systems, leading to a more efficient use of hardware resources. In this course Martin Guidry explores the crucial concepts behind today's virtualization tech, its pros and cons, common uses, and hardware requirements. He dedicates two chapters to Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware Workstation, two of the most popular hypervisors, and then shows how to prep your existing infrastructure to accommodate virtualization. Before you leave, make sure to watch the tutorials on troubleshooting and backing up your virtual machines, so you can fix problems and recover your work in case of a system failure.\nTopics include:\n\nUnderstanding the advantages and disadvantages of virtualization\nVirtualizing computer desktops\nDesigning a private cloud\nChoosing the best virtualization solution for you\nCreating a virtual machine with Hyper-V and VMware Workstation\nConfiguring your network for virtualization\nBacking up, restoring, and migrating virtual machines\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e948badb4b14eca8c69b3934115bc4e1842885af","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Virtualization+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e948badb4b14eca8c69b3934115bc4e1842885af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,72,186,219,75,20,236,168,198,155,57,52,17,91,196,225,132,40,133,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
