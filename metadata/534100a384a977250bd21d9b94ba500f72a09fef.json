It was the short film that preceeded the Feature. To this day I don't remember what the Feature was, but I have always remembered this movie. It is a wonderful childrens movie. The language is French and I have Hardcoded English Subs into it. DON'T WORRY! There is very little dialogue and only 10 instances of Subtitles. If you are English speaking, the French language will be no problem because there are few spoken words. If you are French speaking the English subtitles should be no problem because there are so few of them.\n\n  This is the story of a 6 year old parisian boy who finds a red balloon on his way to school. Or rather it finds him. Everybody, it seems is rather keen to see the boy get rid of the balloon. He arrives at school and is not allowed to bring the balloon in with him. He lets it go and it flies off, only to be waiting for him at the end of the day, hovering outside in the school yard. Further adventures ensue throughout the day until some bullies pop the balloon culminating in a spectacular ending for the boy.\n\n  Starring: Pascal Lamorisse, The Red Balloon.\n\n  Directed by: Albert Lamorisse.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  34min.\n\n  Language: French (Hardcoded English Subtitles).\n\n  Size: 640 x  480\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:534100a384a977250bd21d9b94ba500f72a09fef","amp;dn":"The+Red+Balloon+%28Le+Ballon+Rouge%29+%281956%29+%2834+minute+Short+Film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"534100a384a977250bd21d9b94ba500f72a09fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,65,0,163,132,169,119,37,11,210,29,155,148,186,80,15,114,160,159,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
