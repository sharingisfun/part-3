However, all good things must soon come to an end - and the picturesque resort falls into madness, carnage and chaos after a mysterious and contagious zombie outbreak claims its once peaceful atmosphere. Cut off from the rest of the world, only four individuals who strangely find themselves immune to zombification have the power to protect the remaining survivors from the horrors of the island, to discover what's really going on and find a way to escape before their own fatal ends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f394a7a9fbcc8705d04381822eaa0815f8670b7d","amp;dn":"Dead+Island%3A+Game+of+the+Year+Edition+%5BPS3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f394a7a9fbcc8705d04381822eaa0815f8670b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,148,167,169,251,204,135,5,208,67,129,130,46,170,8,21,248,103,11,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
