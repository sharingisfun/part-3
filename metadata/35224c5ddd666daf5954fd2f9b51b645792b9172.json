But I was quite astonished as I flicked through the volume to find that the feeling aroused inside me wasn't what I expected, sensual but not sexual. The images capture a quality not seen in our society. A certain fundamental and naked truth about the subjects, and I'm not just talking about the female model, but the landscape, flowers... also. Some people call this naivity, innocence (I don't think those models are very innocent somehow), but to me a somewhat simplistic, inert and senual quality that modern society chooses to ignore. Pornography, erotic art? You be your own judge.
