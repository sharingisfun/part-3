It provides a comprehensive treatment of linear and nonlinear Fredholm and Volterra integral equations of the first and second kinds. The materials are presented in an accessible and straightforward manner to readers, particularly those from non-mathematics backgrounds. Numerous well-explained applications and examples as well as practical exercises are presented to guide readers through the text. Selected applications from mathematics, science and engineering are investigated by using the newly developed methods. This volume consists of nine chapters, pedagogically organized, with six chapters devoted to linear integral equations, two chapters on nonlinear integral equations, and the last chapter on applications. It is intended for scholars and researchers, and can be used for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics, science and engineering.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface to the Second Edition\nPreface to the First Edition\n1 Introductory Concepts\n2 Fredholm Integral Equations\n3 Volterra Integral Equations\n4 Fredholm Integro-Differential Equations\n5 Volterra Integro-Differential Equations\n6 Singular Integral Equations\n7 Nonlinear Fredholm Integral Equations\n8 Nonlinear Volterra Integral Equations\n9 Applications of Integral Equations\nA Table of Indefinite Integrals\nB Integrals Involving Irrational Algebraic Functions\nC Series\nD The Error and the Gamma Functions\nAnswers to Exercises\nBibliography\nIndex\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s24.postimg.org/om0vly15h/A_First_Course_in_Integral_Equations_2nd_Ed_a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s24.postimg.org/om0vly15h/A_First_Course_in_Integral_Equations_2nd_Ed_a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14eed4f5a543ac01d109070ae70ab747b48b8dc9","amp;dn":"A+First+Course+in+Integral+Equations+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14eed4f5a543ac01d109070ae70ab747b48b8dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,238,212,245,165,67,172,1,209,9,7,10,231,10,183,71,180,139,141,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
