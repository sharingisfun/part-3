This program reveals the discoveries of a forgotten genius, many of which went unnoticed for nearly a century. How did this obscure visionary from what is now Yugoslavia lay the foundation for modern communication and which of his inventions were considered a little too revolutionary by government agencies and the power brokers of the time. Among his discoveries are: fluorescent light, the laser beam, wireless communications, wireless transmission of electrical energy, remote control, robotics, Tesla?s turbines and vertical take off aircraft. Tesla is the father of the radio and the modern electrical transmission system. Tesla registered over 700 patents worldwide.
