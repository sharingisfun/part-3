Accelerated innovation in both major domains of solar energy (photovoltaics and concentrated solar power) has resulted in the rapid fall of the solar electricity price, opening the route to a number of practical applications using solar H2. New thermochemical water splitting using concentrated solar power (CSP) as well as CSP coupled to electrolysis has the potential to convert and store solar energy into clean hydrogen using a tiny fraction of the world's desert area to meet our present and future global energy needs. Photovoltaics, in turn, has the versatility required for supporting the creation of a distributed energy generation infrastructure in developing countries especially now that the price of PV solar electricity has fallen to unprecedented low levels. In all these cases, solar H2 will be used to store energy and release it on demand either for fuel cells (to power homes and boats) or internal combustion engines and turbines (for powering cars, trucks and in thermoelectric power units). This book on solar hydrogen is unique in its field and is a timely treatment of a hot topic in industry, academic, political and environmental circles. With reference to many examples as well as to new technologies, this accessible book provides insight into a crucial technology for our common future and numerous colour pictures contribute to the book's readability. Written by experts in the field who are engaged at the forefront of research, the book supplies readers with last minute insight from the frontiers of research. The book will be of interest to Politicians, solar PV companies, hydrogen and sustainability researchers, environmentalists, managers in the automotive and nautical industries, undergraduate and graduate students in physics, chemistry, energy and materials science.\n\nAbout the Authors\nMario Pagliaro is a chemistry and management scholar based in Palermo at ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CNR where, since 2008, he has also led SicilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Photovoltaics Research Pole. MarioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research focuses on the development of functional materials for a variety of uses and operates at the boundaries of chemistry and materials science. He has co-authored more than 100 scientific and technical papers as well as 12 scientific and management books, including two highly cited volumes, on silica-based materials and glycerol chemistry.\nAthanasios G. Konstandopoulos is the Founder and has been the Director of the Aerosol &amp; Particle Technology (APT) Laboratory at CPERI/CERTH (Thermi, Greece) since 1996. He has also been a member of the faculty of Chemical Engineering at the Aristotle University since 2006, currently serving as Professor of New, Advanced&amp; Clean Combustion Technologies. He is a specialist in nanoparticles and combustion aerosols.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface\nAbout the Authors\nAbout the Authors xvii\nChapter 1 Hydrogen and Solar Hydrogen 1\nChapter 2 Water Electrolysis with Solar Electricity 40\nChapter 3 Thermochemical Water Splitting 82\nChapter 4 Solar Hydrogen Utilization 119\nSubject Index 155","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e46a8ebe2d491f943527c9a9615abb9bce84149","amp;dn":"Solar+Hydrogen+-+Fuel+of+the+Future+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e46a8ebe2d491f943527c9a9615abb9bce84149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,70,168,235,226,212,145,249,67,82,124,154,150,21,171,185,188,232,65,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
