They're planting tomatoes in raised beds, runner beans in small plots, and strawberries in containers. But there is one place that has, until now, been woefully neglected Ã¢â‚¬â€ the front yard.\n\nAnd there's good reason. The typical veggie garden, with its raised beds and plots, is not the most attractive type of garden, and favorite edible plants like tomatoes and cucumbers have a tendency to look a scraggily, even in their prime. But The Edible Front Yard isn't about the typical veggie garden, and author Ivette Soler is passionate about putting edibles up front and creating edible gardens with curb appeal.\n\nSoler offers step-by-step instructions for converting all or part of a lawn into an edible paradise; specific guidelines for selecting and planting the most attractive edible plants; and design advice and plans for the best placement and for combining edibles with ornamentals in pleasing ways. Inspiring and accessible, The Edible Front Yard is a one-stop resource for a front-and-center edible garden that is both beautiful and bountiful all year-round.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d489e3183e05b787e933babd83326c7e02d10e5","amp;dn":"The+Edible+Front+Yard%3A+The+Mow+Less%2C+Grow+More+Plan+for+a+Beauti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d489e3183e05b787e933babd83326c7e02d10e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,72,158,49,131,224,91,120,126,147,59,171,216,51,38,199,224,45,16,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
