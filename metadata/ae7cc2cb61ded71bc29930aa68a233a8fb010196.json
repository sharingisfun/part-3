In the 1990s, their sound was described as a genre-defying blend of sci-fi metal/electronic and experimental, but into the new millennium they invoked a heavier sound leaning more towards aggressive metal. Due to their heavy use of German lyrics, Germanic imagery and German-sounding pseudonyms, they are often mistaken for being a German band, and are largely regarded as the only existing American Neue Deutsche HÃƒÂ¤rte band of note. Contrary to a generalized public perception, Kaizer Von Loopy and Vas Kallas are based in New York City to which they are native, and neither of them is German or of German descent.\n\nDiscography 10 Releases - ID3 Tagged - MP3 Format\n\n[Singles]\n1995 - Shine 2001\n1997 - Take Me To Your Leader\n2006 - OktÃƒÂ¶tenfest\n\n[Albums]\n1995 - Ausgeflippt\n1997 - Transmissions From Uranus\n2003 - ÃƒÅ“ber Alles\n2004 - Scheissmessiah\n2008 - 2012: Zwanzig ZwÃƒÂ¶lf\n2012 - Born To Be Heiled\n2013 - Hanzel Und Gretyl FÃƒÂ¼r Immer\n\nBit Rates are bit inconsistent.
