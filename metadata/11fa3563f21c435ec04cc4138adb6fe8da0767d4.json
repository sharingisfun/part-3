Aptly described by the New York Times as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œplayful chanteuseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ActorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ finds multi-instrumentalist Clark drawing inspiration from a selection of her favourite films, from Disney to horror, with compelling results.\n\nThose familiar with St. Vincent will be well aware of her penchant for abrupt and extremely dark shifts in mood, a skill she has honed and exercises to even greater extent throughout ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ActorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Musically, this second release is far more reflective of lyrical content, the listener kept in a constant sense of unknowing through the diverse variations in mood and dynamic, unpredictable structures.\n\nFrom the moment opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The StrangersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ begins the album has a definite air of fantasy about it. Choral harmonies, whimsical instrumentation and the re-occurring ominous lyric ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpaint the black hole blackerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ seem to comfort and unsettle in equal amounts. Only when the fearsome guitars emerge is the listeners unease validated and relieved. The album continues in a similar fashion, twisting and turning through wildly differing styles. From the garage rock sounding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Actor Out of WorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, to the trip-hop tinged ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Save Me From What I WantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, to the epic string crescendo of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Black RainbowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the album constantly seeks to surprise, and, on the whole, succeeds.\n\nOne element remains consistent for the duration of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ActorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the fact that each individual track is, at its root, exceptionally well crafted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the many layers are present to accentuate, not disguise. John Congleton is, as always, impressive behind the desk and ensures that this does not go unnoticed, never allowing the heart of the pieces to be lost in the fantastic/eccentric arrangements.\n\nBest summed up by the track title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Laughing with a Mouth of BloodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, this is enchanting pop, with lush arrangements, beautifully reserved vocals and genuinely menacing sinister turns. Those prepared to invest their time will most likely find ClarkeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rose and thorn approach enticing and undeniably impressive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11fa3563f21c435ec04cc4138adb6fe8da0767d4","amp;dn":"St.+Vincent+-+Actor+%282009%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11fa3563f21c435ec04cc4138adb6fe8da0767d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,250,53,99,242,28,67,94,192,76,196,19,138,219,111,232,218,7,103,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
