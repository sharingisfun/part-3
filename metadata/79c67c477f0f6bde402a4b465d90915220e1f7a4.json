It was co-produced by Weather Report collaborator Ron Malo and released in 1980. In contrast to the band's previous all-instrumental effort, several songs were sung by bassist Jeff Berlin. \r\n\r\nThe closing Dave Stewart composition 'Land's End' includes music previously used on the opening and closing tracks of the National Health album Of &quot;Queues and Cures&quot;\r\nThis is the third Bill Bruford studio-album he made with his band and it is without doubt an enjoyable Jazz-Fusion album with excellent tracks in this genre; but listen for yourself.\r\n\r\nThis is intelligent fusion â€“ intricately crafted, high energy, and technically impressive. \r\n\r\nBill Bruford has distinguished himself from the majority of rock musicians with a consistent drive to experiment and challenge himself artistically. He composes innovative tunes with subtle rhythmic twists, often in odd meters, and his drumming is always musical and very precise. \r\n\r\nThis is the third studio release of the fusion group that he assembled in 1977. Gradually Going Tornado attempted to further streamline the group's approach and introduced the vocal work of the brilliant electric bassist Jeff Berlin (heavily influenced by Jack Bruce and Jaco Pastorius).\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
