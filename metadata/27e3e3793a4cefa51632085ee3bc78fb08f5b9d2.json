Come inhabit an exotic world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?\nWho are you?\nPlay the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a pure-strain descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domesÃ¢â‚¬â€the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the Holy City; the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul; or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.\n\nYou arrive at the oasis-hamlet of Joppa, along the far rim of Moghra'yi, the Great Salt Desert. All around you, moisture farmers tend to groves of viridian watervine. There are huts wrought from rock salt and brinestalk. On the horizon, Qud's jungles strangle chrome steeples and rusted archways to the earth. Further and beyond, the fabled Spindle rises above the fray and pierces the cloud-ribboned sky.\n\nYou clutch your rifle, or your vibroblade, or your tattered scroll, or your poisonous stinger, or your hypnotized goat. You approach a watervine farmerÃ¢â‚¬â€he lifts the brim of his straw hat and says, &quot;Live and drink, friend.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e3e3793a4cefa51632085ee3bc78fb08f5b9d2","amp;dn":"Caves+of+Qud+-+Early+Access","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e3e3793a4cefa51632085ee3bc78fb08f5b9d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,227,227,121,58,76,239,165,22,50,8,94,227,188,120,251,8,245,185,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
