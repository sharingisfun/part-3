Playing as Amatarasu, the sun goddess who takes on the form of a wolf, your goal is to bring life back to the world. Bringing life back to the world involves defeating lots of beasts. With each beast you defeat, the world's life force is restored just a bit, with colors and eventually people appearing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3983c2b934e7f2bab0e0ceb168c4800ebb6799","amp;dn":"Okami+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e3983c2b934e7f2bab0e0ceb168c4800ebb6799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,57,131,194,185,52,231,242,186,176,224,206,177,104,196,128,14,187,103,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
