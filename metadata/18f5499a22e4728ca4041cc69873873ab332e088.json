So was Sinners. Most artists make singles\nand hope they end up with a record. I prefer to make a record and\nhope I have singles. I love country music, and I am very reverent\nof the time that I have to make records. That's what we owe the\nindustry, the format, and the fans. We owe them a great record.&quot;\n\nFans will have the opportunity to see Eric on tour this spring on\nthe &quot;Young &amp; Wild Tour,&quot; reaching 37 cities across the country.\n\n&quot;I try to go out there on the road and be an ambassador for it,\nbecause I love country music so much, and I want to treat it\nright.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f5499a22e4728ca4041cc69873873ab332e088","amp;dn":"Eric_Church-Carolina-2009-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f5499a22e4728ca4041cc69873873ab332e088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,245,73,154,34,228,114,140,164,4,28,198,152,115,135,58,179,50,224,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
