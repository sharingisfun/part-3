Opening with a beautiful, introspective version of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Suzanne,&quot; Simone shows an obvious affinity for social statements with the Byrds' &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)&quot; and a trio of Dylan standards: &quot;I Shall Be Released,&quot; &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,&quot; plus a dramatic, meditative &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin'.&quot; The title track, originally a 1967 hit for the Bee Gees and one year later for the Sweet Inspirations, suffers slightly from a weak, commercial-slanted arrangement, but her lone original, the two-part &quot;Revolution,&quot; is a great blend of blues-rock and soul testifying. Among a rut of jazz vocalists making the worst of a bad situation during the late '60s, To Love Somebody is a rare success.
