But tradition dictates that Zaza has to choose a young virgin. She must be beautiful and from a good family, preferably rich. Zaza&amp;#039;s parents, Yasha and Lily drag Zaza to meet potential brides and their families. Zaza has no choice. He plays along with his family, advocates of the suffocating traditions of their Georgian Jewish heritage. But Zaza always manages to somehow get out of being engaged. What his parents don&amp;#039;t know is that Zaza is already in love. Judith is sensuous, strong and intriguing. She&amp;#039;s also a divorcÃƒÂ©e with a 6-year-old daughter. So Zaza has kept Judith a secret from his family. He will have to choose between respect of the strict confines of family and tradition, or the love of his life.\n\nFile Size (in bytes): \t\t730,748,928\nRuntime: \t\t\t1:38:01\n\nVideo Codec: \t\t\tXViD\nFrame Size: \t\t\t560x336 (Aspect Ratio 1.667:1)\nFPS: \t\t\t\t23.976\nVideo Bitrate\t\t\t853kbps\nBits per Pixel:\t\t\t0.189\n\nAudio Codec:\t\t\t0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:\t\t\t48000Hz\nAudio Bitrate:\t\t\t132kbps VBR\nNumber of Audio streams:\t1\n\nSpoken Languages:\t\tGeorgian/Hebrew\n\nEnglish Subtitles at http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/93282/hatuna-meuheret-en\n\n\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
