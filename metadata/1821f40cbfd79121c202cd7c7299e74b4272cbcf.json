Onar (CRC, 2010).pdf\n\nISBN 978-1-4398-1508-3\n\nAlso called energy scavenging, energy harvesting captures, stores, and uses &quot;clean&quot; energy sources by employing interfaces, storage devices, and other units. Unlike conventional electric power generation systems, renewable energy harvesting does not use fossil fuels and the generation units can be decentralized, thereby significantly reducing transmission and distribution losses. But advanced technical methods must be developed to increase the efficiency of devices in harvesting energy from environmentally friendly, &quot;green&quot; resources and converting them into electrical energy.\n\nRecognizing this need, Energy Harvesting Solar, Wind, and Ocean Energy Conversion Systems describes various energy harvesting technologies, different topologies, and many types of power electronic interfaces for stand-alone utilization or grid connection of energy harvesting applications. Along with providing all the necessary concepts and theoretical background, the authors develop simulation models throughout the text to build a practical understanding of system analysis and modeling.\n\nWith a focus on solar energy, the first chapter discusses the I V characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) systems, PV models and equivalent circuits, sun tracking systems, maximum power point tracking systems, shading effects, and power electronic interfaces for grid-connected and stand-alone PV systems. It also presents sizing criteria for applications and modern solar energy applications, including residential, vehicular, naval, and space applications. The next chapter reviews different types of wind turbines and electrical machines as well as various power electronic interfaces. After explaining the energy generation technologies, optimal operation principles, and possible utilization techniques of ocean tidal energy harvesting, the book explores near- and offshore approaches for harvesting the kinetic and potential energy of ocean waves. It also describes the required absorber, turbine, and generator types, along with the power electronic interfaces for grid connection and commercialized ocean wave energy conversion applications. The final chapter deals with closed, open, and hybrid-cycle ocean thermal energy conversion systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1821f40cbfd79121c202cd7c7299e74b4272cbcf","amp;dn":"Energy+Harvesting+-+Solar%2C+Wind%2C+and+Ocean+Energy+Conversion+Sys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1821f40cbfd79121c202cd7c7299e74b4272cbcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,33,244,12,191,215,145,33,194,2,205,124,114,153,231,75,66,114,203,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
