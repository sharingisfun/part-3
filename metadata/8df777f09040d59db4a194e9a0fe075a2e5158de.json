Mainstream science, however, has supppressed these facts. Prejudices based on current scientific theory act as a &quot;knowledge filter,&quot; giving us a picture of prehistory that is largely incorrect.\n\nAbout the Author\nMichael A Cremo is a research associate of the Bhaktivedanta Institute specializing in the history and philosophy of science. His persistent investigations during the eight years of writing Forbidden Archeology documented a major scientific cover-up. Richard L. Thompson, founding member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, received his Ph.D. in mathematics form Cornell University.\n\nTable of Contents\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Foreword\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Introduction and Acknowledgments\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 1 THE SONG OF THE RED LION\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 2 INCISED AND BROKEN BONES: THEDAWN OF DECEPTION\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 3 EOLITHS\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 4 CRUDE PALEOLITHIC STONE TOOLS\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 5 ADVANCED PALEOLITHS AND NEOLITHS\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 6 ANOMALOUS HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 7 JAVA MAN\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 8 THE PILTDOWN SHOWDOWN\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 9 PEKING MAN AND OTHER FINDS IN CHINA\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 10 LIVING APE-MEN?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 11 ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW OUT OF AFRICA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df777f09040d59db4a194e9a0fe075a2e5158de","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Archeology+-+The+Hidden+History+of+the+Human+Race+%28gnv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df777f09040d59db4a194e9a0fe075a2e5158de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,247,119,240,144,64,213,157,180,161,148,233,160,254,7,90,46,81,88,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
