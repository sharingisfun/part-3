Gameplay is inspired by point-and-click adventure games (like the classic Monkey Island or King's Quest series, or more recently Telltale's Walking Dead series), but focused on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling rather than clever puzzles or challenges of skill.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run kentuckyroutezero_actiii_setup.exe and install the game;\n2) Start the game using main executable or shortcuts (DRM free).\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!\n\nwww.kentuckyroutezero.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46c0599e35f1efdfc2e81b8eccf930f9005ddc30","amp;dn":"Kentucky+Route+Zero+Act+III","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46c0599e35f1efdfc2e81b8eccf930f9005ddc30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,192,89,158,53,241,239,223,194,232,27,142,204,249,48,249,0,93,220,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
