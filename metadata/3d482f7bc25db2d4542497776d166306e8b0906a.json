It follows up Mineo's 2011 mixtape Formerly Known. Considered one of the most anticipated Christian hip hop albums of 2013, and one of the most anticipated debuts ever within the genre, Heroes for Sale includes features from Lecrae, Trip Lee, KB, Christon Gray, and Krizz Kaliko, among others. Three singles were released for the album, &quot;AYO!&quot; on January 28, 2013, &quot;Bitter&quot; on March 5, 2013, and &quot;You Will&quot; on April 2, 2013. A music video for &quot;AYO!&quot; came out on January 31, a three-part webseries was launched on February 6, and a documentary entitled &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; was released on April 9. Lyrically, Mineo based the album concept around the brokenness of human heroes, and the album has a very transparent and personal tone. Stylistically, it mixes hip hop music with a variety of influences, including hymns, reggaeton, jazz, heavy metal, and classical.\n\nRelease Date: April 16, 2013\n\nTrack List:\n1.\t&quot;Superhuman&quot;  \t\t\n2.\t&quot;Ex Nihilo&quot; \n3.\t&quot;AYO!&quot;  \t\n4.\t&quot;You Will&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;The Saints&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Caught Dreaming&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Bitter&quot;  \t\n8.\t&quot;Shallow&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Wild Things&quot;  \t\n10.\t&quot;Take Me Alive&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Uno Uno Seis&quot; \n12.\t&quot;Cocky&quot;  \t\n13.\t&quot;Curious&quot;  \t\n14.\t&quot;Still Bleeding&quot; \n15.\t&quot;Tug Of War&quot; \n16.\t&quot;Death Has Died&quot;  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d482f7bc25db2d4542497776d166306e8b0906a","amp;dn":"Andy+Mineo%3A+Heroes+for+Sale%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d482f7bc25db2d4542497776d166306e8b0906a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,72,47,123,194,93,178,212,84,36,151,119,109,22,99,6,232,176,144,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
