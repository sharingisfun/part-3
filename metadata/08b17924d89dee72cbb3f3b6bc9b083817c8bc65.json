It takes the\nbulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights,\noffering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the\nthrilling &quot;one shot, one kill&quot; precision that made the original a huge\nhit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced\ncapabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers\nstriking graphic environments.\n\n\nFeatures:\n=========\n* Motion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the\nplayer touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in\nreal-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the\npad's trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more\naccurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the\ntarget and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.\n* Realistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the\nrealism of its shooting dynamics. Wind speed, distance, gravity and\nbullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.\n* Refined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your\nheart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your\nround, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head.\nFrom acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper\nmust pull together everything to achieve the ideal &quot;one shot; one kill.&quot;\n* Improved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was\ncompletely re-tooled and designed from scratch. Much of the improvements\nwere made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything\nfrom flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage\nyou in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.\n* New Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban\nenvironments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along\nwith jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever.\n* Various Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible\nto the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty\nlevels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to\nplay - either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and\nexperience the game on Expert Mode.\n* Bullet-Cam: everyone's favorite feature returns to reward expert shots\nand show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the\ntransfer of kinetic energy - a bullet's true stopping power - can do to\nthe enemy from 1000 meters or more!\n* Bullet Penetration: concealment doesn't necessarily mean cover. In\nSniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and\nare able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You\ncan also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an\nentire squad. Wait 'til you see that on Bullet Cam!\n* Expanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the world's most advanced sniper\nrifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately\nsimulate the modern weaponry found on today's battlefields.\n* New Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night\nvision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating\nthe enemy before they spot you.\n\n\nInstallation Information:\n=========================\n\n* Burn or mount\n* Install\n* Play the game\n\nNOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b17924d89dee72cbb3f3b6bc9b083817c8bc65","amp;dn":"Sniper_Ghost_Warrior_2-FLT.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b17924d89dee72cbb3f3b6bc9b083817c8bc65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,177,121,36,216,157,238,114,203,179,243,182,188,155,8,56,23,200,188,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
