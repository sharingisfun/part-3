They play a musical hybrid of 1960s garage rock and 1990s alternative music. Until 2011, their line-up consisted of vocalist and lead guitarist Craig Nicholls, rhythm guitarist Ryan Griffiths, bass guitarist Brad Heald, and drummer Hamish Rosser. In December 2011, Channel [V] presenter Jane Gazzo confirmed via Twitter that Griffiths and Rosser had been &quot;sacked&quot; from the band.[1]\n\nThe Vines' success in the Australian recording industry resulted in winning an ARIA Award in 2002 for 'Breakthrough Artist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Single' for &quot;Get Free&quot;, and receiving five other nominations for their debut album Highly Evolved, plus two further nominations in subsequent years. In 2003, the album went double platinum in Australia,[citation needed] and since then the band has released four albums and a best-of compilation from their time at Capitol Records. Their fifth album and newest release titled Future Primitive was released on 3 June 2011 in Australia with worldwide release dates to be announced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best Of 2008\n\n\n\nThe Best of The Vines is a compilation album by The Vines and contains a selection of singles and album tracks from their first three albums released under Capitol Records. The band did not have a say in the release having been dropped by Capitol Records in 2007, however they picked the songs.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Get Free&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Ride&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Highly Evolved&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Winning Days&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Outtathaway&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Autumn Shade&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Autumn Shade II&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Factory&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Animal Machine&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Don't Listen to the Radio&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Vision Valley&quot; \n12.\t&quot;Homesick&quot; \n13.\t&quot;Fuck the World&quot; \n14.\t&quot;Spaceship&quot; \n15.\t&quot;Anysound&quot; \n16.\t&quot;Sun Child&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63e05f47fd7283b4f9df178a8fb34cfac0aa8559","amp;dn":"The+Vines+-+The+Best+Of+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2008+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63e05f47fd7283b4f9df178a8fb34cfac0aa8559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,224,95,71,253,114,131,180,249,223,23,138,143,179,76,250,192,170,133,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
