The first step to revive a waning sex life or make a healthy one more fulfilling, says author Diana Richardson, is to make sex a conscious decision rather than an accidental encounter. Focusing on eye contact, subtle sensations, and deep breathing, DianaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s practice of slow sex awakens the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innate mechanism for ecstasy, unlocking the door to extraordinary realms of sensitivity, sensuality, and higher consciousness.\n\n Exploring the healing, spiritual power of slow sex, this book offers a step-by-step guide for committed couples to transform sex into a meditative, loving union of complementary energies. It explains how slow sex increases sensitivity and sexual vitality and how, because it creates and restores love, slow sex is loving sex. With a focus on coolness rather than heat, this practice provides couples a way to reach a shared meditative state and use it as a vehicle to achieve higher consciousness. Illustrating different positions for eye contact, deep sustained penetration, and soft penetration, this book reveals that sex truly can be sustainable and enjoyable well into old age.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa22688a748b74186544e29bb8fc337318829d6","amp;dn":"Slow+Sex%3A+The+Path+to+Fulfilling+and+Sustainable+Sexuality+-Mant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa22688a748b74186544e29bb8fc337318829d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,162,38,136,167,72,183,65,134,84,78,41,187,143,195,55,49,136,41,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
