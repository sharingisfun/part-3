The game has been patched to 2.0.1 along with the Direct3D patch.\n\n\n\nTo get it running, simply follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the Outlaws.rar to desired location\n2. Mount the ccd-file from the CD 1 folder\n3. Run olwin.exe to start the game\n\nRun olcfg.exe to configure resolution and basic graphics options.\n\n\nNOTE! You should run both olwin.exe and olcfg.exe in WindowsXP SP3 \ncompatability mode for them to work properly.\n\n\n\nThe LecD3d.dll file was causing problems and has been swapped with a modified one. I've included the original as LecD3d BACKUP.dll, just in case.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72d345e9ae3adc09365475653b5546158dc22e4c","amp;dn":"LucasArts+Outlaws+%281997%29+-+Pre-installed+for+Win7+%2F+Win8.1+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72d345e9ae3adc09365475653b5546158dc22e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,211,69,233,174,58,220,9,54,84,117,101,59,85,70,21,141,194,46,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
