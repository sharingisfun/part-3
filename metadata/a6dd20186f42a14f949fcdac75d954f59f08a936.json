These gardens provide tranquil settings where visitors can shed the burdens and stresses of modern existence, satisfy an age-old yearning for solitude and repose, and experience the restorative power of art and nature. For this reason the value of the Japanese stone garden today is arguably even greater than when many of them were created.\n\nJapanese Stone Gardens provides a comprehensive introduction to the powerful mystique and dynamism of the Japanese stone gardenÃ¢â‚¬â€from their earliest use as props in animistic rituals, to their appropriation by Zen monks and priests to create settings conducive to contemplation and finally to their contemporary uses and meaning. With insightful text and abundant imagery, this book reveals the hidden order of stone gardens and in the process heightens the enthusiast's appreciation of them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6dd20186f42a14f949fcdac75d954f59f08a936","amp;dn":"Japanese+Stone+Gardens+Origins%2C+Meaning%2C+Form+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6dd20186f42a14f949fcdac75d954f59f08a936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,221,32,24,111,66,161,79,148,159,205,172,117,217,84,245,159,8,169,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
