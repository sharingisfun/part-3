He is best known for his science fiction, notably his satirical dystopian novel WAR WITH THE NEWTS (1936) and the play R.U.R. (1920) that introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; to the English language and gave the genre one of its most enduring tropes.  He is comparable with Aldous Huxley and George Orwell as a speculative fiction writer, distinguishing his work from genre-specific hard science fiction.\n\nIn addition to several short story collections in this torrent, TOWARD THE RADICAL CENTER provides a generous selection of Ã„Å’apek's best plays, stories, columns, essays, and travel writing.\n\nArthur Miller wrote in 1990: &quot;I read Karel Ã„Å’apek for the first time when I was a college student long ago in the Thirties.  There was no writer like him . . . prophetic assurance mixed with surrealistic humour and hard-edged social satire: a unique combination . . . he is a joy to read.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* APOCRYPHAL TALES (Catbird Press, 1997).
