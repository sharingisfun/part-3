After watching it, it became my best TV show too.\nThe first time I saw it, it was a crappy dvd/tv rip (it was the best quality you could find out there at the time). The Wire is already a bit hard to watch (4/3, not a lot of post-prod/special effects...), and it appears that the quality of popular torrents of The Wire is still the same :(\n\nSo here's the best quality you can find of the TV show The Wire. The only way to get a better quality is to go and buy the DVD/CDs...\n\nIn this pack you'll find the TV shows (5 seasons), the sequel (3 mini-episodes) and the extras. All the shows contains english subtitles and audio commentary. Everything is encoded with x264 codec.\n\nThere is also a 720p version of the first episode. There will be no other episode in 720p. You can read more about it here &lt;a href=&quot; http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/inside-hbos-the-wire&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/inside-hbos-the-wire&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe pack contains also the OST. There is a 320kbps MP3 and a FLAC version. Not the crappy one you can find out there.\n\nHere the screenshots for the show:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgur.com/a/bWUcf#9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgur.com/a/bWUcf#9&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe mediainfo and the log:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebin.com/ZWvnL8BZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebin.com/ZWvnL8BZ&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebin.com/VkGLLhmA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebin.com/VkGLLhmA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease help us seed (even just an episode or the OST) and make it popular for anyone who search The Wire find the good quality rips. \n\n\nNB: Torrent is server seeded for a few months (1GB/s)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d871df60c20d166970183e24d9816c934ba3cc1","amp;dn":"The+Wire+-+Ultimate+Box+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d871df60c20d166970183e24d9816c934ba3cc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,135,29,246,12,32,209,102,151,1,131,226,77,152,22,201,52,186,60,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
