Working with well known 747 Captains and Engineers, the iFly team captured the &quot;Queen of The Skies&quot; like never before. High accuracy simulation of cockpit and systems and a full load of features make this a premier expansion to Microsoft Flight Simulator X. The product was tested by real 747 pilots to help maintain the accuracy required for this simulation.\n\nFMS:\n- Winds aloft forecast entries.\n- Conditional waypoints for SIDS/STARS/Approaches.\n- Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints for SIDS/STARS/Approaches.\n- Accurate Cost Index calculations for ECON/LRC speeds\n- Horizontal and vertical navigation.\n- User defined waypoints.\n- SID/STAR and navdata custom database.\n- ETA and Fuel prediction.\n- All pages and menus are implemented.\n- CRT/LCD\n- Maintenance pages.\n\nAutopilot:\n- Realistic Autopilot Flight Director System (AFDS) with Autothrottle System.\n- AFDS active (Display in green): FD, CMD, LAND3, TEST\n(Displays in green with white triangles): LAND2\n(Displays in amber): NO AUTOLAND\n- Autothrottle (A/T) Active (Display in Green) Modes: THR, THRREF, HOLD, IDLE, SPD\n- AFDS active Roll Modes Display in green): HDGHOLD, HDGSEL, LNAV, LOC, ROLLOUT, TO/GA\n- AFDS armed Roll Modes (Display in white): LOC, ROLLOUT, LNAV\n- AFDS active Pitch Modes (Display in green): TO/GA, ALT, V/S, VNAVPTH, VNAVSPD, VNAVALT, G/S, FLARE, FLCHSPD\n- AFDS armed Pitch Modes (Display in white): G/S, FLARE, VNAV\n- Leg Types: Track to Fix, Direct to Fix, Arc to Fix, Course to Fix, Radius to Fix\n- With left and right Flight Director.\n- Cross-bar or single cue flight director.\n- Three individual flight control computers (FCCs).\n- Simulated AFDS Status Annunciation.\n- Activation of mouse wheel for easier MCP window settings.\n\nExterior Model:\n- 3DS Max Model\n- Realistic control surfaces.\n- Working elevator power.\n- Realistic flight spoilers and ground spoilers.\n- Nozzle valve animation.\n- Working APU doors.\n- Entry &amp; cargo doors with corresponding cockpit light.\n- High quality livery textures.\n- Flex wing.\n\nVirtual Cockpit:\n- High Quality 3D modeling\n- High Definition textures\n- Gauges functional, clickable and animated\n- Animated windows Wipers (two speeds) and more.\n- Superb instrument lightning at night.\n- Windshield reflection.\n\nSystems:\n- Simulated triple Inertial Reference System.\n- Terrain Display\n- NAV1/2 radios with working AUTO/MAN modes.\n- Realistic Ground Proximity Warning System.\n- Cabin pressurization logic fully implemented.\n- Flap load relief protection.\n- Failures.\n- Aural alerts.\n- Simulation of Left and Right EFIS.\n- Full TCAS logic (with traffic display on EHSI)\n- Weather Radar (Active Sky Next Required)\n- Predictive Winshear (Active Sky Next Required)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n- CRT and LCD Display units\n- Interactive Configuration Manager.\n- Many custom configuration options.\n- Detailed tutorial and operating manual\n- Aircraft performance calculated directly from flight model parameters.\n- With custom Turbine Sound Studios GE, RR, PW sound packages\n- More than 44500 SIDs/STARs included.\n- Ground support and push back.\n- 2D Panel supports both standard and widescreen monitors.\n- Hundreds of programmable key assignments\n- Ability to operate both Captain and First officer`s instrumentation in different modes while in 2D and in the virtual cockpit.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/79SbeAbNDcs/maxresdefault.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/79SbeAbNDcs/maxresdefault.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9d7742162173fe84456b36ac7c2d38a495d1ed2","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+iFly+Boeing+747-400+V2+for+FSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9d7742162173fe84456b36ac7c2d38a495d1ed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,215,116,33,98,23,63,232,68,86,179,106,199,194,211,138,73,93,30,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
