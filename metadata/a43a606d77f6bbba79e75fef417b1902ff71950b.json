The tale of youths in a motorcycle gang growing up as delinquents in the shadow of war that consumed thier world decades prior.  Twisting fates await them as they toil away in the streets they call home.\n\n   Sorry I cant say much because I hate to spoil anything, but if you dont know about Akira, or saw the anime but havent read this jump on the opportunity because this is a work of art in many more ways than two.  Its a classic by all standards, and this RAR file contains all 6 volumes.  Its the black and white version which means its complete.  There are some pages in full color though which is cool.  Dark Horse released a full color version but since comics are regulated due to the cost of making color copies with higher grade paper to print them upon, its abridged.  So before you go read those copies read these or youll miss out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43a606d77f6bbba79e75fef417b1902ff71950b","amp;dn":"Akira+Complete+Manga+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43a606d77f6bbba79e75fef417b1902ff71950b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,58,96,109,119,246,187,186,121,231,95,239,65,123,25,2,255,113,149,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
