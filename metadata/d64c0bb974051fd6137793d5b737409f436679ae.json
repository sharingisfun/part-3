After moving in, they learn that the house has historical architectural importance and is valued in the millions. However, they are constantly tormented by a mouse within the walls. They engage in cartoon-like combat against the rodent, but it manages to outwit the brothers in successive situations. Both live and animatronic mice portray the title role, and some scenes assume the mouse's point of view. The film is dedicated to William Hickey. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 38 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 640\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 114kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64c0bb974051fd6137793d5b737409f436679ae","amp;dn":"Mouse+Hunt%281997%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64c0bb974051fd6137793d5b737409f436679ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,76,11,185,116,5,31,214,19,119,147,213,183,55,64,159,67,102,121,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
