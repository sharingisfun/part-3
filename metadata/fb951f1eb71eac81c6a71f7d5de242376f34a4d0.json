Wallbanger [Cocktail, #1] - Alice Clayton\n\n\n\nCaroline Reynolds has a fantastic new apartment in San Francisco, a KitchenAid mixer, and no O (and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not talking Oprah here, folks). She has a flourishing design career, an office overlooking the bay, a killer zucchini bread recipe, and no O. She has Clive (the best cat ever), great friends, a great rack, and no O.\n\nAdding insult to O-less, since her move, she has an oversexed neighbor with the loudest late-night wallbanging sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever heard. Each moan, spank, andÃ¢â‚¬â€œwas that a meow?Ã¢â‚¬â€œpunctuates the fact that not only is she losing sleep, she still has, yep, you guessed it, no O.\n\nEnter Simon Parker. (No, really, Simon, please enter.) When the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. Their late-night hallway encounter has, well, mixed results. Ahem. With walls this thin, the tensionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna be thickÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nIn her third novel, Alice Clayton returns to dish her trademark mix of silly and steamy. Banter, barbs, and strutting pussycats, plus the sexiest apple pie ever made, are dunked in a hot tub and set against the gorgeous San Francisco skyline in this hot and hilarious tale of exasperation at first sight.\n\n02. Rusty Nailed [Cocktail, #2] - Alice Clayton\n\n\n\nIn this sequel to Wallbanger, fan favorites Caroline Reynolds and Simon Parker negotiate the rollercoaster of their new relationship while house-sitting in Sausalito.\n\nPlaying house was never so much funÃ¢â‚¬â€or so confusing. With her boss on an extended honeymoon, CarolineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s working crazy-long hours to keep the interior design company runningÃ¢â‚¬â€especially since sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the lead designer for the renovation of a gorgeous old hotel. And with Simon, her hotshot photographer boyfriend, gallivanting all over the world for his job, the couple is heavy-duty into &quot;absence makes the heart grow fonder&quot; mode. No complaints about the great reunion sex, though!\n\nThen a trip back east to his childhood home has Simon questioning his nomadic lifestyle. He decides to be home more. A lot more. And he wants Caroline home more, too. Though their friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ romantic lives provide plenty of welcome distraction, eventually Caroline and Simon have to sort out their relationship. Sure, more togetherness is a good thingÃ¢â‚¬â€but does less traveling and working have to mean the other extreme? Apple pie and picket fences? With this second book in the Cocktail series, USA TODAY bestselling author Alice Clayton delivers another delicious, frothy confection of a book, shaking up her characters, stirring in laugh-out-loud humor, and serving sizzling romance straight up!\n\n03. Screwdrivered [Cocktail, #3] - Alice Clayton\n\n\n\nReaders back for a third round of the bestselling Cocktail series will enjoy a madcap romantic comedy about bodice ripping and chest heaving, fiery passion and love everlasting. Plus a dash of paperwork filing and horseshiÃ¢â‚¬â€wait, what?\n\nBy day, Viv Franklin is a tough-as-nails software engineer who designs programs and loves hospital corners. By night, VivianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a secret romance-novel junkie who longs for a knight in shining armor, or a cowboy on a wild stallion, or a strapping firefighter to sweep her off her feet. And she gets to wear the bodiceÃ¢â‚¬â€donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget the bodice.\n\nWhen a phone call brings news that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inherited a beautiful old home in Mendocino, California from a long-forgotten aunt, she moves her entire life across the country to embark on what she sees as a great, romance-novel-worthy adventure. But romance novels always have a twist, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they?\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a cowboy, one that ignites her loins. Because Cowboy Hank is totally loin-ignition worthy. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a librarian, Clark Barrow. And he calls her Vivian. Can tweed jackets and elbow patches compete with chaps and spurs? You bet your sweet cow pie.\n\nIn Screwdrivered, Alice Clayton pits Superman against Clark in a hilarious and hot battle that delights a swooning Viv/Vivian. Also within this book, an answer to the question of the ages: Why ride a cowboy when you can ride a librarian?\n\n04. Mai Tai'd Up [Cocktail, #4] - Alice Clayton\n\n\n\nLooking for the perfect mix of smart, sexy, and sassy? Mai TaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d Up continues New York Times bestselling author Alice ClaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cocktail series, which began with Wallbanger and continued with Rusty Nailed and Screwdrivered.\n\nThe gossip mill in the seaside community of Monterey is churning about Chloe Patterson, the newcomer who is starting a sanctuary for rescued pit bulls. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rumored that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a former beauty queen (true) who ditched her fiancÃƒÂ© the morning of their wedding (also true). And that while sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not looking for a new man, the good-looking local veterinarian has his eye on her. Absolutely, positively true.\n\nWhen Lucas Campbell isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t at the family veterinary clinic, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paddle boarding in Monterey Bay. Recently single, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely not in the market for a new relationship, but he still canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist taking a second, third, and fourth look at the recent arrival of Miss Golden State.\n\nNeither Lucas nor Chloe has any interest in being tied down. Being tied up, howeverÃ¢â‚¬â€now thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a thought. But are a few Mai Tais, a moonlit night, and the music of Frank Sinatra enough to allow them both to forget their past? LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope OlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Blue Eyes knows what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing.\n\nMix one part tiki, one part kinky, and a splash of old black magic matchmaking, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to be . . .
