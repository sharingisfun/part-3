The bass player was a classically trained violinist, and the frontman, Tommy Hall, majored in chemical engineering and psychology at U. Texas (and claimed to have been involved in government LSD experiments). He played an &quot;electric jug,&quot; which sounded something like a Moog synthesizer. Many of the band members came to a bad end, one of them ending up like Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett. &quot;But Captain K,&quot; you may ask, &quot;What did they sound like?&quot; Raw. Primitive. Weird. Jarring. Ahead-of-their-time bizarro sound effects. One hears foretastes of the ambient noise of Brian Eno, or the &quot;shoegazer&quot; noise-rock groups from twenty years later. This is a good compilation and probably all you could want or need..\nReview CD Universe - Very Best of the 13th Floor Elevators: Going Up album for sale Product Description  Very Best of the 13th Floor Elevators: Going Up album for sale by 13th Floor Elevators was released Jun 21, 2005 on the Snapper label.
