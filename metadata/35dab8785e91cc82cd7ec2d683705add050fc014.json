When his wife needs money for dental treatment, Manny goes to the local insurance office to borrow on her policy. Employees at the office mistake him for a hold-up man who robbed them the year before and the police are called. The film tells the true story of what happened to Manny and his family.\n\nThe true story of Manny Balestrero, a musician unjustly accused of armed robbery. In classic Hitchcock form, Balestrero vehemently protests his innocence but acts thoroughly guilty, leading a host of policemen and witnesses to finger him as the thief. The trial goes badly for Manny, but life is worse for his wife, Rose, who falls apart under the strain of his ordeal.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : Z:SeedboxThe wrong man 1956the.wrong.man.1956.dvdrip.xvid.fragment.avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 698 MiB\nDuration : 1h 45mn\nOverall bit rate : 925 Kbps\nWriting application : Nandub v1.0rc2\nWriting library : Nandub build 1852/release\n\nVideo\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 45mn\nBit rate : 820 Kbps\nWidth : 528 pixels\nHeight : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.225\nStream size : 619 MiB (89%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.0.1 (UTC 2004-06-05)\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 45mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 32.0 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 1 channel\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\nStream size : 69.6 MiB (10%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 480 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.93UUUUUULAME3.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35dab8785e91cc82cd7ec2d683705add050fc014","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock+-+The+wrong+man+%5B1956%5D+%5BENG%2FFRA%2FESP+Subtitles%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35dab8785e91cc82cd7ec2d683705add050fc014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,218,184,120,94,145,204,130,205,126,194,214,131,112,90,221,5,15,192,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
