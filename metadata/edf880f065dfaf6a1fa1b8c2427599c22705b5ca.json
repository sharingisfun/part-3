Major Lazer's brain-trust (Diplo and Switch), partner with them to bring the newest mixtape that was put together while on a recent trip to Jamaica.\n\nLazerproof plays on both groups' styles and the result is a project that is only vaguely recognizable as the sum of its parts -- ska, dubstep, hip-hop and pop stars aligning to create a synth-Britania meets dubstep dancehall gem.\n\nThe 14-track tape boasts guest appearances from Gucci Mane, Drake, Gyptian, Rusko and Amanda Blank add the infamous Mad Decent touch.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist\n_________________________________\n\n\n1.Bulletproof (Nacey Remix ft.
