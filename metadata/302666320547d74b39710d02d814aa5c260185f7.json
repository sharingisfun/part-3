Atlantic took some chances with Walker, dispatching him to Chicago for a 1955 date with Junior Wells and Jimmy Rogers that produced 'Why Not' and 'Papa Ain't Salty.' Even better were the 1956-1957 L.A. dates that produced the scalding instrumental 'Two Bones and a Pick' (which finds Walker duelling it out with nephew R.S. Rankin and jazzman Barney Kessel). \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302666320547d74b39710d02d814aa5c260185f7","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+T-Bone+Walker+-+T-Bone+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302666320547d74b39710d02d814aa5c260185f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,38,102,50,5,71,215,75,57,113,13,2,216,20,170,92,38,1,133,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
