Unfortunately, prevailing attitudes about male sexuality and what is good sex work against these innate features by focusing on the excitement of ejaculation as the one and only goal.\n\nUsing the tantric guidelines they have practiced for more than 25 years, Diana and Michael Richardson show men how to move beyond their preconceptions of sex as a goal-oriented--and often unintentionally stressful--event so they can relax into sex as a meditative union of complementary energies. They explain how retaining semen allows for increased vitality and extended lovemaking sessions and show the relationship-strengthening benefits of deep, sustained penetration. They also explain how to perform soft penetration and how to avoid premature ejaculation.\n\nTantric Sex for Men includes tried-and-true foreplay approaches, diagrams of sexual position sequences, ways to increase sexual sensitivity through awareness, and how to have ecstatic experiences through reaching a womanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s body on a sexually deeper level. The authors also demonstrate how the sexual organs can be used to heal both men and women physically, emotionally, and spiritually.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909a8b15c63057b0f3642129f2494ae635d42136","amp;dn":"Tantric+Sex+for+Men%2C+Making+Love+a+Meditation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909a8b15c63057b0f3642129f2494ae635d42136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,154,139,21,198,48,87,176,243,100,33,41,242,73,74,230,53,212,33,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
