What happened was, the original torrents for these episodes are not only almost dead, they don't work too well. They would play for a few minutes, then quit. I fixed them by re-encoding them and re-muxing the audio and subtitles. The format itself is MKV, encoded with H.264 and AC3. Japanese and English audio, Japanese by default. The subtitles are in English, on by default, but can be disabled. I recommend using VLC media player, unless you have a better one for playing MKV with AC3 audio. Yes, it is a big upload, because breaking them up into multiple torrents ensures that some of them will die due to not enough seeders. This is my first torrent, so let me know if something goes wrong. \n\nAs always, please seed after you download, I really want this to keep going, but don't have the bandwidth to seed 24/7. With that said, enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec9ba68feeaed5f5dc4b60c393f84ba228ff73a5","amp;dn":"Serial+Experiments+Lain+Complete+H.264%2FAC3+Jap%2FEng+Audio+Eng+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec9ba68feeaed5f5dc4b60c393f84ba228ff73a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,155,166,143,238,174,213,245,220,75,96,195,147,248,75,162,40,255,115,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
