But her new BFF isn't kidding about the &quot;Forever&quot; part...\n\nOf all the things Anya expected to find at the bottom of an old well, a new friend was not one of them. Especially not a new friend who's been dead for a century.\n\nFalling down a well is bad enough, but Anya's normal life might actually be worse. She's embarrassed by her family, self-conscious about her body, and she's pretty much given up on fitting in at school. A new friend - even a ghost - is just what she needs.\n\nOr so she thinks.\n\nSpooky, sardonic, and secretly sincere, Anya's Ghost is a wonderfully entertaining debut from author/artist Vera Brosgol.\n \nAnya's Ghost is a 2011 Kirkus Best Teen Books of the Year title.\nOne of School Library Journal's Best Fiction Books of 2011.\nOne of Horn Book's Best Fiction Books of 2011.\nWinner of the 2012 Eisner Award for Best Publication for Young Adults (Ages 12-17)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f0b2b04cfcd6fa91afedd26930ef135daa948a","amp;dn":"Vera+Brosgol+-+Anya%27s+Ghost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f0b2b04cfcd6fa91afedd26930ef135daa948a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,240,178,176,76,252,214,250,145,175,237,210,105,48,239,19,93,170,148,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
