Scores have been killed on the streets of Bangkok. Freedom of speech is routinely denied. Democracy appears increasingly distant. And many Thais fear that the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej is expected to unleash even greater instability.\n\nYet in spite of the impact of the crisis, and the extraordinary importance of the royal succession, they have never been comprehensively analyzed - until now. Breaking Thailand's draconian lÃƒÂ¨se majestÃƒÂ© law, Andrew MacGregor Marshall is one of the only journalists covering contemporary Thailand to tell the whole story. He provides a comprehensive explanation that for the first time makes sense of the crisis, revealing the unacknowledged succession conflict that has become entangled with the struggle for democracy in Thailand","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed900a9def727230b526f49229d4b669c7ef0b13","amp;dn":"A+Kingdom+in+Crisis+%28Andrew+MacGregor+Marshall%29+PDF+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed900a9def727230b526f49229d4b669c7ef0b13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,144,10,157,239,114,114,48,181,38,244,146,41,212,182,105,199,239,11,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
