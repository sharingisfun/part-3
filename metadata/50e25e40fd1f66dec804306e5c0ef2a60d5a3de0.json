This course helps you make your webpages more responsive to different screen sizes with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Picking up where he left off in Creating a Responsive Web Design, Chris Converse shows how to modify your existing HTML, dynamically load content, animate elements on the page, and collapse the navigation on smaller screensÃ¢â‚¬â€while allowing users to expand menus with a tap of their finger.\n\nNote: This course uses the jQuery JavaScript library to add interactivity and other features to the example site. But if you've never written JavaScript before, don't worry. This course provides a step-by-step approach to writing just the code you need to replicate the experience Chris shows on screen.\nTopics include:\n\n    Modifying the graphics\n    Adjusting the CSS for the navigation\n    Adding JavaScript and jQuery to your project\n    Loading content with jQuery\n    Determining screen size with JavaScript\n    Loading alternate content based on screen size\n    Animating the hero panel\n    Maintaining support for Internet Explorer 7 and 8\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50e25e40fd1f66dec804306e5c0ef2a60d5a3de0","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Creating+a+Responsive+Web+Experience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50e25e40fd1f66dec804306e5c0ef2a60d5a3de0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,226,94,64,253,31,102,222,200,4,48,110,92,14,242,166,13,90,61,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
