Once you are      \n              registered with the Email Tracker service and the   \n              campaign name is created in AMS, our system         \n              starts monitoring the status of every email sent    \n              out under that email campaign name.                 \n                                                                  \n              Our mailer supports mailing lists stored in the     \n              formats of text files (.txt or .lst) or CSV files   \n              exported from Microsoft Excel, Word or Access.      \n                                                                  \n              Atomic Mail Sender provides basic mailing list      \n              management options: adding new addresses,           \n              removing addresses, filtering, unsubscribing,       \n              etc. Combined together with Atomic Subscription     \n              Manager, the two software applications automate     \n              the entire process of addresses management. You     \n              do not have to add or remove users manually anymore!\n                                                                  \n              Being a stand-alone fast and safe mass emailer,     \n              the program does not require any additional         \n              components to be installed (for example, some       \n              widely known bulk mailers use Internet Explorer     \n              and Front Page extensions to compose HTML emails,   \n              which does not make them fully compatible with      \n              all computers and requires spending additional      \n              money). All you need is a connection to the         \n              Internet.                                           \n                                                                  \n              Atomic Mail Sender has a built-in SMTP server       \n              that delivers all email messages directly to        \n              their recipients without using your ISP's mailbox   \n              or mail server (if your provider permits).          \n              Actually, it establishes a connection, imitates a   \n              mail server and puts messages to mailboxes. This    \n              trick saves your time and makes sending e-mails     \n              in bulk really safe and fast!                       \n                                                                  \n              The number of addresses in mailing lists is not     \n              limited. You can send emails to a million people    \n              if you have such a huge address list. Simply        \n              start the program, load your mailing list and       \n              press 'Start' to begin working!

You can send hundreds of emails a       \n              minute (the actual rate may depend on the size of   \n              messages and the sizes of attached files and        \n              embedded images).                                   \n                                                                  \n              Atomic Mail Sender is a unique program for          \n              sending mass email. The program provides safe,      \n              easy and fast way for direct mail sending. It       \n              reduces delivery time by sending several messages   \n              simultaneously so if you have a broadband           \n              Internet connection, you can increase the number    \n              of threads and send mail faster!                    \n                                                                  \n              AMS is a powerful tool for personalized mass        \n              mailing that supports email merging.
