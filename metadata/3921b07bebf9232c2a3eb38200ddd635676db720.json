He was certainly the most versatile. The director of the masterpieces Battleship Potemkin and Alexander Nevsky, Eisenstein also wrote ground-breaking essays on film art and taught classes on motion picture production. In this book Eisenstein writes about film directing.\n\nP.S. \nIt's a scanned pdf so the quality is not the best, but it is highly recommended for anybody interested in films in any capacity. A real treasure from the original master.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3921b07bebf9232c2a3eb38200ddd635676db720","amp;dn":"Problems+of+Film+Direction+-+Sergei+Eisenstein.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3921b07bebf9232c2a3eb38200ddd635676db720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,33,176,123,235,249,35,44,42,62,179,130,0,221,214,53,103,109,183,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
