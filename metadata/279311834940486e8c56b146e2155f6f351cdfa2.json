The group consists of Black Francis (vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), Kim Deal (bass, vocals), and David Lovering (drums). While the Pixies found only modest success in their home country, they were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. The group disbanded in 1993 in acrimonious circumstances but reunited in 2004.\n\nThe band's style of music contains elements including indie rock and surf rock. Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer who has been noted for his yowling delivery. He has typically written about offbeat subjects, such as extraterrestrials, surrealism and biblical violence.\n\nThe group has been described as a big influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain's acknowledgment of the debt his band Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, helped the Pixies' legacy and popularity grow in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out tours following their reunion in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome On Pilgrim 1987\n\n\nCome On Pilgrim is the debut mini-LP release by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in September 1987 by 4AD.\n\nIn March 1987, the Pixies (Black Francis, guitar/lead vocals; Kim Deal, bass/vocals; Joey Santiago, guitar; David Lovering, drums), entered Boston's Fort Apache Studios with Fort Apache owner/record producer Gary Smith to record a demo tape. The resulting 17-song cassette, later dubbed &quot;The Purple Tape&quot; eventually found its way to Ivo Watts-Russell, president and co-founder of the influential British record label 4AD. The Pixies' manager, Ken Goes, was also the manager of Throwing Muses, who had become the first American band to sign to 4AD a year earlier. Despite being initially unimpressed by the demo, Watts-Russell was urged to sign the band by his girlfriend, a secretary for 4AD. After her insistence, he walked the streets of New York listening to The Purple Tape on his Walkman and, in his words, finally &quot;got it.&quot;\n\nWatts-Russell hand-picked eight of The Purple Tape's 17 songs to make up a debut &quot;mini album.&quot; Expressing regret that some previous 4AD debuts failed to live up the power of their demo versions, he decided to slightly re-mix eight of The Purple Tape's 17 songs for release, rather than have the band re-record the songs. The Pixies later re-recorded and included eight of the nine remaining Purple Tape tracks over the course of their albums and EP releases. The only song not to be re-recorded and released was &quot;Rock A My Soul.&quot; This, along with the rest of the nine &quot;missing&quot; Purple Tape tracks were released as Pixies by the Canadian label Sonic Unyon in 2002.\n\nThe title of the album derives from Christian rock singer Larry Norman, whose catchphrase was &quot;Come on pilgrim, you know He loves you&quot;,[3] which was used as a lyric in the song &quot;Levitate Me&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Caribou&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n2.\t&quot;Vamos&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n3.\t&quot;Isla de Encanta&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:41\n4.\t&quot;Ed Is Dead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n5.\t&quot;The Holiday Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:14\n6.\t&quot;Nimrod's Son&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n7.\t&quot;I've Been Tired&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n8.\t&quot;Levitate Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurfer Rosa 1988\n\n\nSurfer Rosa is the first full-length album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in March 1988 on the British independent record label 4AD.[2] The album's unusual and offbeat subject matter includes references to mutilation and voyeurism; this is augmented by experimental recording, low-fidelity production and a distinctive drum sound. Surfer Rosa contains many of the themes present in the Pixies' earlier output, including Spanish lyrics and references to Puerto Rico.\n\nBecause of 4AD's independent status, distribution in the United States was handled by British label Rough Trade Records; however, it failed to chart in either the UK or the U.S. &quot;Gigantic&quot; was the only single taken from the release, and only reached number 93 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite this, Surfer Rosa was re-released in the U.S. by Elektra Records in 1992, and in 2005 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nSurfer Rosa is often cited as a favorite of music critics, and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best rock albums. Many alternative rock artists, including PJ Harvey and Billy Corgan, have cited the album as inspirational; Nirvana's Kurt Cobain frequently acknowledged that Surfer Rosa was a strong influence on Nevermind, and in 1993 hired the album's producer Steve Albini to produce his band's album In Utero.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tBone Machine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n2.\tBreak My Body ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n3.\tSomething Against You ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:47\n4.\tBroken Face ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:30\n5.\tGigantic (Francis/Kim Deal) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n6.\tRiver Euphrates ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33\n7.\tWhere Is My Mind?

The album's offbeat and dark subject material, featuring references to surrealism, Biblical violence, torture and death, contrasts with the clean production sound achieved by the newly hired producer Gil Norton. Doolittle was the Pixies' first international release, with Elektra Records acting as the album's distributor in the United States and PolyGram in Canada.\n\nPixies released two singles from Doolittle, &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;, both of which were chart successes on the US chart for Modern Rock Tracks. The album itself reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart, an unexpected success for the band. In retrospect, album tracks such as &quot;Debaser&quot;, &quot;Wave of Mutilation&quot;, &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Gouge Away&quot;, and &quot;Hey&quot; are highly acclaimed by critics, while the album, along with debut LP Surfer Rosa, is often seen as the band's strongest work.\n\nDoolittle has continued to sell consistently well in the years since its release, and in 1995 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album has been cited as inspirational by many alternative artists, while numerous music publications have ranked it as one of the most influential albums ever. A 2003 poll of NME writers ranked Doolittle as the second-greatest album of all time,[1] and Rolling Stone placed the album at 226 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tDebaser ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n2.\tTame ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55\n3.\tWave of Mutilation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04\n4.\tI Bleed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n5.\tHere Comes Your Man ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n6.\tDead ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:21\n7.\tMonkey Gone to Heaven ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n8.\tMr. Grieves ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n9.\tCrackity Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:24\n10.\tLa La Love You ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43\n11.\tNo. 13 Baby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n12.\tThere Goes My Gun ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:49\n13.\tHey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n14.\tSilver (Francis, Kim Deal) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:25\n15.\tGouge Away ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBossanova 1990\n\n\nBossanova is the third album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in August 1990 on the English independent record label 4AD in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. All of Bossanova's original material was written by the band's frontman Black Francis; it marked the point where his artistic control over the band became absolute. The album's sound, inspired by surf and space rock, complements its lyrical focus on outer space, which references subjects such as aliens and unidentified flying objects.\n\nBecause of 4AD's independent status, major label Elektra Records handled distribution in the United States; Bossanova reached number 70 on the Billboard 200. The album peaked at number three in the UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Bossanova, &quot;Velouria&quot; and &quot;Dig for Fire&quot;; both charted, at #4 and #11 respectively on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Cecilia Ann&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n2.\t&quot;Rock Music&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:52\n3.\t&quot;Velouria&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n4.\t&quot;Allison&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:17\n5.\t&quot;Is She Weird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n6.\t&quot;Ana&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:09\n7.\t&quot;All Over the World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n8.\t&quot;Dig for Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n9.\t&quot;Down to the Well&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n10.\t&quot;The Happening&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n11.\t&quot;Blown Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20\n12.\t&quot;Hang Wire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:01\n13.\t&quot;Stormy Weather&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n14.\t&quot;Havalina&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrompe le Monde 1991\n\n\nTrompe le Monde is the fifth and final album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in 1991 on the English independent record label 4AD in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. After the surf-pop of Bossanova, the album saw a return to the abrasive sound of the band's early albums.\n\nThe album was described by Michael Bonner, writing in Lime Lizard, as &quot;one of the best albums that you may very well ever hear&quot; and &quot;a strong contender for best album of the 21st century&quot;.[4] Allmusic writer Heather Phares noted the reduced role of Kim Deal, calling it &quot;essentially Black Francis' solo debut&quot;.\n\nThe album name comes from the title of the first track, &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot;, a French phrase meaning &quot;Fool the World&quot;.[1] Unlike previous albums, the title of the album comes from the name of a song (rather than a song lyric), and is a play on the French phrase &quot;trompe l'oeil&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a painting technique in which the painter fools the viewer into thinking objects presented are real.\n\n&quot;Head On&quot; is a cover of the Jesus and Mary Chain track that was released as a single reaching number 6 in the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks Chart.\n\n&quot;U-Mass&quot; is a sneering put down against the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where Black Francis met Joey Santiago before dropping out to form Pixies. Santiago recalls that the original guitar riff was written while they were still enrolled.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:48\n2.\t&quot;Planet of Sound&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:06\n3.\t&quot;Alec Eiffel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50\n4.\t&quot;The Sad Punk&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n5.\t&quot;Head On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:13\n6.\t&quot;U-Mass&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n7.\t&quot;Palace of the Brine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n8.\t&quot;Letter to Memphis&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:39\n9.\t&quot;Bird Dream of the Olympus Mons&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n10.\t&quot;Space (I Believe In)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n11.\t&quot;Subbacultcha&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:09\n12.\t&quot;Distance Equals Rate Times Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:24\n13.\t&quot;Lovely Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n14.\t&quot;Motorway to Roswell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n15.\t&quot;The Navajo Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath To The Pixies 1997\n\n\nDeath to the Pixies was the first Pixies best-of compilation, released by 4AD in the UK on October 6, 1997 and 4AD/Elektra the following day in the United States to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the band's debut. It covered the years 1987 to 1991. It is currently out of print, having been replaced by the 2004 compilation Wave of Mutilation: Best of Pixies. A limited edition of the compilation also included a second CD with a live performance taken from Vredenburg, Utrecht, Netherlands on the September 25, 1990. [1]\n\nThere was also another version of the limited edition, produced in extremely small quantities, that includes two rare &quot;Black Francis Demos&quot; (&quot;I'm Amazed&quot; and &quot;Broken Face&quot;). This is known as the &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; version, and has GT appended to its catalog number. [2] These demos, recorded in the apartment of producer Gary Smith the day before the band convened to record their full demo at Smith's Fort Apache Studios, feature only Francis singing and playing acoustic guitar (and giving notations to Smith about where the other band members' parts are). The complete &quot;Black Francis Demos&quot; were released as the first disc of 2004's Frank Black Francis 2-CD compilation.\n\nThe vinyl release contained all the tracks on the &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; version, spread out over four 10&quot; records. This was a limited release of over 9,000 copies.\n\n\nTracks:  (Limited Edition Bonus disc)\n\n1.\t&quot;Debaser&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n2.\t&quot;Rock Music&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:51\n3.\t&quot;Broken Face&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:21\n4.\t&quot;Isla de Encanta&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:42\n5.\t&quot;Hangwire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:00\n6.\t&quot;Dead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n7.\t&quot;Into the White&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n8.\t&quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n9.\t&quot;Gouge Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n10.\t&quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n11.\t&quot;Allison&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:16\n12.\t&quot;Hey&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n13.\t&quot;Gigantic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n14.\t&quot;Crackity Jones&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:35\n15.\t&quot;Something Against You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:46\n16.\t&quot;Tame&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n17.\t&quot;Wave of Mutilation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n18.\t&quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n19.\t&quot;Ed Is Dead&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n20.\t&quot;Vamos&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n21.\t&quot;Tony's Theme&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPixies At The BBC 1998\n\n\nPixies at the BBC is a compilation of live BBC radio sessions by the American alternative rock band Pixies.
