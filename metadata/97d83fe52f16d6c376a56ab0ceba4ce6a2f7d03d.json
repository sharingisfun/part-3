I converted them to mp3s using Audacity. They are stereo and 320kbps. They are categorized by year as according to the site. I have also zipped them into a RAR file.\n\nI am a musician and a big fan of Delia Derbyshire. She was a pioneer in electronic music and paved the way for electronic musicians and sampling artists of today. I hope these rare gems will forever be on the internet so many people can appreciate this woman's brilliance.\n\nPlease check out the site http://delia-derbyshire.net/ for everything about this amazing woman. Long live Delia!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97d83fe52f16d6c376a56ab0ceba4ce6a2f7d03d","amp;dn":"Delia+Derbyshire+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97d83fe52f16d6c376a56ab0ceba4ce6a2f7d03d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,216,63,229,47,22,214,195,118,165,106,176,206,186,76,230,162,247,208,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
