As of December 2010, Osbourne has sold over 100 million albums worldwide.\nOsbourne rose to prominence as lead vocalist of the pioneering English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, a band whose radically different, intentionally dark, doom sound spawned the heavy metal genre. In his subsequent solo career Osbourne achieved a multi-platinum status in addition to the one he had earned with Black Sabbath. These things are what led Osbourne to become known as the &quot;Godfather of Heavy Metal&quot;. It was during his Sabbath days that, due to their dark style of music, Osbourne became known as the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;. Osbourne has over 15 tattoos, the most famous of which are the letters O-Z-Z-Y across the knuckles of his left hand. This was his first tattoo, created by himself as a teenager with a sewing needle and pencil lead.\n\n.: Ozzy Osbourne :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img808.imageshack.us/img808/8692/002mcj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img808.imageshack.us/img808/8692/002mcj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n1 STUDIO ALBUMS\n1980 Blizzard Of Ozz (Jap Edition) @320\n1981 Diary Of A Madman (Jap Edition) @320\n1983 Bark At The Moon (Jap Edition) @320\n1986 The Ultimate Sin (Jap Edition) @320\n1988 No Rest For The Wicked (Jap Edition) @320\n1991 No More Tears (Jap Edition) @320\n1995 Ozzmosis (Jap Edition) @320\n2001 Down To Earth (Jap Edition) @320\n2007 Black Rain (Tour Edition USA) (2 CD) @320\n\n2 LIVE ALBUMS\n1982 Speak Of The Devil (Jap Edition) @320\n1987 Randy Rhoads Tribute (Jap Edition) @320\n1990 Just Say Ozzy (Jap Edition) @320\n1993 Live &amp; Loud (Jap Edition)(2 CD) @320\n2002 Live At Budokan (Jap Edition) @320\n\n3 TRIBUTE ALBUMS\n1980 Blizzard Of Ozz Tribute Part 1 @320\n1998 VA-Ozzyfied (The tribute to Ozzy Osbourne) @320\n2001 VA-Ozzfest - Second Stage Live (2 CD) @320\n2004 Iron Horse (Black and Bluegrass A Tribute to Ozzy Osbourne) @320\n2005 Under Cover (USA) @320\n2006 VA-The Worlds Greatest Tribute to Ozzy Osbourne @320\n\n4 COMPILATION ALBUMS\n1990 Ten Commandments (Limited Collector's Edition) @320\n1997 The Ozzman Cometh (2 CD) @320\n2003 The Essential Ozzy Osbourne (2 CD) @320\n2005 Prince of Darkness (4 CD Box Set) @320\n\n5 SOME SINGLES\n1980 Mr Crowley (Single 12' EP) @320\n1984 Prince Of Darkness (Single 12' EP) @320\n1985 Shot In The Dark (Single 12') @320\n1988 Close My Eyes Forever ( with Lita Ford) @320\n1988 Crazy Babies (Promo) @320\n1992 Mama I'm Coming Home @320\n1992 No More Tears Demo Sessions @320\n1993 Changes (Live &amp; Loud Sampler Single) @320\n1995 I Just Want You @320\n1996 I Just Want You @320\n1996 Perry Mason @320\n1996 See You On The Other Side (Sony Japan) @320\n1996 See You On The Other Side @320\n1996 Walk On Water (Promo) @320\n1997 Back On Earth @320\n1999 Buried Alive (Single Rick Wakeman feat.Ozzy Osbourne) @320\n1999 Shock the Monkey (Coal Chamber feat.Ozzy Osborne) @320\n2001 Gets Me Through @320\n2002 Dreamer @320\n2002 Mama I'm Coming Home (Promo) @320\n2003 Changes (Kelly &amp; Ozzy Osbourne) @320\n2003 Mama Im Coming Home @320\n\n6 OTHER ALBUMS (Unofficial archive)\n1980 Chelmsford Complete (+ Rare Bonus) @320\n1981 Montreal @320\n1981 Randy Rhoads (Axeman USA June 4 1981) @320\n1982 Blizzard On Tennessee @320\n1982 Paranoid Tokyo @320\n1982 Speak Of The Devil @320\n1984 Crazy Paranoia @320\n1986 King Biscuit Flower Hour @320\n1986 Live USA (Non-Studio Sources Germany) @320\n1986 Thank God For Ozz @320\n1989 Go Crazy (2CD) @320\n1995 Hollywood Palladium @320\n1995 Let The Madness Begin (Chile) @320\n2000 Back To Madness (Ozzfest) @320\n2000 Best Ballads (UK Unofficial) @320\n2007 Singles Collection Volumes 1 (Unofficial) @320\n2007 Singles Collection Volumes 2 (Unofficial) @320\n2008 Live At Quilmes Rock Festival Argentina) @320\n2009 Sunset Strip Music Festival (Sep 12) @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50da184ef29d1f5dce079972deea45923e0fabc5","amp;dn":"Ozzy+Osbourne+-+Solo+Discography+1980-2009+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Vi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50da184ef29d1f5dce079972deea45923e0fabc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,218,24,78,242,157,31,93,206,7,153,114,222,234,69,146,62,15,171,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
