Waves immediately come to mind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ larger waves repeat in slower, rolling tempo with more bass frequencies. Smaller lake waves lap and lick sand and rocks in a much faster, playful manner. Recording thunder is what brought me into this field. Thunder tends to have a slow repeat time between strikes. Anticipation mounts as the strikes slowly get closer to the listener each time too!\n\nFilder size - 286 MB\n\nFiles:\n01 - Call Of The Sea\n02 - Gulls At Coole\n03 - Fog Receding\n04 - Distant Sails\n05 - Passing Clouds\n06 - Chance Encounter\n07 - Cloudburst\n08 - Forest&amp;birds\n09 - Jungle and Sea\n10 - Rain\n11 - Sea Breathing\n12 - The Rain in the forest\n\nEnjoy! :)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41a72ad3f6e943d39e26ba7bff2ac138f992b7a1","amp;dn":"Nature+Sounds+%28Relaxation%26Meditation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41a72ad3f6e943d39e26ba7bff2ac138f992b7a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,167,42,211,246,233,67,211,158,38,186,123,255,42,193,56,249,146,183,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
