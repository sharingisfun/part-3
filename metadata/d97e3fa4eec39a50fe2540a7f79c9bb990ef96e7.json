This course will help you draft, design, and document these systems using MEP's powerful toolset. Author Eric Wing touches on project setup, as well as external referencing and display configurations, before diving into individual modeling scenarios. In one chapter, he'll show how to create electrical power plans and lighting plans with receptacles and lighting fixtures. In the next, it's a mechanical plan, with rooftop units, VAV boxes, ducts, and diffusers. Last, you'll work on a plumbing plan and system. Then he ties the drawings together with smart tags and schedules, and creates section and elevation versions of your plans. Dive in now and learn to eliminate tedious drawing tasks while creating more accurate documentation with MEP.\n\nTopics include:\n* Setting up a power plan\n* Creating power circuits\n* Adding wiring and lighting fixtures\n* Setting up a ducting plan\n* Routing ducts\n* Creating plumbing lines\n* Adding gas boilers\n* Adding detail components\n* Creating viewports, sheets, sections, and elevations\n* Configuring electrical and HVAC objects\n* Creating HVAC systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d97e3fa4eec39a50fe2540a7f79c9bb990ef96e7","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+AutoCAD+MEP+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d97e3fa4eec39a50fe2540a7f79c9bb990ef96e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,126,63,164,238,195,154,80,254,37,64,167,247,156,155,185,144,239,150,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
