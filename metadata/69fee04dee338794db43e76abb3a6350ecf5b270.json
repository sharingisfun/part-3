tagged audios\nUsually i dont do cams, since i want to get out quality only, but i couldnt refuse on this case, the movie is worth it\nworked a whole week on that on every spare time i had, so its gonna be good\n\nVideoEncode:\nthe video was great to begin with, it was bright enough, the colours are perfect, no kind of pixelation, even fast action scenes were flawless\nquality wise hard to beat, didnt have to change anything for the video itself\nthe cam i got was already clipped together from 2 recordings the same guy made, looks like he got disturbed on first try after 1h and went again and did the 2nd hour\nso first 1h he basically cammed straight ahead sitting in the center, but he aimed 15mins too high and than 15mins a bit too low and so on\nthe 2nd hour he tried camming from a corner, so video was still perfect but skewed angle and zoomed out, he still did a perfect job that can be fixed easily\n\nso basically i had to cut the movie in around 30 pieces and adjusted each spot as needed, i invested too much time but the result is perfect\n\nto already answer the first comment that will pop up for sure, is there anything missing from the video?\nyes i had to cut out 30secs at runtime 15mins and another 20secs at 20min, and at the church scene another 30secs\nso 80seconds are missing due security cause he aimed to the ceiling or floor, does it matter no, its no biggy at all\n\nAudioEncode:\nfor the audio i was quite surprised, it was very good, bet someone might tag it as line but it isnt\nas mentioned above you can hear clearly what is said all the time, music and effects are all good, 2 times you can hear a phone ring, lol\n\nthe audio i got was full and direct, so i started syncing it to my video, was done in 5h, whole movie is lipsync now, love to do that\n\nall in all its quite perfect for a cam i would say 8/10 for video and audio, check sample if you like\n\ngot very nice\nenjoy\n\nVideo: 720x304 @bitrate 1800 2pass\nAudio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo\nSubs: English subs for foreign parts only were already hardcoded\n\nPS:\nsince i have done all @720p a higher encode is possible if ya want\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/5/SnzX8PTj.png&quot;
