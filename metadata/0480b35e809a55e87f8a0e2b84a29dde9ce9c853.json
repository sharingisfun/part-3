The materials covered are self-contained and presented in such detail that allows readers with only undergraduate electrical engineering knowledge in EM, RF, and circuits to understand and design RFICs. Organized into sixteen chapters, blending analog and microwave engineering, Radio-Frequency Integrated-Circuit Engineering emphasizes the microwave engineering approach for RFICs.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Provides essential knowledge in EM and microwave engineering, passive and active RFICs, RFIC analysis and design techniques, and RF systems vital for RFIC students and engineers\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Blends analog and microwave engineering approaches for RFIC design at high frequencies\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes problems at the end of each chapter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0480b35e809a55e87f8a0e2b84a29dde9ce9c853","amp;dn":"Radio-Frequency+Integrated-Circuit+Engineering+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0480b35e809a55e87f8a0e2b84a29dde9ce9c853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,128,179,94,128,154,85,232,127,138,14,43,132,162,157,222,156,233,200,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
