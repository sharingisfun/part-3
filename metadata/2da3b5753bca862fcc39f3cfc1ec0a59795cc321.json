Described as &quot;arguably the most lucid, wide-ranging and consistently interesting religion writer today,&quot; she is a former Roman Catholic religious sister who went from a conservative to a more liberal and mystical Christian faith.  \n\nArmstrong first rose to prominence with her book A HISTORY OF GOD (1993), which traces the evolution of the three major monotheistic traditions from their beginnings in the Middle East up to the present day and also discusses Hinduism and Buddhism.  Her work as a whole focuses on commonalities among the major religions, such as the importance of compassion and the Golden Rule, and she is a tireless advocate for inter-faith dialogue and ecumenical understanding.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* THE BATTLE FOR GOD (Random House, 2011)\n\n* THE BIBLE: The Biography (Atlantic, 2007)\n\n* BUDDHA: A Penguin Life (Penguin, 2004)\n\n* THE CASE FOR GOD (Knopf, 2009)\n\n* THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO WOMAN: Christianity's Creation of the Sex War in the West (Anchor, 1987) -- PDF\n\n* THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION: The Beginning of Our Religious Traditions (Knopf, 2006)\n\n* A HISTORY OF GOD: The 4000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (Knopf, 1993) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* HOLY WAR: The Crusades and Their Impact on Today's World (Anchor, 2001) -- PDF\n\n* IN THE BEGINNING: A New Interpretation of Genesis (Ballantine, 1996)\n\n* ISLAM: A Short History (Modern Library, 2002)\n\n* JERUSALEM: One City, Three Faiths (Knopf, 1996)\n\n* MUHAMMAD: A Prophet for Our Time (HarperCollins, 2006)\n\n* A SHORT HISTORY OF MYTH (Canongate, 2005)\n\n* THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE: My Climb Out of Darkness (Knopf, 2004)\n\n* TWELVE STEPS TO A COMPASSIONATE LIFE (Knopf, 2011)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
