The hits which catapulted him to fame in the early '70s, the anthemic &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; of course, but also the likes of &quot;I'm the Leader of the Gang,&quot; &quot;Do You Wanna Touch Me,&quot; and &quot;I Love You Love Me Love,&quot; still have the capacity to stir an audience -- as &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; itself proves, every time it airs at a major sporting event in the U.S. And, if it is at all oxymoronic that the King of British Glam should be responsible for one of the national anthems of American Football, then that is simply further testament of what made Gary glitter so brightly. Musically, visually, and emotionally, he transcended so many barriers that even categorizing him as a rock &amp; roller seems somehow stingy. He was so much more than that.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/rock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Rock And Roll Part II\n02.I'm The Leader Of The Gang (I Am)\n03.Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again\n04.Doing Alright With The Boys\n05.Ii Didn't Know I Loved You (Till I Saw You Rock And Roll)\n06.Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\n07.I Love You Love Me Love\n08.Love Like You And Me\n09.Remember Me This Way\n10.Always Yours\n11.Oh Yes, You're Beautiful\n12.The Wanderer\n13.Rock On\n14.Baby Please Don't Go\n15.You Belong To Me\n16.The Clapping Song\n17.Hard On Me\n18.Good For No Good\n19.Hands Up!
