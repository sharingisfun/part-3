It's also the default option on Mac OS X and Linux. But Bash is different than most scripting languages. That's why Scott Simpson spends some time in this course running you through the syntaxÃ¢â‚¬â€introducing variables, numbers, and control structuresÃ¢â‚¬â€so you can start writing scripts right away.
