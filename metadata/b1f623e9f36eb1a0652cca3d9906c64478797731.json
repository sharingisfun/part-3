Due to numerous line-up changes, the only original member present in the band is its eponymous drummer, Mick Fleetwood. Despite band founder Peter Green naming the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood, McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts, as McVie had to straighten things out with Mayall before joining the band. The keyboardist, Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album Kiln House.\n\nThe two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with &quot;Albatross&quot;; and from 1975 to 1987, with more pop-orientation, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song &quot;Dreams&quot;, which was the band's only U.S. number one) and remained at No.1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth highest selling album of all time.\n\nThe band achieved more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with the line-up including Bob Welch, and also during the 1990s which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997, and more recently, the departure of Christine McVie. In 1998, Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFleetwood Mac, sometimes known as Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, is the debut album by the band Fleetwood Mac, released in 1968. The album is a mixture of blues covers and originals penned by guitarists Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer, who also share the vocal duties.\n\nThe release of the album brought the band overnight success; in the UK, the album reached #4 and stayed on the charts 37 weeks, despite the lack of a hit single. The album barely made the charts in the US, reaching #198.\n\nAn expanded version of this album was included in the box set The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f623e9f36eb1a0652cca3d9906c64478797731","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+Peter+Green%27s+Fleetwood+Mac+%5B2004%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f623e9f36eb1a0652cca3d9906c64478797731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,246,35,233,243,110,177,160,101,44,202,61,153,6,198,68,120,121,119,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
