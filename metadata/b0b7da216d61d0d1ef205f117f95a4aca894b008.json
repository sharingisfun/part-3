Drawing upon research from a 10-year study of more than 24,000 people in two dozen organizations, they argue that tribes have the greatest influence in determining how much and what quality work gets done. The authors identify the five stages of employee tribal developmentÃ¢â‚¬â€Life sucks, My life sucks, I'm great and you're not, We're great and Life is greatÃ¢â‚¬â€and offer advice on how to manage these groups. They also share insights from the health care, philanthropic, engineering, biotechnology and other industries and include key points lists for each chapter. Particularly useful is the Tribal Leader's Cheat Sheet, which helps determine and assess success indicators. Well written and enlightening, this book will be of interest to business professionals at all levels. (Feb.) \nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
