Abigail enjoys long naps in fairy-filled glades, running through corridors in tragically romantic haunted castles, and drinking goblet after goblet of spiced wine.\n===============\n\n\nUnemployed, blacklisted, and pregnant, Sophie ScaifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is totally upside down. Her relationship with publishing magnate Neil Elwood is on the rocks. Her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career is igniting. And Sophie is afraid sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make one of the toughest decisions of her life aloneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWhen a devastating diagnosis forces Neil to return to London, Sophie throws caution to the wind to follow her heart across the Atlantic. Keeping a scorching D/s affair as red-hot in sickness as it was in health is a challenge, even for two lovers as inventive as Sophie and Neil. But Sophie is more than willing to try anything her Sir commands, and their fantasies of control become a welcome refuge from the daily stress of illness.\n\nWhile NeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealth and privilege make adjusting to her new situation easier, Sophie finds herself rebuilding her life around an uncertain future. And while both of them face the changes between them head-on, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all too aware that their happiness may be fleetingÃ¢â‚¬â€and Sophie could lose Neil forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b992e3a5c358aef6faaf6acbce2f96c97ddea359","amp;dn":"Abigail+Barnette%2C+The+Girlfriend+%28the+boss+series+%232%29+epub+%5Bdova","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b992e3a5c358aef6faaf6acbce2f96c97ddea359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,146,227,165,195,88,174,246,250,175,106,203,206,47,150,201,125,222,163,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
