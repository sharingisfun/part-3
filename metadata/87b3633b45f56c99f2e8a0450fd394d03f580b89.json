The sixth season premiered on October 2, 2011. The series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a bloodstain pattern analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department who moonlights as a serial killer. Set in Miami, the show's first season was largely based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay, the first of his Dexter series novels. Subsequent seasons have evolved independently of Lindsay's works; several based on short stories by Lindsay's friend, Stephen R. Pastore. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode.\n\nIn February 2008, syndicated reruns (edited down to a TV-14 rating) began to air on CBS. The series has enjoyed wide critical acclaim and popularity. Season 4 aired its season finale on December 13, 2009 to a record-breaking audience of 2.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode ever on Showtime. Michael C. Hall has received several awards and nominations for his portrayal of Dexter, including a Golden Globe. On November 18, 2011, it was announced that Dexter had been renewed for a seventh and eighth season.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nTSV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b3633b45f56c99f2e8a0450fd394d03f580b89","amp;dn":"Dexter+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5%2C+6+%2B+Extras+DVDRip+HDTV+TSV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b3633b45f56c99f2e8a0450fd394d03f580b89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,179,99,59,69,245,108,153,242,232,160,69,15,211,148,208,63,88,11,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
