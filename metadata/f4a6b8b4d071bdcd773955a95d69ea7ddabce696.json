The film follows evangelical leaders in America and Uganda along with politicians and missionaries as they attempt the radical task of eliminating Ã¢â‚¬Å“sexual sinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and converting Ugandans to fundamentalist Christianity. As an American influenced bill to make homosexuality punishable by death wins widespread support, tension in Uganda mounts and an atmosphere of murderous hatred takes hold. The film reveals the conflicting motives of faith and greed, ecstasy and egotism, among Ugandan ministers, American evangelical leaders and the foot soldiers of a theology that sees Uganda as a test case, ground zero in a battle not for millions, but billions of souls.Through vÃƒÂ©ritÃƒÂ©, interviews,  hidden camera footage, and with unprecedented access, God Loves Uganda takes viewers inside the evangelical movement in both the US and Uganda. It features Lou Engle, creator of The Call, which brings tens of thousands of believers together to pray against sexual sin. It provides a rare view of the most powerful evangelical minister in Uganda, who lives in a mansion where heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s served by a white-coated chef. It goes into a Ugandan church where a preacher whips a congregation into mass hysteria with anti-gay rhetoric. It records the culture clash between enthusiastic Midwestern missionaries and world weary Ugandans. It features a heartbreaking interview with gay activist David Kato shortly before he was murdered. It tells the moving story of Bishop Christopher Senyonjo, a minister excommunicated, ostracized and literally spat on for being tolerant and his remarkable campaign for peace and healing in Uganda. Shocking, horrifying, touching and enlightening, God Loves Uganda will make you question what you thought you knew about religion.\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFile size                                : 2.70 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 23mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 4 646 Kbps\nMovie name                               : God Loves Uganda\nGenre                                    : Documentary\n\n====Video====\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e0a8898788a0acd3ced1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : No\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 2 frames\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 1h 23mn\nBit rate                                 : 4 126 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 716 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.188\nStream size                              : 2.40 GiB (89%)\n\n====Audio #1====\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nDuration                                 : 1h 23mn\nSource duration                          : 1h 23mn\nBit rate                                 : 124 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 73.7 MiB (3%)\nLanguage                                 : English\n\n====Audio #2====\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nDuration                                 : 1h 23mn\nSource duration                          : 1h 23mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 6 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 229 MiB (8%)\nLanguage                                 : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a6b8b4d071bdcd773955a95d69ea7ddabce696","amp;dn":"God+Loves+Uganda+%282013%29+720p+H264%2FAC3+5.1%2FAAC+Stereo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a6b8b4d071bdcd773955a95d69ea7ddabce696","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,166,184,180,208,113,189,205,119,57,85,169,93,105,234,125,218,188,230,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
