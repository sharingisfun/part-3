Branagh stars in the title role, and wrote the screenplay. The film was highly acclaimed on its release.\n\nBranagh's film is frequently compared with the 1944 film of the play directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. The visual style of Branagh's film is grittier and more realist than that of Olivier's. For example, his film avoids Olivier's use of stylized sets, and, where Olivier staged the Battle of Agincourt on a sunlit field, Branagh's takes place amid rain-drenched mud and gore.\n\nThe text of the play is heavily cut. In addition, Branagh incorporated flashbacks using extracts from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 in which Henry interacts with the character of Falstaff, who, in Shakespeare's Henry V, is never seen, merely announced to be deathly ill in Act 2 Scene 1, and dead in Act 2 scene 3. The scenes involve a brief summary of Henry's denouncement of Falstaff primarily with lines from Act 2, Scene 4 of Henry IV part 1 and a brief though important utterance of Henry's final repudiation of Falstaff in Part 2, &quot;I know thee not, old man.&quot; The movie also uses Falstaff's line &quot;do not, when thou art King, hang a thief&quot; from Henry IV Part 1 but gives it to Bardolph, in order to highlight the poignancy when Henry later has Bardolph executed.\n\nWhile the text of the Chorus' monologues are the same, the setting for them has been adapted to reflect the nature of the motion picture adaptation of the play. Unlike the other performers, who are dressed in clothing contemporary to the actual Henry V to reflect their characters, The Chorus is dressed in modern 20th century clothing. The opening monologue, originally written to compensate for the limitations of on stage theater to represent the historical scenes presented, is delivered on an empty motion picture sound stage with unfinished sets. The other chorus monologues are delivered on location where the relevant action is taking place. In all cases, the chorus speaks directly to the camera, addressing the audience.\n\nCast\nDerek Jacobi \t... \tChorus\nKenneth Branagh \t... \tKing Henry V\nSimon Shepherd \t... \tDuke Humphrey of Gloucester\nJames Larkin \t... \tDuke John of Bedford\nBrian Blessed \t... \tDuke Thomas Beaufort of Exeter\nJames Simmons \t... \tDuke Edward of York\nCharles Kay \t... \tArchbishop of Canterbury\nAlec McCowen \t... \tBishop of Ely\nFabian Cartwright \t... \tEarl Richard of Cambridge\nStephen Simms \t... \tLord Henry Scroop\nJay Villiers \t... \tSir Thomas Grey\nEdward Jewesbury \t... \tSir Thomas Erpingham\nIan Holm \t... \tCaptain Fluellen\nDanny Webb \t... \tGower (as Daniel Webb)\nJimmy Yuill \t... \tJamy ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e0a32bb2abeb9b0fcf5d8c3c7e5f1488913ce5","amp;dn":"Henry+V+%281989+Film%29+Shakespeare+-+Kevin+Branagh%2C+Emma+Thompson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e0a32bb2abeb9b0fcf5d8c3c7e5f1488913ce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,224,163,43,178,171,235,155,15,207,93,140,60,126,95,20,136,145,60,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
