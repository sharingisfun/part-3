Released in 1972, it was her commercial breakthrough.\n The album spent five weeks at #1 on the Billboard charts and quickly went gold,[2] as did its leadoff single, &quot;You're So Vain&quot;,\n which remained at #1 on the Pop charts for three weeks, and #1 on the Adult Contemporary charts for two weeks.25 years after\n its initial release, the album was officially certified platinum on December 12, 1997.\nThe photograph for the cover, taken by Ed Caraeff, was taken in front of the Portobello Hotel, on Stanley Gardens in London's\n Notting Hill.The cover attracted attention because the erect nipples of the braless Carly Simon could be discerned through\n her shirt.\n\n    1973 Grammy (Nominated) Best Pop Female Vocalist: You're So Vain\n    1973 Grammy (Nominated) Record Of The Year (Single): You're So Vain\n    2004 Grammy Hall Of Fame (Inducted) You're So Vain - Pop Single\n\n=====================================\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 - The Right Thing to Do.flac\nA2 - The Carter Family.flac\nA3 - You're So Vain.flac\nA4 - His Friends Are More Than Fond of Robin.flac\nA5 - We Have No Secrets.flac\nB1 - Embrace Me, You Child.flac\nB2 - Waited So Long.flac\nB3 - It Was So Easy.flac\nB4 - Night Owl.flac\nB5 - When You Close Your Eyes.flac\n\n========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 714 MiB\nAlbum                                    : No Secrets\nTrack name/Total                         : 10\nPerformer                                : Carly Simon\nGenre                                    : Pop\nRecorded date                            : 1972\nComment                                  : Friday Music 180g; half-speed mastered by Joe Ragoso &amp; Ron McMaster\n\n====================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 712 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f2ff9147dee182fba9681b0f05779199fc82216","amp;dn":"Carly+Simon+-+No+Secrets+%281972%29+FLAC%5B24+Bit+96+KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f2ff9147dee182fba9681b0f05779199fc82216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,47,249,20,125,238,24,47,186,150,129,176,240,87,121,25,159,200,34,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
