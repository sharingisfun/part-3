The breakup and divorce rate remain incredibly high, despite all the couples therapy, afternoon talk shows, and other books in the marketplace, many of which describe men as abusive commitment phobic creeps who'd better change fast or else. But this new book is totally different, a whole different way of looking at how to build a successful long-lasting relationship from a man's point of view, men who are happy in their partnerships, who have figured out what works for them in accomplishing the goal of a loving, intimate, lifetime commitment. Dr. Scott Haltzman, Clinical Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University, and founder of www.secretsofmarriedmen.com, has devised a proven method for improving relationships, based on a man's special and unique skills, strengths, powersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as a responsible and motivated worker, manager, leader, problem-solver, partner, husband, and father. Men are different, Dr. Haltzman says. They don't approach relationships with the same skills and techniques that women doÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and viva la difference. Dr.Haltzman therefore lays out eight ways, tasks, proven techniques which men have revealed in confidential correspondence to his highly successful website, including The First Way: Make Your Marriage Your Job, The Second Way: Know Your Wife, The Third Way: Be Home Now, The Fourth Way: Expect Conflict and Deal With It, The Fifth Way: Learn to Listen, The Sixth Way: Aim to Please, The Seventh Way: Understand the Truth About Sex, The Eighth Way: Introduce Yourself, and finally, Celebrate Your Love. Within each of these steps, he provides both specific analysis, guidelines and techniques based on male biology, neuro-science, brain differences, unique developmental stages from youth to seniority. To illustrate these ideas in action, he's included wonderful true stories, anecdotes, and confessions from the website. The result is a practical, very entertaining, totally original way to build successful relationships for men and their partners, girlfriends, and wives. For a lasting commitment, a continuing guide to solving inevitable problems and bumps in the road, for more fun, better sex, genuine intimacy, and a life-long partnershipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this dynamic new author shows the way in a manner that finally includes an authentic male perspective............................\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY...........................\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c6bf3f1208dbc1dd15d056667157605c547e138","amp;dn":"The+Secrets+of+Happily+Married+Men%3A+Eight+Ways+to+Win+Your+Wife","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c6bf3f1208dbc1dd15d056667157605c547e138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,107,243,241,32,141,188,29,209,93,5,102,103,21,118,5,197,71,225,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
