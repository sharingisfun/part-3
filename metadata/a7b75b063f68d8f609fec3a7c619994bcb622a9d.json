The lengthy and complex work takes place in a semi-parodic future version of North America, and touches on tennis, substance addiction and recovery programs, depression, child abuse, family relationships, advertising and popular entertainment, film theory, and Quebec separatism, among other topics. Wallace was 33 when the novel was published.\nThe novel includes 388 numbered endnotes (some of which have footnotes of their own) that explain or expound on points in the story. In an interview with Charlie Rose, Wallace characterized their use as a method of disrupting the linearity of the text while maintaining some sense of narrative cohesion.In 2005, Time magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7b75b063f68d8f609fec3a7c619994bcb622a9d","amp;dn":"Infinite+Jest+-+Wallace_+David+Foster.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7b75b063f68d8f609fec3a7c619994bcb622a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,183,91,6,63,104,216,246,9,254,195,167,198,25,153,75,203,98,42,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
