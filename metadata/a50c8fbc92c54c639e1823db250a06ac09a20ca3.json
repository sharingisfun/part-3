Give it a try I know you will like this. Your friends will be so jealous you have it and they don't.\n\nRipped MP3 V0 which is nearly identical to FLAC using spectral analysis at a fraction of the file size.  Original CD's were used as source.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n[quote]By A Customer\n\nKruder and Dorfmeister are truly the leaders of the remix school. Anything that falls on their hands get sculptured and molded into a totally different piece of music work. Take Roni Size's &quot;Heroes&quot;. If you didn't know the song title, you wouldn't have known that it was a drum'n'bass song initially before getting remixed - you might have thought that it was a completely new song all on its own. Also pay attention to Mama Oliver's &quot;Eastwest/Stoned Together&quot; and even Bone Thugs 'n' Harmony's &quot;1st Of Tha Month&quot;. Personally though the stand-out track has got to be Lamb's &quot;Transfattyacid&quot;. Louise Rhodes glides over K&amp;D's reworked beats like a seagull over calm sea, resulting in an absolutely grand finale for the first disc. Richard Dorfmeister mentioned in February 99's Raygun that the first disc is 'more up and jazzy' while the second is 'more laid back and slow'. True enough, that is what The K&amp;D Sessions is all about. Compared to K&amp;D's previous release, the DJ-Kicks album also from Studio K7, the K&amp;D Sessions is more conceptual and abstract. Listening to the album gives you that sort of late night, lounge room, cocktail and martini, velvet couch feel. Truly stylish, relaxing and most of all, absolutely cool. This is the kind of music that club owners should exploit to give their clubs class and eclat, not cheesy R&amp;B or the like. So take note, sit up and pay attention to Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister - class is in session.[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister - The K&amp;D Sessions\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister\nAlbum................: The K&amp;D Sessions\nGenre................: Electronic\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: CBR 256, (avg. bitrate: 256kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Disc 1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
