The acronym VAST stands for Visual Audio Sensory Theater and is the main creation of singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Jon Crosby. The band is signed to 2blossoms, an independent record company created by Crosby himself.\n\nVAST's sound is identifiable as ambient electro-rock with considerable industrial and acoustic influences, usually made with Crosby's traditional acoustic guitar, electronic instruments and processing, drum-driven tracks, and heavy bass. In recent years, however, VAST's sound has been more identifiable with acoustic rock in releases such as April and Me and You.\n\nIncluded in the torrent is their full discography and all their lives, alongside with their separate torrents. Album covers not included. \n\nThis is a secondary torrent upload; I didn't create it. But I do hope you will enjoy it.\n\nFor more info, album covers, photos, biography, lyrics, related artists, videos and tour dates visit: http://www.realvast.com/\n\nDon't forget to seed, guys!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:955258c715bd6dfbba7c8741baf583115f3c1e27","amp;dn":"VAST+-+Full+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"955258c715bd6dfbba7c8741baf583115f3c1e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,82,88,199,21,189,109,251,186,124,135,65,186,245,131,17,95,60,30,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
