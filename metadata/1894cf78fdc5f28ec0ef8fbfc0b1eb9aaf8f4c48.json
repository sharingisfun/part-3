It uses both Metric and US inches/feet. By using the Tape Measure, Tailor's Tape or the Protractor, you can remove the â€œguessworkâ€ from your artwork.\r\n\r\nMeasure Metrics comes with &quot;Pre-set&quot; nodes to help you measure the dimensions of your favorite figures. It also allows you to set up your own nodes to measure any kind of props or even empty space between figures within your scene. \r\n\r\nA script included with Measure Metrics allows you to configure morphs which control the dimensions of your figure, allowing you to set the dimensions and have the figure automatically adjust the morphs to match the dimensions you entered. \r\n\r\nMeasure your figure's or prop's dimensions or configure the tool to automatically set your figure to dimensions that you specify without having to adjust dozens of morph sliders.\r\n\r\nThis is a fun and powerful tool!\r\n \nhttp://www.daz3d.com/measure-metrics-for-daz-studio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1894cf78fdc5f28ec0ef8fbfc0b1eb9aaf8f4c48","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+Measure+Metrics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1894cf78fdc5f28ec0ef8fbfc0b1eb9aaf8f4c48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,148,207,120,253,197,242,142,192,239,143,191,192,177,235,154,175,143,76,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
