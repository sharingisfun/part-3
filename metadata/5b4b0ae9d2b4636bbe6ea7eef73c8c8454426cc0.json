Rockin' Chair is so awesome.\n\n- Big Papi \n\nimage\n\n\nBy Paul Tognetti\nThat's right. If I were stranded on an island and had the choice of listening to the recordings of any one artist I would choose the Mills Brothers. According to Jay Warners &quot;Billboard Book of American Singing Groups&quot;, the Mills Brothers were the most successful American male group of all time with 71 chart singles spanning four decades. Hailing from Piqua, Ohio, the Mills Brothers started performing way back in 1922. The group consisted of four brothers, Donald, Harry Herbert and John Jr. They signed their first recording contract with Brunswick records in 1931 and were an immediate sensation. Aside from remarkable harmony, the group also simulated instruments!!! In fact, the labels on many of their records had a notice that no musical instruments were included on the recordings. To sample the original recordings of the early Mills Brothers, pick up &quot;Four Boys and A Guitar: The Essential Mills Brothers&quot; on the Sony Legacy label.\n\nIn 1934 the group signed with Decca records. They would remain with the label for over a quarter century. During this period, they were one of the most prolific artists around recording literally hundreds of singles. Tragically, one of the brothers, John Jr. passed away in 1936 to replaced by his father who performed with the group until the mid 1950's.\n\nAs another reviewer has pointed out, the early Mills Brothers songs on this CD that originally appeared on Brunswick are re-recordings. But as far as I can tell, all of the Decca sides are the original recordings. Listen to them again for the first time and rediscover why this group was so beloved for so many years. They just don't make 'em like this anymore. In my opinion, &quot;Paper Doll&quot; was one of the great songs of the century. You'll also enjoys such all-time favorites as &quot;Glow Worm&quot;, &quot;Till Then&quot; and &quot;Opus One&quot;. And check out one of their later hits, 1957's &quot;Queen of the Senior Prom&quot;. Group harmony just does not get any better then this folks. The three remaining Mills Brothers continued to perform into the 1980's. My wife was fortunate enough to catch one of their final performances. Their music is timeless. You'll love this anthology.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMills Brothers, The - The Mills Brothers: The Anthology (1931-1968)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Mills Brothers, The\nAlbum................: The Mills Brothers: The Anthology (1931-1968)\nGenre................: Easy Listening\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1995\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Poor, (avg. bitrate: 158kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisc 1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
