Written by the founders of Kings County Distillery, New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first distillery since Prohibition, this spirited illustrated book explores AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s age-old love affair with whiskey. It begins with chapters on whiskeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history and culture from 1640 to today, when the DIY trend and the classic cocktail craze have conspired to make it the next big thing. For those thirsty for practical information, the book next provides a detailed, easy-to-follow guide to safe home distilling, complete with a list of supplies, step-by-step instructions, and helpful pictures, anecdotes, and tips. The final section focuses on the contemporary whiskey scene, featuring a list of microdistillers, cocktail and food recipes from the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hottest mixologists and chefs, and an opinionated guide to building your own whiskey collection.
