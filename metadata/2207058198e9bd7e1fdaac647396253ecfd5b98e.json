They were well-known in the Philly area for their supple, airtight harmonies talent that brought them to the attention of record producers, eventually landing them a contract with Cameo-Parkway. While their early records brought them little if any notice, it did bring them to the attention of producer/arranger Thom Bell who signed the band to his soon-to-be influential soul label Philly Groove. Right from the start this was a perfect match as the band released the classic &quot;La La Means I Love You&quot; in 1968, a song that began a string of hits lasting into the mid-'70s.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.La-La (Means I Love You)\n02.I'm Sorry\n03.Break Your Promise\n04.Ready Or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide From Love)\n05.Somebody Loves You\n06.Funny Feeling\n07.Loving Him\n08.You Got Yours And I'll Get Mine\n09.Didn' I (Blow Your Mind This This Time)\n10.Trying To Make A Fool Of Me\n11.When You Get Right Down To It\n12.Over And Over\n13.Delfonics Theme\n14.Hey Love\n15.Walk Right Up To The Sun\n16.Tell Me This Is A Dream\n17.Think It Over\n18.I Don't Want To Make You Wait\n19.I Told You So\n20.Lying To Myself\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2207058198e9bd7e1fdaac647396253ecfd5b98e","amp;dn":"The+Delfonics+-+Definitive+Collection+%282002%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2207058198e9bd7e1fdaac647396253ecfd5b98e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,7,5,129,152,233,189,126,31,218,172,100,115,150,37,62,207,213,185,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
