This collection of his essays from Natural History magazine explores a myriad of cosmic topics, from astral life at the frontiers of astrobiology to the movie industry's feeble efforts to get its images of night skies right.\r\n\r\nTyson introduces us to the physics of black holes by explaining what would happen to our bodies if we fell into one; he also examines the needless friction between science and religion, and notes Earth's status as &quot;an insignificantly small speck in the cosmos&quot;.\r\nRenowned for his ability to blend content, accessibility, and humor, Tyson is a natural teacher who simplifies some of the most complex concepts in astrophysics while sharing his infectious excitement for our universe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c1d7f76dea6336d201e0200085e1344a42b36c6","amp;dn":"Death+by+Black+Hole_+And+Other+Cosmic+Quandaries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c1d7f76dea6336d201e0200085e1344a42b36c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,29,127,118,222,166,51,109,32,30,2,0,8,94,19,68,164,43,54,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
