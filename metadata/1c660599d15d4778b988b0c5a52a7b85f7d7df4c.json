It features 14 of Jackson's top 40 hits from her three previous albums; Control (1986), Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), janet. (1993), and two new tracks; &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Twenty Foreplay&quot;. It was well received by many critics, who cited the amount of hit singles on the record, but many noted its misleading title, since a majority of the songs came from the period of 1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990. It was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA[1] and has since sold 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Runaway\n[02] What Have You Done For Me Lately\n[03] Nasty\n[04] When I Think Of You\n[05] Escapade\n[06] Miss You Much\n[07] Whoops Now\n[08] Love Will Never Do (Without You)\n[09] Alright\n[10] The Best Things In Life Are Free - - - Janet Jackson &amp; Luther Vandross\n[11] Control\n[12] The Pleasure Principle\n[13] Black Cat\n[14] Rhythm Nation\n[15] That's The Way Love Goes\n[16] Come Back To Me\n[17] Let's Wait Awhile\n[18] Twenty Foreplay\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:17m:48s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Young love (12&quot; Dance Mix)\n[02] Diamonds (Cool Summer Mix Edit)\n[03] The knowledge (Q Sound Mix)\n[04] Say You Do\n[05] Don't Stand Another Chance\n[06] French Blue\n[07] When I Think Of You (Jazzy Mix)\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 00h:40m:58s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:58m:46s\nTotal File Size....................... 292mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
