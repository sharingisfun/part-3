It is a book of sense and common sense, not only about magick, but about religion and one of the most critical issues of today: how to achieve the much needed and wholesome relationship with our Earth. Cunningham presents Wicca as it is today: a gentle, Earth-oriented religion dedicated to the Goddess and God. Wicca also includes Scott CunninghamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own Book of Shadows and updated appendices of periodicals and occult suppliers.\n\n\nAuthor(s):\tScott Cunningham\nPublisher:\tLlewellyn Publications\nDate:\t1993\nFormat: PDF\nSBN13:\t9780875421186\nSize: 7.06 mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:866fd0e53049ce3562994d57798ff9f0ace286a7","amp;dn":"+Wicca%3A++A+Guide+for+the+Solitary+Practitioner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"866fd0e53049ce3562994d57798ff9f0ace286a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,111,208,229,48,73,206,53,98,153,77,87,121,143,249,240,172,226,134,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
