Translated with Introduction and Notes by Richard Freeborn.\n\nISBN: 9780140445220 | 416 pages | ePUB\n\n\nIVAN SERGEYEVICH TURGENEV (1818-1883) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, and playwright, and the first Russian writer to enjoy an international reputation.\n\nTurgenev's first major prose work, published in 1852, is a series of twenty-five short stories and considered a milestone of  Russian realism: the observations and anecdotes of the author during his travels through Russia satisfying his passion for hunting.  His album is filled with moving insights into the lives of those he encounters -- peasants and landowners, doctors and bailiffs, neglected wives and bereft mothers -- each providing a glimpse of love, tragedy, courage and loss, and anticipating Turgenev's great later works such as &quot;First Love&quot; and &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;.  His depiction of the cruelty and arrogance of the ruling classes was considered subversive and led to his arrest and confinement to his estate, but these sketches opened the minds of contemporary readers to the plight of the peasantry and were even said to have led Tsar Alexander II to abolish serfdom.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
