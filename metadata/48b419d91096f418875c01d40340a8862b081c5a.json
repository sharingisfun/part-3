With Sweet's studio albums, included here are the studio albums from Andy Scott's Sweet, Brian Connolly's Sweet's 1 studio album, and Steve Priest's Sweet's live album from 2009. Also here are a few various compilations such as Sweet's &quot;First Recordings 1968-1971&quot;, &quot;Platinum Rare&quot;, and 2009's &quot;Action: The Sweet Anthology&quot;, possibly the greatest Sweet compilation so far.\n\nFor the most part, everything has a CBR of 320, except for 2 albums; 1 being Andy Scott's Sweet's &quot;SweetLife&quot; with a VBR of around 190 Kbps and Steve Priest's Sweet's live album &quot;Live! In America&quot; which has a VBR of around 210 or so, so sorry about the par-average quality for those 2 albums, didn't have them so just picked them up from around the net.\n\nOther than those 2 flaws, everything has a CBR of 320, so enjoy!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   ALBUMS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSWEET ALBUMS:\n\n1971 - Gimme Dat Ding (Tie in compilation album with The Pipkins)\n\n1971 - Funny How Sweet Co-Co Can Be (2005 Reissue with Bonus Tracks)\n\n1973 - Live At The Rainbow (Released in 1999)\n\n1974 - Sweet Fanny Adams (2005 Reissue with Bonus Tracks)\n\n1974 - Desolation Boulevard (2005 Reissue with Bonus Tracks)\n\n1975 - Strung Up (Studio/Live Compilation Album)\n\n1976 - Give Us A Wink (2005 Reissue with Bonus Tracks)\n\n1976 - Live In Denmark (Released in 1998)\n\n1977 - Off The Record (2005 Reissue with Bonus Tracks)\n\n1978 - Level Headed (2005 Reissue with Bonus Tracks)\n\n1979 - Cut Above The Rest\n\n1980 - Waters Edge\n\n1982 - Identity Crisis\n\n1989 - Live At The Marquee\n\n1991 - First Recordings 1968-1971\n\n1995 - Platinum Rare\n\n2009 - Action: The Sweet Anthology\n\n\nANDY SCOTT'S SWEET ALBUMS:\n\n1992 - A\n\n1997 - Dangerous Game\n\n2002 - SweetLife (VBR)\n\n2012 - New York Connection\n\n\nBRIAN CONNOLLY'S SWEET ALBUM:\n\n1995 - Let's Go!\n\n\nSTEVE PRIEST'S SWEET ALBUM:\n\n2009 - Live!
