In this book, star financial journalist Duff McDonald shows just how, in becoming an indispensable part of decision making at the highest levels, McKinsey has done nothing less than set the course of American capitalism. \n\nBut he also answers the question thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the mind of anyone who has ever heard the word McKinsey: Are they worth it? After all, just as McKinsey can be shown to have helped invent most of the tools of modern management, the company was also involved with a number of striking failures. Its consultants were on the scene when General Motors drove itself into the ground, and they were KmartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advisers when the retailer tumbled into disarray. They played a critical role in building the bomb known as Enron.\n\nMcDonald is one of the few journalists to have not only parsed the record but also penetrated the culture of McKinsey itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€a corporate mandarin elite whose methods have been compared (by othÃ‚Â­ers and by themselves) to those of the Jesuits or the U.S. Marines. They feel so strongly about themselves that they have insisted on a proper noun where one need not exist. To an outsider, they are a consulting firm. To themselves, simply, The Firm. This revealing book uncovers the inner workings of what just might be the most influential private organization in America.\nGenre: Nonfiction Business\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0af7b084b114314e27a1d6253b5644b832c70203","amp;dn":"The+Firm_+The+Story+of+McKinsey+and+Its++-+McDonald%2C+Duff.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0af7b084b114314e27a1d6253b5644b832c70203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,247,176,132,177,20,49,78,39,161,214,37,59,86,68,184,50,199,2,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
