It'd be appreciated if some reverser more skilled than me can take a look at the serial algorithm and code a keygen. I believe the algo is located at 0x806A820.\n\nDon't ask me how I got this. Also don't ask me why the redstar guys added serial protection since redstar 2.x.\n\nThere exists an x64 version of this, but I don't have that, just the x86 version.\n\nI also do not have the desktop version, just the server version, but since this is the first ever leak of Red Star OS Server, and the first ever leak of redstar 3.0, why aren't you thanking me already?!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n~ slipstream\n\nPS: umad DPRK?\n\nIf you like this, tip me dogecoins!
