Garrard VINE VOICE\n\nBabyface was just making inroads as one of the most prolific (and profitable) songwriters of all time, and this disc shows his talent at its best. Featuring such then-chart-toppers as Aaron Hall, Johnny Gill, P.M. Dawn, Grace Jones, Shanice, and the up-and-coming Toni Braxton, the album showcases where R &amp; B was at the start of the decade.\n\n&quot;Boomerang&quot; is ear candy and a perfect fit for one's musical time capsule.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94df6f203d6064da3d37f512ac72738585b443fc","amp;dn":"Boomerang+-+Original+Soundtrack+Album+320cbr+1992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94df6f203d6064da3d37f512ac72738585b443fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,223,111,32,61,96,100,218,61,55,245,18,172,114,115,133,133,180,67,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
