They are Germany's Iron Youth who enter the war with high ideals and leave it disillusioned or dead. As Paul struggles with the realities of the man he has become, and the inscrutable world to which he must return, he is led like a ghost of his former self into the war's final hours. All Quiet is one of the greatest war novels of all time, an eloquent expression of the futility, hopelessness and irreparable losses of war.\r\n\r\n&quot;Muller's straightforward, simple delivery underscores the horror and hopelessness depicted in Remarque's powerful WWI novel. Germany's Iron Youth, represented by Paul Baumer and his friends, begin the war as teenagers sure of the justice of their cause and the glory that will be theirs. When these young men are confronted with trench warfare, dying in hellish agony, Paul must face the reality in which he finds himself and prepare for the world to which he will return, irrevocably changed. Reading with a calm, quiet sureness, which heightens the soul-destroying nightmare of Paul's ordeal, Muller's stunning performance demonstrates the reason for his huge following. Recommended by many high schools, this is a must for young adults [and old -FB].\r\n\r\nErich Maria Remarque (1898-1970) served in World War I, where he received wounds five times in battle. The searing images of trench warfare left indelible scars on Remarque, who then attempted to exorcize his demons through the writing of literature. &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; is Remarque's most memorable book, although he wrote nine others dealing with the miseries of war","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbee14a063304b09613fce744267f15f0cd02735","amp;dn":"ALL+QUIET+ON+THE+WESTERN+FRONT+-Erich+Remarque-Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbee14a063304b09613fce744267f15f0cd02735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,238,20,160,99,48,75,9,97,63,206,116,66,103,241,95,12,208,39,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
