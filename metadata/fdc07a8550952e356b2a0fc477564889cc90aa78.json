Use WINRAR to extract ( prefferably to D:ArmA2 ) - also make sure to extract additional_files.rar, they were in use when I created the main arhive and I didnt want to wait another 2h to add them\n\nStep 2. go to #JIMBOtheNOOB folder and if you have extracted the game to D:ArmA2 just run registry.reg, if not open file in notepad and replace all d:\\ArmA2 entries with ur new location..\n\nStep 3. Insert a New CD Key - run #JIMBOtheNOOBkeygen.exe to generate keys for ARMA 2 and AO (use the lower number) and put them in (run options.cmd -&gt; 1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10) but make sure u delete the spaces\n\nStep 4. Run with dayz_game.bat or server with dayz_server.bat (for lan use tunngle)\n\nStep 5. PROFIT\n\nadditional notes if you host your own server:\n-make sure you block port 29910 UDP outbound (firewall -&gt; advanced settings -&gt; outbound rules -&gt; new rule -&gt; port -&gt; UDP 29910 -&gt; Block -&gt; All Checked -&gt; Name -&gt; Done)\n-if you want to clear/spawn new vehicles use dayz_server_setup.bat (option 3)\n-to use the admin feature start the MySQL server (from dayz_server.bat option 0) then start server_setup/admin/usbwebserver.exe and then go to firefox and type localhost/admin.php or if you feel lucky localhost/phpmyadmin\n-also.. server pass is 112 (u can change it, and other stuff with dayz_server_setup.bat option 6)\n\ninfo inspired by\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdc07a8550952e356b2a0fc477564889cc90aa78","amp;dn":"Arma+2+Armored+Operations+1.62+Update+%2B+DAYZ+%2B+SERVER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdc07a8550952e356b2a0fc477564889cc90aa78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,192,122,133,80,149,46,53,107,42,15,196,119,86,72,137,204,144,170,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
