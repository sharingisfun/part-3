The text focuses on application considerations and relevant practical issues that arise in the selection and design of mechatronics components and systems. The text uses several programming languages to illustrate the key topics. Different programming platforms are presented to give instructors the choice to select the programming language most suited to their course objectives. A separate laboratory book, with additional exercises is provided to give guided hands-on experience with many of the topics covered in the text.\n\nAbout the Author\nMusa Jouaneh received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Louisiana, Lafayette in 1984 and then went on to the University of California at Berkeley where he received his M.Eng in 1986 and his Ph.D. in 1989. He is currently a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at the University of Rhode Island. His teaching interests include Mechatronics, Robotics, Real-Time Monitoring and Control, and Engineering Mechanics. Professor Jouaneh has been the recipient of several awards including URI Outstanding Contributions to Intellectual Property Award (2004),The URI Foundation Teaching Excellence Award (2003), URI Outstanding Intellectual Property Development Recognition Award (2003), The 2002-2003 Edmund and Dorothy Marshall Faculty Excellence Award in Engineering, Advisor to Merit Award Winner in the Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation Design Competition (2001 and 2002), Albert E. Carlotti Faculty Excellence Award in Engineering (1993), Graduate Fellowship, University of California at Berkeley (1984-1985).\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .xi\nCHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO MECHATRONICS . . . . . .1\nCHAPTER 2 ANALOG CIRCUITS AND COMPONENTS . . . .7\nCHAPTER 3 SEMICONDUCTOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND DIGITAL CIRCUITS . . . . . . . . . . . . . .36\nCHAPTER 4 MICROCONTROLLERS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .78\nCHAPTER 5 DATA ACQUISITION AND MICROCONTROLLER/ PC INTERFACING . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .122\nCHAPTER 6 CONTROL SOFTWARE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .153\nCHAPTER 7 SENSORS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .209\nCHAPTER 8 ACTUATORS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .259\nCHAPTER 9 FEEDBACK CONTROL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .293\nCHAPTER 10 MECHATRONICS PROJECTS . . . . . . . . . . .316\nBIBLIOGRAPHY . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .347\nANSWERS TO SELECTED PROBLEMS . . . .349\nAPPENDIX A VISUAL BASIC EXPRESS . . . . . . . . . . . . . .351\nAPPENDIX B SYSTEM RESPONSE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .370\nAPPENDIX C MATLAB SIMULATION OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .377\nAPPENDIX D 7-BIT ASCII CODE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .383\nINDEX . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .385","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18550200586af4c4409aee870ba3834aa41463e9","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Mechatronics+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18550200586af4c4409aee870ba3834aa41463e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,85,2,0,88,106,244,196,64,154,238,135,11,163,131,74,164,20,99,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
