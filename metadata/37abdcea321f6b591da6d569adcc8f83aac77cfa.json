Colin Campbell and Howard Jacobson\nEnglish | May 7, 2013 | ISBN: 1937856240 | ISBN-13: 9781937856243 , 9781937856250 | 352 pages | EPUB | 2,4 MB\n\nWhat happens when you eat an apple? The answer is vastly more complex than you imagine.\nEvery apple contains thousands of antioxidants whose names, beyond a few like vitamin C, are unfamiliar to us, and each of these powerful chemicals has the potential to play an important role in supporting our health.\n\nThey impact thousands upon thousands of metabolic reactions inside the human body. But calculating the specific influence of each of these chemicals isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t nearly sufficient to explain the effect of the apple as a whole. Because almost every chemical can affect every other chemical, there is an almost infinite number of possible biological consequences.\n\nAnd thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just from an apple.\n\nNutritional science, long stuck in a reductionist mindset, is at the cusp of a revolution. The traditional Ã¢â‚¬Å“gold standardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of nutrition research has been to study one chemical at a time in an attempt to determine its particular impact on the human body. These sorts of studies are helpful to food companies trying to prove there is a chemical in milk or pre-packaged dinners that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“goodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for us, but they provide little insight into the complexity of what actually happens in our bodies or how those chemicals contribute to our health.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37abdcea321f6b591da6d569adcc8f83aac77cfa","amp;dn":"+Whole%3A+Rethinking+the+Science+of+Nutrition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37abdcea321f6b591da6d569adcc8f83aac77cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,171,220,234,50,31,107,89,29,166,213,105,173,204,143,131,170,199,124,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
