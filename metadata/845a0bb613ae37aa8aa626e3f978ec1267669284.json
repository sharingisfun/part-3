Tolkien fantasy classic set in Middle-earth was adapted into this excellent 1978 animated feature first broadcast on television. Codirectors Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., working from a script by Romeo Muller, are faithful to Tolkien's story and for that alone they get big points. The vocal cast can't be improved upon: Orson Bean is perfect as Bilbo Baggins, the timorous hobbit who grows brave on his adventure with the wizard Gandalf (John Huston). Otto Preminger is the voice of Elvenking, Richard Boone is Smaug, Hans Conreid is Thorin, and Brother Theodore is very effective as the weird Gollum. Terrific for kids and adults alike. --Tom Keogh\n\nLanguage: English\nFile Type: AVI - H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nFile Size: 702 MB\nFile Duration: 1:17:25\nResolution: 640 x 480\nKBPS: 1065\nFPS: 23.976\nAudio: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 -- 48000Hz  192 kb/s , mono (1/0)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:845a0bb613ae37aa8aa626e3f978ec1267669284","amp;dn":"The+Hobbit+%5BDVDRip+H264+1977%5D+%7E+Smiley.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"845a0bb613ae37aa8aa626e3f978ec1267669284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,90,11,182,19,174,55,170,138,166,38,227,249,120,236,18,103,102,146,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
