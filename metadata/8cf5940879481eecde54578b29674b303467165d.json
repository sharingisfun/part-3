That is, one specific structure, characteristic, or property type at a time is discussed for all three basic material types Ã¢â‚¬â€ metals, ceramics, and polymeric materials. This order of presentation allows for the early introduction of non-metals and supports the engineer's role in choosing materials based upon their characteristics. Also discussed are new, cutting-edge materials. Using clear, concise terminology that is familiar to students, Fundamentals presents material at an appropriate level for both student comprehension and instructors who may not have a materials background\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf5940879481eecde54578b29674b303467165d","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Materials+Science+and+Engineering%2C+4E+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf5940879481eecde54578b29674b303467165d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,245,148,8,121,72,30,236,222,84,87,139,41,103,75,48,52,103,22,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
