He got his start in programming at the age of 6 when he took his first computer class at The Houston Museum of Natural Science. His first program was Ã¢â‚¬Å“choose your own adventure bookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, written in BASIC; he has fond memories of the days when software needed you to write line numbers.\n\nFast forward to about thirty years later; after deciding that computers are here to stay, Ben has made a career combining some of his favorite thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€art and coding; creating art from code. One of his favorite projects was using the GMaps API to map pathologies to chromosomes for cancer research.\n\nFascinated with mobile devices for a long time, Ben thinks that the Responsive Web is one of the most exciting, yet long time coming, new aspects of web development. He now works in a SAAS development shop and is the mobile and Responsive Web evangelist for the team.\n\nWhen heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not working on some Internet project, Ben spends his time building robots, tinkering with machines, drinking coffee, surfing, and teaching Kuk Sool martial arts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33eb55da44e86622a62d93b4ca1f8d6ae766ba1b","amp;dn":"HTML5+and+CSS3+Responsive+Web+Design+Cookbook+-+Benjamin+LaGrone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33eb55da44e86622a62d93b4ca1f8d6ae766ba1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,235,85,218,68,232,102,34,166,45,147,180,202,31,141,106,231,102,186,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
