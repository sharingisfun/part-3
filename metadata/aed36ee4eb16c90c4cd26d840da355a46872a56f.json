We did our best to match color tones to the FSX version.\n    Prepar3D 2.2: Transparent windows around the BER terminal are not always shown in the right order. Same applies here: We did our best to solve this issue and make sure it`s barely visible (if at all).\n    Prapar3D 2.2 won`t load some foglight effects around apron lightpoles when you save a flight at BER and load same flight. However all effects appear as they should when you fly in from another airport or load the airport through the airport menu, which is usually done. Bug has been reported to the Prepar3D 2.2 developer team.\n\nSystem requirements:\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator X (with SP2 or Acceleration Pack) or Lockheed Martin Prepar3D V2.2 *1)\nWindows XP / Vista / 7/ 8 (64 bit version highly recommended)\nProcessor with 3.0 GHz (Dual Core processor recommended)\n2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n3D graphics card with 512 MB (1024 MB recommended)\n.net Framework 3.5 or higher (only if you use the Aerosoft-Launcher)\nDownload-Size: 2.8 GB\nInstallations-Size: 3.2 GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aed36ee4eb16c90c4cd26d840da355a46872a56f","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+-+Aerosoft+-+Berlin+Brandenburg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aed36ee4eb16c90c4cd26d840da355a46872a56f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,211,110,228,235,22,201,12,76,210,109,132,13,163,85,164,104,114,165,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
