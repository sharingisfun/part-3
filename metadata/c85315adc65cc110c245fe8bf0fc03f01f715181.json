Use the Advanced Spill Suppressor to control the amount of green spill left in green-screen footage. \n\nLive Text Templates for Premiere Pro - Package your After Effects compositions as Live Text templates so Premiere Pro editors can change the text without changing the text color, motion, or lower-third background. \n\nFlexible masking options and Premiere Pro Interchange - Use masks to apply effects to specific areas of your compositions Ã¢â‚¬â€ no need for additional adjustment or track matte layers and blend each effect individually into the original layer. Import masks from Premiere Pro via Dynamic Link for further refinement. \n\nKuler integration - Create color themes using the Adobe Kuler app on your iPhone or in your browser, and then sync your swatches to After Effects for use in your compositions.\n\nMercury Transmit - Get full-screen previews of your composites on a separate monitor. Send previews over interfaces like HDMI from a graphics card without additional hardware.\n\nMedia Browser enhancements - Navigate your media locally or across a network via Adobe Anywhere, and access complex media types like P2 and XDCAM as media, not as nested folders.\n\nTypekit Integration - Access a variety of fonts from Typekit for immediate use in your After Effects projects. \n\nPanel Integration support - Find and install plug-ins, extensions, training media, and other content via After Effects panels created by the developer community.\n\nAnd so much more - Also includes: Faster performance in the Warp Stabilizer VFX effect; the ability to import Sony RAW footage from F5, F55, and F65 cameras; scripting access to render settings and output module settings; and more. \n\nSee full release notes :   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/whats-new.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/whats-new.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n-Multicore Intel processor with 64-bit support\n-Mac OS X v10.8 or v10.9\n-4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)\n-5 GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on a volume that uses a case-sensitive fi le system or on removable flash storage devices)\n-Additional disk space for disk cache (10 GB recommended)\n-1440 x 900 display\n-OpenGL 2.0Ã¢â‚¬â€œcapable system\n-QuickTime 7.6.6 software required for QuickTime features\n-Optional: Adobe-certifi ed GPU card for GPU-accelerated ray-traced 3D renderer\n\nLanguages : Deutsch, English, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, FranÃƒÂ§ais, Italiano, PortuguÃƒÂªs (Brasil), ÃÂ Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ¸ÃÂ¹, Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¨ÂªÅ¾, Ã­â€¢Å“ÃªÂµÂ­Ã¬â€“Â´","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c85315adc65cc110c245fe8bf0fc03f01f715181","amp;dn":"Adobe+After+Effects+CC+2014-%28MAC%29+%2864+bit%29.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c85315adc65cc110c245fe8bf0fc03f01f715181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,83,21,173,198,92,193,16,194,69,254,139,240,252,3,240,31,113,81,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
