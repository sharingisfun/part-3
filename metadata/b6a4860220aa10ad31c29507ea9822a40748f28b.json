Formed in Akron, OH, in 1972 by Kent State art students Jerry Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh, Devo took its name from their concept of &quot;de-evolution&quot; -- the idea that instead of evolving, mankind has actually regressed, as evidenced by the dysfunction and herd mentality of American society. Their music echoed this view of society as rigid, repressive, and mechanical, with appropriate touches -- jerky, robotic rhythms; an obsession with technology and electronics (the group was among the first non-prog rock bands to make the synthesizer a core element); often atonal melodies and chord progressions -- all of which were filtered through the perspectives of geeky misfits. Devo became a cult sensation, helped in part by their concurrent emphasis on highly stylized visuals, and briefly broke through to the mainstream with the smash single &quot;Whip It,&quot; whose accompanying video was made a staple by the fledgling MTV network. Sometimes resembling a less forbidding version of the Residents, Devo's simple, basic electronic pop sound proved very influential, but it was also somewhat limited, and as other bands began expanding on the group's ideas, Devo seemed unable to keep pace. After a series of largely uninteresting albums, the band called it quits early in the '90s, and Casale and Mothersbaugh concentrated on other projects.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Here To Go\n02.Through Being Cool\n03.Big Mess\n04.That's Good\n05.Jerkin' Back 'N' Forth\n06.Peek-A-Boo\n07.Beautiful World\n08.(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\n09.Whip It\n10.Girl U Want\n11.Freedom Of Choice\n12.Smart PatrolMr.DNA\n13.Gut FeelingSlap Your Mammy\n14.Gates Of Steel\n15.Working In The Coal Mine\n16.Jocko Homo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6a4860220aa10ad31c29507ea9822a40748f28b","amp;dn":"Devo+-+Greatest+Hits+%281990%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6a4860220aa10ad31c29507ea9822a40748f28b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,164,134,2,32,170,16,173,49,194,149,7,234,152,34,164,7,72,242,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
