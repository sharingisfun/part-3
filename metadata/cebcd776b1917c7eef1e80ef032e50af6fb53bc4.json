So during the course of these lessons, you'll have a chance to learn about different aspects of Maya from several of our instructors here at Digital-Tutors.\n\nDigital-Tutors is the worlds largest resource for Autodesk training, and over the years, we've had the honor and the privilege of teaching some of the top artists and studios all around the world. And for the next several hours, we'll be giving you the most structured, well-rounded and easiest to follow Maya training that you'll be able to find anywhere.\n\nIn the first portion of this tutorial, we'll be getting you familiar with some of the vocabulary and foundational skills that you'll need in order to begin moving around and working in Maya. From there, we'll move into exploring some of the modeling features found in Maya, and we'll begin building the mech that will be our central project for the remainder of this course.\n\nWe'll take you through the entire process of adding textures and materials to the mech, adding animated movement and animation controls, adding dynamics and finally we'll learn how to add lights, shadows and output our final animated sequence. \n\nThis training is designed for new Maya users, so our goal is not to weigh you down with a lot of technical information. Instead, we want you to form some really good habits and workflows Ã¢â‚¬â€œ getting to see the entire start-to-finish pipeline for this project Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and by the end of this tutorial, we want you to be at a point where you can feel very comfortable using Maya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cebcd776b1917c7eef1e80ef032e50af6fb53bc4","amp;dn":"Digital-Tutors+-+Introduction+to+Maya+2015+-+sum1_here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cebcd776b1917c7eef1e80ef032e50af6fb53bc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,188,215,118,177,145,124,126,239,30,128,239,3,46,80,175,111,181,59,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
