The band started working on the album in 2010 and finished it in 2011. All of the songs on the album were produced by Paul Epworth, who also worked prominently on the band's debut album Lungs (2009).  The album received acclaim from music critics, who drew comparisons to artists such as Kate Bush, while also praising the instrumentation, Florence Welch's vocals and the production of the songs. As a critical success, it appeared on several year-end critics' lists in late 2011. Furthermore, Ceremonials received a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album and &quot;Shake It Out&quot; received one for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Ceremonials debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the band's second consecutive number-one album in the UK. It also debuted at number one on the Australian Albums Chart and peaked at number six on the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming the band's first top ten album in the United States. English novelist Emma Forrest contributed an essay to the album, which can be found in the booklet of the CD edition.  To date, six singles have been released from Ceremonials. &quot;What the Water Gave Me&quot; was released on 23 August 2011 as a teaser for the album, along with a music video. &quot;Shake It Out&quot; was released on 30 September 2011 as the album's official lead single, becoming one of the band's most commercially successful singles to date. &quot;No Light, No Light&quot; was released on 16 January 2012 as the second official single from the album and &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; was released on 30 March 2012. &quot;Spectrum (Say My Name)&quot; was released on 5 July 2012 and, fuelled by a remix by Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, became Florence and the Machine's first number-one single in the UK. &quot;Lover to Lover&quot; was released on 30 November 2012. Ceremonials was also promoted by the band by a worldwide tour, the Ceremonials Tour (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œ12).\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Only If For A Night\n[02] Shake It Out\n[03] What The Water Gave Me\n[04] Never Let Me Go\n[05] Breaking Down\n[06] Lover To Lover\n[07] No Light, No Light\n[08] Seven Devils\n[09] Heartlines\n[10] Spectrum\n[11] All This And Heaven Too\n[12] Leave My Body\n\n\tCD Play Time - 00h:56m:22s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 137mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
