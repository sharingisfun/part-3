Fell is something of a recluse, living in a small part of a now ruined Abbey with his manservant Kenrick as the only other occupant. He remains infatuated with his late wife and is convinced that she will return to him. While all goes well when first married, he returns to his odd behavior when they return to the Abbey from their honeymoon. The memories of Ligea continue to haunt him as well as her promise that she would never die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dc18956f3455ac864eed32b8f07f7effa809556","amp;dn":"The+Tomb+of+Ligeia+%281964%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dc18956f3455ac864eed32b8f07f7effa809556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,193,137,86,243,69,90,200,100,238,211,43,143,7,247,239,250,128,149,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
