It also features a glossary of approximately 300 terms and a substance index that facilitates finding a specific application. \r\nFor this new edition the work has been now extended to two volumes, reflecting the latest developments in the technique and related instrumentation, while also incorporating several new examples of applications in many fields.\r\nThe first two editions were very well received, making this handbook a must-have in all analytical laboratories using GC-MS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:305e2c8de0d57a180a084c8575b217756e674f61","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+GC_MS+-+Fundamentals+and+Applications+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"305e2c8de0d57a180a084c8575b217756e674f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,94,44,141,224,213,122,24,10,8,76,133,117,178,23,117,110,103,79,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
