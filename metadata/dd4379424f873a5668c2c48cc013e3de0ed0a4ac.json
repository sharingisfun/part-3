Halford, &quot;The Art of Bonsai: Creation, Care and Enjoyment&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 0804820910 | 1996 | EPUB | 220 pages | 27 MB\n\nThis classic work remains an eminently practical book about bonsai, one of japan's most fascinating arts. Japanese miniature landscapes and dwarf trees have long been admired throughout the world. There is something so magical, ethereal even about their gemlike beauty that their creation has generally been thought an occult science, and even their care and preservation have seemed shrouded in mystery.\n\nAs this book proves, however, the creation and care of bonsai form a comparatively simple art which can be systematically taught and learned. Given a reasonably green thumb, a modicum of patience, and the knowledge contained in this volume, anyone can create bonsai and keep a finished plant healthy and vigorous for generations.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd4379424f873a5668c2c48cc013e3de0ed0a4ac","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Bonsai%3A+Creation%2C+Care+and+Enjoyment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd4379424f873a5668c2c48cc013e3de0ed0a4ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,67,121,66,79,135,58,86,104,194,196,140,192,19,227,222,14,208,164,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
