Capable of lessening your JPEG file sizes by up to 5x, this tool provides an efficient solution for freeing up hard drive space and shortening upload times.\nThis program is a desktop application used to reduce JPEG image file sizes in order to save hard drive space and lessen the amount of time to upload or share JPEG files.\nJPEGmini is capable of reducing the file size of a standard JPEG file, up to 28 megapixels, by up to 80% without affecting the fileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s native perceptual quality. Resolution, overall image quality, and compatibility all remain the same as the original file. This compression technique utilizes an algorithm that imitates the human visual system to ensure the overall appearance of the image remains the same while removing redundancies within the file structure without creating any perceivable aliasing or artifacting.\nThe JPEGmini technology utilizes a two-step process to first analyze the fileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s image quality and assess how much compression is possible without a perceivable reduction in quality. Secondly, the system then utilizes a unique JPEG encoder that is tailor-made to the file itself to apply standard compression techniques that still allow for consistent resolution and image quality when compared to the native file. This compression technique has been tested in accordance with the ITU BT.500 standard to deliver an unnoticeable visual difference between the original file and the JPEGmini-compressed file when viewed at 100% on a monitor or printed at 200dpi on photo paper.\nJPEG resolution (typical file size reduction)\n\n8MP or higher (70-80%)\n3-7MP (50-70%)\n1-2MP (40-60%)\nLess than 1MP (30-50%)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/6gozew7s3/JPEGmini1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/6gozew7s3/JPEGmini1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/engz6gxur/JPEGmini2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/engz6gxur/JPEGmini2.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de920b3d5afb0beb67140f616dcdcd77a1178224","amp;dn":"JPEGmini+v1.2.25.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de920b3d5afb0beb67140f616dcdcd77a1178224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,146,11,61,90,251,11,235,103,20,15,97,109,205,205,119,161,23,130,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
