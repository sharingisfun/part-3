Drawing attention to the extreme downturn in most of capitalism's old centers, the unequal growth in the its new centers, and the resurgence of a global speculative bubble, Wolffâ€”in his uniquely accessible styleâ€”makes the case that the crisis should be grasped not as a passing moment but as an evolving stage in capitalism's history.\r\nAbout the author\r\n\r\nRichard D. Wolff is Professor of Economics Emeritus, University of Massachusetts, Amherst and a Visiting Professor at the New School University in New York. Wolffâ€™s recent work has concentrated on analyzing the causes and alternative solutions to the global economic crisis. His groundbreaking book Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism inspired the creation of Democracy at Work, a nonprofit organization dedicated to showing how and why to make democratic workplaces real.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to support the author: \nhttp://www.haymarketbooks.org/pb/Capitalisms-Crisis-Deepens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:351d7a0eb728d5fe2d90e73c13b4de3a0feaca7b","amp;dn":"Capitalism%27s+Crisis+Deepens+-+Richard+D.+Wolff+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"351d7a0eb728d5fe2d90e73c13b4de3a0feaca7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,29,122,14,183,40,213,254,45,144,231,60,19,180,222,58,15,234,202,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
