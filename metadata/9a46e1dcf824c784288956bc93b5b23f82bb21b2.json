New Beginning\n\nTrapt, yet another nu-metal entry from southern California, proffers an eponymous major-label debut that is as enthusiastic as it is plagiaristic. There is an organic feel to the disc that separates it from their more angst-ridden peers, specifically those who rely on electronic gadgetry over a simple guitar-bass-drums setup, though the congenial feel fits in alongside Incubus, especially with a propensity toward pensive moments that evoke a softer image than most, one that would fit into emo if the band wasn't so obviously aesthetically a rock band; &quot;These Walls&quot; actually sounds like Nickelback at its most adult rock-radio-friendly, for example. Trapt isn't original, per se, as much as it does a good job melding its pronounced influences more seamlessly than most; the band would get a better recommendation if the record had songs that stood out a bit more.\n\n\n[b]Genre:[/b]\n\nNeo-Metal\n\n[b]Label:[/b]\n\nWarner Brothers\n\n[b]Bitrate:[/b]\n\n128kbps\n\n[b]File format:[/b]\n\nmp3\n\n[b]File size:[/b]\n\n48.9 MB\n\n[b]Tracker name/Information:[/b]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://inferno.demonoid.com:3389/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://inferno.demonoid.com:3389/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.sladinki007.net:6500/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.sladinki007.net:6500/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ddram.kicks-ass.net:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ddram.kicks-ass.net:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.prq.to/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.prq.to/announce&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a46e1dcf824c784288956bc93b5b23f82bb21b2","amp;dn":"Trapt+-+Trapt+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a46e1dcf824c784288956bc93b5b23f82bb21b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,70,225,220,248,36,199,132,40,137,86,188,147,181,178,63,130,187,33,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
