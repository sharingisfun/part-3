The nearly 100 recipes are all hearty and unfussy, and organized the way real home cooks think, with chapters for simple, healthful weekday dishes; more languorous Sunday meals; and traditional holiday fare. With hundreds of mouthwatering photographs and whimsical illustrations, this book is truly a gem.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nAlexandra Stratou, an Athens native, attended the Luis Irizar Cooking School in San SebastiÃ¡n, Spain, after graduating with a bachelor of arts from Brown University in 2006. Stratou has worked in restaurant kitchens both in Spain and Greece. She self-published the original edition of Cooking with Loula (then called Cooking to Share) through a Kickstarter campaign in 2013. Currently based in Athens, she travels the world as a chef, creating events large and small, in both public and private spheres under her brand, Cooking to Share.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\t\r\nThere Is a Land\r\nForeword\r\nIntroduction\r\nA Place to Start\r\nWeekdays\r\nSundays\r\nSummer Holidays\r\nTraditions\r\nEssential Recipes\r\nLeaps of Faith\r\nTo Kyria Loula\r\nTo Giagia Sofia\r\nEnd Note\r\nRecipe List by Time and Course\r\nIndex\r\nAbout the Author\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/9ehzd2gqd/Cooking_with_Loula_Greek_Recipes_from_My_Famil.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc71b92bb7a057ea362fd8a957315851673b6cfa","amp;dn":"Cooking+with+Loula+-+Greek+Recipes+from+My+Family+to+Yours","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc71b92bb7a057ea362fd8a957315851673b6cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,113,185,43,183,160,87,234,54,47,216,169,87,49,88,81,103,59,108,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
