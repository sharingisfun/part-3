SimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n is HIV positive and tells Laura that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination. Laura decides to reopen an orphanage for handicapped children in the location and during the opening party, SimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n calls her to show the little cabin of his friend TomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s. The busy Laura does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and SimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n vanishes.
