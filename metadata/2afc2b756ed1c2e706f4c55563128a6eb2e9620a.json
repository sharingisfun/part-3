Packed on Windows 7 x32, so it SHOULD run on XP and Vista, but might not.\n\nSome things were removed to reduce the file size (by 500mb I might add)\n-CameraRAW Support\n-Unneccessary extra fonts\n-Bridge\n-Extension Manager\n-Extra Languages\n\nTo run, just put wherever you want it to go and run it.  Moving just the .dat and .exe file without the other generated files will cause settings to reset.\n\n\nIf you have any problems just let me know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2afc2b756ed1c2e706f4c55563128a6eb2e9620a","amp;dn":"Photoshop+CS6+Portable+%28ThinApp%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2afc2b756ed1c2e706f4c55563128a6eb2e9620a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,252,43,117,110,209,194,231,6,244,197,85,99,18,138,110,178,233,98,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
