It's So Hard \n\n\nTaking the best elements of 1960s bubblegum, pop, and surf music (and even 50s rockabilly at times) and processing them through the most jaded sensibility imaginable, &quot;Psychocandy&quot; is a pivotal album in post-punk history. Classic. Every song is drenched in reverb and the knobs are stuck on ten. The guitars keen like bagpipes, squeal like tires, change into Coltrane-like lines then dissolve in clouds of white noise. Made in 1985, it still sounds fresh.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 38\nArtist: Jesus &amp; Mary Chain\nAlbum: Psychocandy\nYear: 1985\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf4072c75f23883eb65dd8f7c703b22deb93408f","amp;dn":"The+Jesus+and+Mary+Chain+-+Psychocandy+%5BFLAC-1985%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf4072c75f23883eb65dd8f7c703b22deb93408f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,64,114,199,95,35,136,62,182,93,216,247,199,3,178,45,235,147,64,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
