KMFDM has released eighteen studio albums and two dozen singles, with sales of more than two million records worldwide.\n\nThe band has undergone many line-up changes and featured dozens of guest musicians. Its earliest incarnation included German drummer En Esch and British vocalist Raymond Watts, the latter of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history. German guitarist GÃƒÂ¼nter Schulz joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999. Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 (Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin), and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line-up that included American singer Lucia Cifarelli, British guitarists Jules Hodgson and Steve White, and British drummer Andy Selway.\n\nCritics consider KMFDM to be one of the first bands to bring industrial music to mainstream audiences, though Konietzko refers to the band's music as &quot;The Ultra-Heavy Beat&quot;. The band incorporates heavy metal guitar riffs, electronic music, samples, and both male and female vocals in its music, which encompasses a variety of styles. KMFDM normally tours at least once after every major release, and band members are known for their accessibility to and interaction with fans, both online and at concerts. Members, singly or working with each other and others, have recorded under many other names, primarily Watts' Pig in 1988, Konietzko's Excessive Force in 1991, and Esch and Schulz's Slick Idiot in 2001.\n\nimage\n\nBand Members\n\nSascha Konietzko Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar, bass, programming, keyboards, synthesizer, percussion\nLucia Cifarelli Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, keyboards\nJules Hodgson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, bass, keyboards\nAndy Selway Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nSteve White Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nOpium (1984)\nWhat Do You Know, Deutschland?
