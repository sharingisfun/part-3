One of the biggest bangs ever heard in fact. Around 3600 BC a big volcano exploded leaving a caldera that is partly above sea level and that is what is now known as Santorini. \n\nIt is clear there was an advanced civilization before the volcano exploded but finding remains is hard because of the turn of events. The volcano is not dead. In the middle of the caldera is a new volcano that slowly grows. As recent as 1950 there was a major eruption (even in this scenery project, just set the date to 1950). ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s now an attractive holiday destination, both for people who stay there a while or people who visit on the many cruise liners that stop there.\n\nBecause of the stunning setting and the surprising layout it was an obvious choice for a scenery project and we are happy that Mat Dalton decided it for us. It a great place to fly to in an airliner and then use a helicopter or small aircraft to explore the other side of the island.\n\nFeatures:\n\nCovers the whole island with photo textures and 10 meter mesh\nVery extensive autogen\nFull detailed coverage of Santorini Thira airport\nFully compatible with AI Traffic add-ons\nExtensive animations\nDX10 compatible\n\n\nSystem requirements:\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator X with SP2 or Acceleration Pack\nWindows XP / Vista / Windows 7 (fully updated)\n2.4 GHz Prozessor (Intel Core 2 Duo highly recommended)\n2 GB RAM\nGraphics card with 256 MB (512 MB highly recommended)\nAcrobat Reader to read the manual\nDownload-Size: 241 MB\nInstallations-Size: 310 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9937a8e8a561c18026cd7f0523e886d5241fd17","amp;dn":"FSX+-+Aerosoft+Santorini+X+V1.00","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9937a8e8a561c18026cd7f0523e886d5241fd17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,147,122,142,138,86,28,24,2,108,215,240,82,62,136,109,82,65,253,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
