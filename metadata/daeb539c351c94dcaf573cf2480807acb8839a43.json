Endgame has always been a possibility, but never a realityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until now. Twelve meteorites have just struck Earth, each \nmeteorite containing a message for a Player who has been trained for this moment. At stake for the Players: saving their bloodline, \nas well as the fate of the world. And only one can win.\nEndgame is real. Endgame is now. Endgame has begun.\nGoogle Niantic is building a mobile location-based augmented reality videogame inextricably tied to the books and mythology, a \nmajor prize will be tied to a puzzle in each book, and Twentieth Century Fox has bought the movie rights.\nRead the Books. Find the Clues. Solve the Puzzle. Who will Win?\n\n\n\nAuthors:  James Frey, Nils Johnson-Shelton\nFormats:   EPUB, MOBI, PDF, AZW3, LIT\nTags:   Thriller &amp; Suspense, Teens, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy\nPublisher:   HarperCollins (October 7, 2014)\nPrint Length:   480 pages \nLanguage:   English\nASIN:   B00HU5NEQK\nISBN-10:   0062332589\nISBN-13:   978-0062332585\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:70.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
