Rife with tales of scheming bankers, greedy politicians, sex-crazed priests, bloody rivalries, vicious intolerance, rampant disease, and lives of extravagance and excess, this gripping exploration of the underbelly of Renaissance Italy shows that, far from being the product of high-minded ideals, the sublime monuments of the Renaissance were created by flawed and tormented artists who lived in an ever-expanding world of inequality, dark sexuality, bigotry, and hatred.\nThe Ugly Renaissance is a delightfully debauched journey through the surprising contradictions of ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past and shows that were it not for the profusion of depravity and degradation, historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest masterpieces might never have come into being.\n\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction: Between Heaven and Earth\nI THE WORLD OF THE RENAISSANCE ARTIST\n1.
