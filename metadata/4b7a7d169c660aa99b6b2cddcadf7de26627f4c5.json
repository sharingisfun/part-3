Love triangles, the pursuit of the precious violin, and the need for beautiful music shoot through The House of Silence.\r\n\r\nThe love of music the characters share is tempered by ambition, envy, and greed, which crescendo on the evening of a memorial concert in Berlin, when the presence of an elderly lady in the audience makes some members of the orchestra very nervous. Who is the rightful owner of this exquisite violin? And, as secrets come to light, how far will people go to seek revenge?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b7a7d169c660aa99b6b2cddcadf7de26627f4c5","amp;dn":"The+House+of+Silence%3A+A+Novel+%282016%29+%5BWWRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b7a7d169c660aa99b6b2cddcadf7de26627f4c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,122,125,22,156,102,10,169,155,107,44,221,202,223,125,226,102,39,244,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
