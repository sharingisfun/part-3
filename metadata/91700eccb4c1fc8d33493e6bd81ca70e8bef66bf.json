This is the authorized adaptation of George Lucas's rough-draft screenplay of what would eventually become a motion picture that would change the world.\n\nAnnikin Starkiller is the hero... Luke Skywalker is a wizened Jedi general... Han Solo is a big green alien... and the Sith... well, the Sith are still the bad guys.
