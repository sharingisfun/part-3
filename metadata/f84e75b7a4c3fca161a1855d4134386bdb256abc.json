After decoding the message, NASA builds a large machine that was described in blueprints contained within the message. Ellie's slimey boss, played by Tom Skerritt, is selected to be the designated passenger in the machine, but the test-launch is sabotaged by a religious lunatic, killing Skerritt and destroying the machine. Luckily, there is a second machine, secretly built in Japan, and Ellie is chosen to man it. She ends up taking the ride of her life.\n\n  Starring: Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerritt, Jena Malone, Geoffrey Blake, William Fichtner.\n\n  Directed by: Robert Zemeckis.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  2hr.  30min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x  320\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f84e75b7a4c3fca161a1855d4134386bdb256abc","amp;dn":"Contact+%281997%29+%28Jodie+Foster%2C+Matthew+McConaughey%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f84e75b7a4c3fca161a1855d4134386bdb256abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,78,117,183,164,195,252,161,97,161,133,93,65,52,56,107,219,37,106,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
