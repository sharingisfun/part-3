No formal classroom is required; a desire to read and learn will suffice. There are countless important books to consider, but the following are an excellent starting point: The Law by FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric Bastiat; Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt; What has Government Done to our Money? by Murray Rothbard; The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek; and Economics for Real People by Gene Callahan.\nIf you simply read and comprehend these relatively short texts, you will know far more than most educated people about economics and government. You certainly will develop a far greater understanding of how supposedly benevolent government policies destroy prosperity. If you care about the future of this country, arm yourself with knowledge and fight back against economic ignorance. We disregard economics and history at our own peril.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Ron Paul, Representative from Texas ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cec0ab79e831ad27b6cad95059cfe4b128d4506","amp;dn":"Economics+in+One+Lesson%3A+The+Shortest+and+Surest+Way+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cec0ab79e831ad27b6cad95059cfe4b128d4506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,236,10,183,158,131,26,210,123,108,173,149,5,156,254,75,18,141,69,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
