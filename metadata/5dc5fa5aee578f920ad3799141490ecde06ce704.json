Despite the billions of \ndollars of funding and research into new so-called \ncures we continue to suffer from a raft of chronic \nills and every day maladies. Patching up an    \nover-toxic and over-indulgent population with a host \nof toxic therapies and nutrient sparse foods is     \ndefinitely not helping the situation.              \n\nIn a personal quest of discovery James and          \nLaurentine together with a ?lm crew and the          \neditorial and production expertise of Enzo Tedeschi  \nhave set out on an independent mission to uncover    \nthe wholesome truth. The filmmakers have interviewed \nseveral world leaders in nutrition and natural       \nhealing who claim that not only are we harming our   \nbodies with improper nutrition, but that the right   \nkind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be \nused to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as          \nterminally diagnosed cancer.                         \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Food Matters' seeks to uncover the business of      \ndisease and at the same time explore the safe, cheap \nand effective use of nutrition and supplementation   \nfor preventing and often reversing the underlying    \ncausative aspects of the illness. With the premise   \nof the film being: access to solid information helps \npeople invariably make better choices for their      \nhealth.                                              \n\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Food Matters' duo have independently funded the \nfilm from start to finish in order to remain as      \nunbiased as possible, delivering a clear and concise \nmessage to the world.
