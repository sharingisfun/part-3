ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ this handbook a truly unique and indispensable information source, a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“must-haveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for any engineerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book shelf. The book is of particular help for materials engineers in showing the cross-links to all important key-topics of mechanical engineering.&quot; (MaterialprÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼fung Materials Testing, Vol. 51 (3), 2009)\n&quot;This massive volume, edited by Grote ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and Antonsson (Caltech), and including 92 contributors, is the most up-to-date and most representative of the state-of-the-art in many broad areas encompassed by the field of mechanical engineering. The book contains three parts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ . The usefulness of this handbook is hampered by its skimpy index ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ it has many attributes that make it an important addition to the reference shelf of any library serving a mechanical engineering department. Summing Up: Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduate through professional collections.&quot; (A. M. Strauss, Choice, Vol. 47 (1), September, 2009)\nProduct Description\nEncyclopedias describe Mechanical Engineering as a professional engineering discipline that involves the application of principles of physics for analysis, design, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems. It requires a solid understanding of key concepts including mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics and energy. Mechanical engineers use these principles and others for example in the design and analysis of automobiles, aircrafts, heating and cooling systems, industrial equipment and machinery. In addition to these main areas, specialized fields are offered at universities to prepare future engineers for their position in industry, such as: mechatronics and robotics, transportation and logistics, cryogenics, fuel technology, automotive engineering, biomechanics, vibration, optics and others.\nAccordingly, the Springer Handbook of Mechanical Engineering devotes its contents to these areas of interest for the practicing engineer as well as for the student at various levels and educational institutions.\nAuthors from all over the world have contributed with their expertise and support the globally working engineer in finding a solution for todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mechanical engineering problems.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 1580 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 1 edition (February 27, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3540491317\nISBN-13: 978-3540491316\n\n[poly-technic.blogspot]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e31305fe4ab94e5b3c9fc4f453ef22d29a23bc3","amp;dn":"Springer+Handbook+of+Mechanical+Engineering+by+Ajyan%2C+Schadler+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e31305fe4ab94e5b3c9fc4f453ef22d29a23bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,49,48,95,228,171,148,229,179,201,252,79,69,62,242,45,41,162,59,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
