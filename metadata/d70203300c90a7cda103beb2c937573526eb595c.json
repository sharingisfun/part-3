The band's original lineup - vocalist/organist Mark Stein, bassist/vocalist Tim Bogert, lead guitarist/vocalist Vince Martell, and drummer/vocalist Carmine Appice - recorded five albums during the years 1967-69, before disbanding in 1970. The band has reunited in various configurations over the years, and is currently operating with its four original members. The band has been cited as, &quot;one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal.&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d70203300c90a7cda103beb2c937573526eb595c","amp;dn":"Vanilla+Fudge-11+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d70203300c90a7cda103beb2c937573526eb595c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,2,3,48,12,144,167,205,161,3,190,178,201,55,87,53,38,235,89,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
