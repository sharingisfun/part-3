Therefore we have decided to let our work, which is OUR work, \n be as clean and direct as you can get it.                               \n                                                                         \n Time went by, and The Leading Force wasn't living up to being The       \n Leading Force on the outside, then we do keep on working on &quot;something&quot; \n within the group.

Yet those API calls are inside the CODEX emulation dlls.  \n                                                                         \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.anonimg.com/img/831caf16ec0951cf88f9749b1fd569fa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.anonimg.com/img/831caf16ec0951cf88f9749b1fd569fa.jpg&lt;/a&gt;         \n                                                                         \n Link above show one, out of many proofs of stolen code. It shows the    \n original function written by the coder, using a global variable for     \n another function. Basicially the way the coder wrote the API, to set    \n the flag is unique, and simply copy and paste of our code by CODEX.     \n                                                                         \n To finalize their CODEX stupidity - they set the wrong parameter for    \n &quot;CreateFile&quot; API when it comes to &quot;folders&quot;. We do use &quot;GENERIC_READ&quot;,  \n cause of an important point, Windows simply don`t allow &quot;GENERIC_ALL&quot;   \n without admin rights.                                                   \n                                                                         \n End of story!                                                           \n                                                                         \n\n RELEASE NOTES                                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                         \n Take on an unlimited array of platform-racing challenges in the unreal  \n world of Trials Fusion.
