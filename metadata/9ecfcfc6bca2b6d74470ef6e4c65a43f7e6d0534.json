Face the Music is the shocking, funny, smart, inspirational story of one of rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most enduring icons and the group he helped create, define, \n\nand immortalize.\n\nStanley mixes compelling personal revelations and gripping, gritty war stories that will surprise even the most steadfast member of the KISS Army. He takes us back to his \n\nchildhood in the 1950s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s, a traumatic time made more painful thanks to a physical deformity. Born with a condition called microtia, he grew up partially deaf, with only \n\none ear. But this instilled in him an inner drive to succeed in the most unlikely of pursuits: music.\n\nWith never-before-seen photos and images throughout, StanleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir is a fully realized and unflinching portrait of a rock star, a chronicle of the stories behind the famous \n\nanthems, the many brawls and betrayals, and all the drama and pyrotechnics on and off the stage. Raw and confessional, Stanley offers candid insights into his personal \n\nrelationships, and the turbulent dynamics with his bandmates over the past four decades. And no one comes out unscathedÃ¢â‚¬â€including Stanley himself.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“People say I was brave to write such a revealing book, but I wrote it because I needed to personally reflect on my own life. I know everyone will see themselves somewhere in \n\nthis book, and where my story might take them is why IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sharing it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Paul Stanley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ecfcfc6bca2b6d74470ef6e4c65a43f7e6d0534","amp;dn":"Face+the+Music%2C+A+Life+Exposed-+Paul+Stanley+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ecfcfc6bca2b6d74470ef6e4c65a43f7e6d0534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,207,207,198,188,162,182,215,68,112,239,110,76,101,164,63,126,109,5,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
