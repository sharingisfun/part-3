The four pieces included in this ebook bundleÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four: The Transfer,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four: The Initiate,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four: The Son,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four: The TraitorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€give readers an electrifying glimpse into the history and heart of Tobias, and set the stage for the epic saga of the Divergent trilogy.\n\n Two years before Beatrice Prior made her choice, the sixteen-year-old son of AbnegationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faction leader did the same. TobiasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transfer to Dauntless is a chance to begin again. Here, he will not be called the name his parents gave him. Here, he will not let fear turn him into a cowering child.\n\n Newly christened Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he discovers during initiation that he will succeed in Dauntless. Initiation is only the beginning, though; Four must claim his place in the Dauntless hierarchy. His decisions will affect future initiates as well as uncover secrets that could threaten his own futureÃ¢â‚¬â€and the future of the entire faction system.\n\n Two years later, Four is poised to take action, but the course is still unclear. The first new initiate who jumps into the net might change all that. With her, the way to righting their world might become clear. With her, it might become possible to be Tobias once again.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c868cf6e6ff90e522d697dd595c9d2ac3dc8fb20","amp;dn":"Veronica+Roth+-+Four+Divergent+Stories+-+Omnibus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c868cf6e6ff90e522d697dd595c9d2ac3dc8fb20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,104,207,110,111,249,14,82,45,105,125,213,149,201,210,172,61,200,251,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
