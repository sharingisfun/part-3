Michael and his colleague Dr. Lillian Reynolds, the lead\nresearchers, have just had a breakthrough on their now ten year old project,\nTriad, where they can transfer senses - touch, smell, taste, sight and sound\n- experienced by one person to another via transfer of brainwaves. They can\nrecord the brainwaves for later use. The next step in the project is to\ncreate a more user friendly apparatus instead of the now bulky and heavy\nheadgear required, Karen who is assigned head of the design team. But as\nMichael and Lillian work more on the project, they learn that they can also\ntransfer emotional experiences from person to person. The industrial military\ncomplex is ultimately able to hijack the project from Michael and Lillian\nwith Alex's seeming blessing, the military who wants to use it for purposes\nnot part of the original vision that Lillian, Michael and Alex had. That\nnew military vision includes brainwashing and torture. The project team,\nled by Michael and Karen, try to sabotage the work of the military before\nMichael and Lillian's work can be used for these less than ethical purposes.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Christopher Walken.\n=&gt;-Natalie Wood.\n=&gt;-Louise Fletcher.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Douglas Trumbull.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Sci-Fi : Thriller.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1983.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.32 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 784 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 46mn.\n=&gt;-Brainstorm.................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003017-brainstorm/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.40:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 536.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1666 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 212 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718d778e862497845168de7f5f60c24b3972127a","amp;dn":"Brainstorm+-+Christopher+Walken+Sci-Fi+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718d778e862497845168de7f5f60c24b3972127a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,141,119,142,134,36,151,132,81,104,222,127,95,96,194,75,57,114,18,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
