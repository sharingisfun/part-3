Soulsavers the music and production team of Rich Machin and Ian Glover have been a growing force since 2003 s debut Tough Guys Don t Dance.\nVenturing out from the studio to the road, Soulsavers were invited to support Depeche Mode on the European leg of their vast and eventful 2009-10 Tour Of The Universe, during which tour Dave Gahan bounced back from more than his fair share of illness and injury. Here, the seeds of The Light The Dead See were sewn.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f08de21ed696c43eeb4499b64a09b57d737cf1","amp;dn":"Soulsavers+-+The+Light+The+Dead+See+%5Bmp3-320-2012%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f08de21ed696c43eeb4499b64a09b57d737cf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,240,141,226,30,214,150,196,62,235,68,153,182,74,9,181,125,115,124,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
