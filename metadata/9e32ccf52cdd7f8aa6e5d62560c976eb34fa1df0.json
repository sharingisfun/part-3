SENSATION AND PERCEPTION has helped many readers understand the ties between how we sense the world and how the body interprets these senses. A key strength of this book has always been the ability to illustrate concepts through examples and visuals. Dr. Goldstein walks you through an intriguing journey of the senses, combining clear writing, his extensive classroom experience, and innovative research to create a visual, colorful book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e32ccf52cdd7f8aa6e5d62560c976eb34fa1df0","amp;dn":"Sensation+and+Perception%2C+9E-+Goldstein+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e32ccf52cdd7f8aa6e5d62560c976eb34fa1df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,50,204,245,44,221,127,138,166,229,214,37,96,201,118,235,52,250,29,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
