You decide the combat role you want to assume\nin the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind s last\nrefuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields,\nextensive customization options, and an innovative control system that\nwill keep you coming back for more.\n\nBrink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the\nbrink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental,\nself-sufficient and 100%  green  habitat, the reported rapid rise of\nthe Earth s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the\noriginal founders and their descendants but also to thousands of\nrefugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and\nResistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark.\nbWhich side will you choose?\n\nFeatures:\n\nNot Just Another Hero  Brink's advanced player customization offers a\nnear-endless combination of looks for your character  allowing for the\nappearance of your character to be truly unique. As you progress\nthrough the game and acquire more experience, you ll have even more\nopportunities for customization.\n\nTwo Sides to Every Story  Choose to fight through the single player\ncampaign as either a member of the Resistance or the Security and then\ntake your same character online to play cooperatively or competitively\nagainst other players.\n\nBlurring the Lines  Take your unique character online at any time you\nchoose! Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player\ncampaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action.\nMultiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven\nother people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the\nopposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.\n\n\nPlay SMART  Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you re used\nto, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature:\nthe SMART button. When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically\nevaluates where you re trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether\nyou re a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you ll\nbe able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action\nwith SMART.\n\nContext-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications,\nmissions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based\non your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the\noverall status of the battle in all gameplay modes. You ll always know\nexactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your\nreward will be for success.\n\n\n INSTALL NOTES\n\n2. Mount or burn image\n3. Install\n4.
