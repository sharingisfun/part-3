But Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rides AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a lot looser in its attack, something reflected in how it splits the difference between country and rockabilly classics and reflective numbers from '70s songwriters. \n\n\nJohn Fogerty\n\nCD 1: The Blue Ridge Rangers, 1973\n\nCD 2: The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again, 2009\n\n\n 2 CDs / 1991, 2009 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1 / Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Blue Ridge RangersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: \n\n \n1.
