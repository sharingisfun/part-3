This new installer contains the latest patch which is 1.0e. Hope you guys enjoy and please help seed.\n\n\n------------------\n\n\nChanges for 1.0E: \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢NEW: Controller option allows disabling all controller use in game. \nIntended for players who might prefer to use external gamepad mapping \ntools -- weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll continue to support as many input devices as we possibly can! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢NEW: Feat progress is immediately saved upon unlocking. Previously, \nFeats could be unlocked but lost by the regular saving mechanisms if a \ngame exited or turned off before reaching an autosave point. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢NEW:Direction inputs can be bound to multiple buttons--just press more \nthan one input at once. Intended for players who wanted to map Shovel \nDrop to its own button. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Removed an Ã¢â‚¬Å“emptyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Song Scroll from Clockwork Tower which could \nnever be collected or turned in. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reflect Lord FeatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ only incrementing enemies hit count if it the \nreflected attack was non-fatal. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: DualShock button prompts not auto-detecting. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Treasure Knight getting caught on walls during vertical downward \nanchor shots. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Player could retreat to the previous screen during Specter \nKnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battle. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: (Alchemy Lab) Sound would loop forever if the Potion Master mid \nboss was defeated at a certain frame \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: (Tower: ????) Soft lock fix involving NPC AI. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Double KO end to a boss battles disabled access to pause and relic \nmenus. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Potential Fix: LogitechWingmanRumblepad controller bindings. Please let \nus know if you are still experiencing issues with any device! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Additional controller support. Thank You to everyone who submitted \ntheir devices! \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Ã¢â‚¬Å“HalfwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Feat unlocking when re-clearing a stage. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Black Knight ignores damage during Plains intro. For some players, \nthere was a small window of opportunity to Ground Spark which could \ncause Black Knight to go off script. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Sparker Feat not unlocking when defeating Black Knight. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Player and Encounter Map movement halting the game under certain \nvsync/video settings. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Fix: Monitors running higher than 60hz running at double speed or faster \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4fe20da0172cb65be9988c9982849fc494fd680","amp;dn":"Shovel+Knight+%28GOG%29+%28Latest+With+1.0E+Patch%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4fe20da0172cb65be9988c9982849fc494fd680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,254,32,218,1,114,203,101,190,153,136,201,152,40,73,252,73,79,214,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
