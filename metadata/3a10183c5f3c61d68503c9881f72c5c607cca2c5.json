You hear a gurgling sound. Is it the undead? NoÃ¢â‚¬â€it's your stomach.\nWhen the zombie apocalypse tears down life and society as we know it, it will mean no more take out, no more brightly lit, immaculately organized aisles of food just waiting to be plucked effortlessly off the shelves. No more trips down to the local farmers' market. No more microwaved meals in front of the TV or intimate dinner parties. No, when the undead rise, eating will be hard, and doing it successfully will become an art.\nThe Art of Eating through the Zombie Apocalypse is a cookbook and culinary field guide for the busy zpoc survivor. With more than 80 recipes (from Overnight of the Living Dead French Toast and It's Not Easy Growing Greens Salad to Down &amp; Out Sauerkraut, Honey &amp; Blackberry Mead, and Twinkie Trifle), scads of gastronomic survival tips, and dozens of diagrams and illustrations that help you scavenge, forage, and improvise your way to an artful post-apocalypse meal. The Art of Eating is the ideal handbook for efficient food sourcing and inventive meal preparation in the event of an undead uprising.\nWhether you decide to hole up in your own home or bug out into the wilderness, whether you prefer to scavenge the dregs of society or try your hand at apocalyptic agriculture, and regardless of your level of skill or preparation, The Art of Eating will help you navigate the wasteland and make the most of what you eat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a10183c5f3c61d68503c9881f72c5c607cca2c5","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Eating+through+the+Zombie+Apocalypse+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a10183c5f3c61d68503c9881f72c5c607cca2c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,16,24,60,95,60,97,214,133,3,201,136,31,114,197,198,7,204,162,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
