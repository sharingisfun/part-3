It's stunningly beautiful and an ideal location to relax.\nCovering more than 4,000 sqkm the North- and South-MalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨-Atolls are huge but the actual area of usable land is minute, and most holiday infrastructure is actually build on the water. It was also sadly missing in FSX, something one of our best designers solved with Maldives X, The MalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ Atolls.\nEven when the weather outside is dark and grim these islands will bask in glorious sunshine on your screen. As you explore the many islands in a sea plane (or even better, an amphibian like our Twin Otter or Catalina) you will see why this has been such a popular holiday destination for many who could afford it. But do take care, when the weather turns for the worst the lack of navigation stations means you could easily miss an island you were heading for and find yourself lost over the Indian Ocean. Of course you first need to get to the islands and that means serious long distance flight from any of the many airports worldwide that got direct connections to this very strange airport that's got an island of its own!\nFeatures:\n Covers the main islands of the Maldives\n Male International airport in great detail\n Hundreds of lagoons and islands to explore\n All tourist locations included\n Very good framerates\n High definition chart included\n Ideally suitable for amphibian aircraft\nAdditional Downloads:\n .pdf-Manual (English) : &gt;&gt; Click here &lt;&lt;\n High definition chart: &gt;&gt; Click here &lt;&lt;\nSystem requirements for FSX:\n Microsoft Flight Simulator X SP2 (or Acceleration)\n Windows XP / Vista / 7\n 2.0 Ghz Processor (Intel Core 2 Duo highly recommended)\n 2 GB RAM internal memory\n 256 MB graphic card (512 Mb highly recommended)\n PDF reader for manual","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00c6c251e8619ec9fa2228a0e6b8720490b0526c","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Aerosoft+-+Maldives+X+-+The+Mal%26Atilde%3B%26uml%3B+Atolls+v1.02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00c6c251e8619ec9fa2228a0e6b8720490b0526c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,198,194,81,232,97,158,201,250,34,40,160,230,184,114,4,144,176,82,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
