The text emphasizes immediate application of critical-thinking skills to real life. The relevance of these skills is shown throughout the text by highlighting the advantages of basing one's decisions on a thoughtful understanding of arguments and presenting the overarching commonalities across arguments. With its conversational writing style and carefully selected examples, the book employs a consistent and unified treatment of logical form and an innovative semiformal method of standardizing arguments that illustrates the concept of logical form while maintaining a visible connection to ordinary speech. Without sacrificing accuracy or detail, the authors have clearly presented the material with appropriate study tools and exercises that emphasize application rather than memorization.\n\n\nPaperback: 464 pages\nPublisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 1 edition (January 1, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0495501573\nISBN-13: 978-0495501572","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e551265bc440c4c8c3f64d643f0d586c18686e","amp;dn":"Critical+Thinking+-+The+Art+of+Argument+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e551265bc440c4c8c3f64d643f0d586c18686e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,229,81,38,91,196,64,196,200,195,246,77,100,63,13,88,108,24,104,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
