Milwaukee resident Kent Knapp is trying to keep it alive and pass the skill on to his three sons. Kent and his family run a blacksmith shop in the blue-collar city, where they use a 100-year-old screw press and 135-year-old anvil to help them get the jobs done for their clients. If someone needs a large steel object forged, whether itÃ¢Â€â„¢s a bank vault or a bike frame, they go to Kent, who has built his business from the ground up.\r\n\r\nSeason 01, Episode 01 â€“ â€œThe Forge Awakensâ€\r\nA blacksmith and his children carry on the craft of blacksmithing in this reality series that opens with an order for a Death Star firepit.\r\n\r\nSeason 01, Episode 02 â€“ â€œBrewed Forceâ€\r\nThe Knapps build a giant steel beer bottle for the annual Brewfest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:754a518d539dbe57d88722ce16827cb896dd41e0","amp;dn":"Milwaukee+Blacksmith+S01E01-E02+HDTV+x264-SDI%5Bstate%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"754a518d539dbe57d88722ce16827cb896dd41e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,74,81,141,83,157,190,87,216,135,34,206,22,130,124,184,150,221,65,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
