With &quot;TRILOGY&quot; (out May 2016) Ana releases three albums in one! Twenty-three blues, jazz &amp; funk tunes produced by Grammy Award winner Warren Riker (Lauryn Hill, Carlos Santana), Grammy Award winner Tom Hambridge (Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi) and Delfeayo Marsalis, one of the top trombonists, composers and producers in jazz today. Guest appearances include Joe Bonamassa, Robert Randolph, Bernard Purdie (The Purdie Shuffle), Cody Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars), rapper Al Capone and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n The only female guitarist part of the 'all-star' Experience Hendrix '14 and '16 line-up about her upcoming record: In an era where most are skeptic about the current state and future of the music industry, I wanted TRILOGY to tell a different story. The record biz might be broken and Spotify might rip us off, but that can't keep an artist down. Creativity is very much alive, and music is the celebration of life.\r\n\r\n TRILOGY highlights in musicianship. Ana's agile shredding and soulful voice, showing you donâ€™t need Southern roots to create fiery blues, jazz or funk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9956542385092608389cb3abbbeb9389b323e8e9","amp;dn":"Ana+Popovic+-+Trilogy+%282016%29+3CD+Box-Set+CDDA+CD+Rip+%2F+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9956542385092608389cb3abbbeb9389b323e8e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,86,84,35,133,9,38,8,56,156,179,171,187,235,147,137,179,35,232,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
