Woolfson was a lawyer by profession, but also a composer and pianist. Parsons was a successful producer and accomplished engineer. Almost all songs on the band's albums are credited to &quot;Woolfson/Parsons&quot;.Englishman Alan Parsons met Scotsman Eric Woolfson in the canteen of Abbey Road Studios in the summer of 1974. Parsons had already acted as assistant engineer on The Beatles' Abbey Road and Let It Be, had recently engineered Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, and had produced several acts for EMI Records. Woolfson, a songwriter and composer, was working as a session pianist; he had also composed material for a concept album idea based on the work of Edgar Allan Poe.Parsons asked Woolfson to become his manager and Woolfson managed Parsons' career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes including Pilot, Steve Harley, Cockney Rebel, John Miles, Al Stewart, Ambrosia and The Hollies. Parsons commented at the time that he felt frustrated in having to accommodate the views of some of the musicians, which he felt interfered with his production. Woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the film industry, where directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick were the focal point of the film's promotion, rather than individual film stars. If the film industry was becoming a director's medium, Woolfson felt the music business might well become a producer's medium.Recalling his earlier Edgar Allan Poe material, Woolfson saw a way to combine his and Parsons' respective talents. Parsons would produce and engineer songs written by the two, and the Alan Parsons Project was born.\n\n.: Eric Woolfson &amp; Alan Parsons :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img714.imageshack.us/img714/5600/alanparson.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img714.imageshack.us/img714/5600/alanparson.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1976 Tales Of Mystery And Imagination (Deluxe Edition 2007, 2 CD) @320\\CD1 Deluxe Edition 2007\n1976 Tales Of Mystery And Imagination (Deluxe Edition 2007, 2 CD) @320\\CD2 Deluxe Edition 1987 Remix\n1977 I Robot (Expanded Edition 2007) @320\n1978 Pyramid (Expanded Edition 2008) @320\n1979 Eve (Expanded Edition 2008) @320\n1980 The Turn Of A Friendly Card (Expanded Edition 2008) @320\n1982 Eye In The Sky (Expanded Edition 2007) @320\n1984 Ammonia Avenue (Expanded Edition 2008) @320\n1985 Stereotomy (Expanded Edition 2008) @320\n1985 Vulture Culture (Expanded Edition 2007) @320\n\nCompilation albums\n1983 The Best Of The Alan Parsons Project @320\n1987 The Best of The Alan Parsons Project Vol 2 @320\n1988 The Instrumental Works @320\n1989 Pop Classics @320\n1991 The Best Of The Alan Parsons Vol 3 (2 CD)@320\n1995 The Very Best Live @320\n2003 Silence &amp; I - The Very Best Of (3 CD)@320\n2006 Days Are Numbers (3 CD)@320\n2007 The Essential Alan Parsons Project (Remastered, 3 CD) @320\n\nLive albums\n1994 Alan Parsons Live @320\n1995 Riverbend Music Theatre @320\n\nAlan Parsons solo albums\n1993 Try Anything Once @320\n1996 On Air @320\n1999 The Time Machine @320\n2004 A Valid Path @320\n2005 Eye 2 Eye - Live in Madrid @320\n\nEric Woolfson solo albums\n1987 Gaudi (Expanded Edition 2008) @320\n1990 Freudiana @320\n1996 Gambler @VBR\n2008 More Tales Of Mystery And Imagination @320\n2009 Alan Parsons Project That Never Was @320\n\nOther albums\n1983 Andrew Powell and the Philharmonia Orchestra play the best of the Alan Parsons Project @320\n2004 Excalibur (Michael Ernst with Alan Parsons &amp; Chris Thompson) @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5566687cbe2e690a108686654161e0176950f9a7","amp;dn":"The+Alan+Parsons+Project+-+Discography+1976-2009+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5566687cbe2e690a108686654161e0176950f9a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,102,104,124,190,46,105,10,16,134,134,101,65,97,224,23,105,80,249,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
