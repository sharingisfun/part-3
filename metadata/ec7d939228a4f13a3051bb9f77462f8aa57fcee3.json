The album includes guest performances by Shania Twain on &quot;White Christmas&quot; and The Puppini Sisters on &quot;Jingle Bells.&quot; BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© also put his unique take on such classics as &quot;Silent Night,&quot; &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,&quot; &quot;It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming To Town.&quot; In addition, a BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© original &quot;Cold December Night&quot; will be included on Christmas.\n\n [img]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/img]\n01.
