Saghyan, Peter Langer (Wiley-VCH, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nAuthored by two internationally recognized experts with an excellent track record, this much-needed reference summarizes latest research in the rapidly developing field of stereoselective synthesis of enantiomerically enriched amino acids, particularly of non-proteinogenic origin. It highlights several different catalytic and stoichiometric asymmetric methods for their synthesis and also provides information on origin, biological properties, different synthetic strategies and important applications in medicine and pharmacology. \r\nEssential reading for synthetic chemists working in the field of asymmetric synthesis, natural products and peptide synthesis, stereochemistry, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, and biotechnology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:408c5090de12ffa5db09b1c1143779e76bc85b28","amp;dn":"Asymmetric+Synthesis+of+Non-Proteinogenic+Amino+Acids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"408c5090de12ffa5db09b1c1143779e76bc85b28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,140,80,144,222,18,255,165,219,9,177,193,20,55,121,231,107,200,91,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
