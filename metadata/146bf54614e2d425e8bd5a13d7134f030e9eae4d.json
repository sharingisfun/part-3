This hands-on guide introduces you to AngularJS, the open source JavaScript framework that uses Model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, data binding, client-side templates, and dependency injection to create a much-needed structure for building web apps.\n\nGuided by two engineers who worked on AngularJS at Google, you'll walk through the framework's key features, and then build a working AngularJS app-from layout to testing, compiling, and debugging. You'll learn how AngularJS helps reduce the complexity of your web app.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146bf54614e2d425e8bd5a13d7134f030e9eae4d","amp;dn":"AngularJS+-+O%27Reilly+Media","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146bf54614e2d425e8bd5a13d7134f030e9eae4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,107,245,70,20,226,212,37,232,189,90,19,215,19,79,3,14,158,174,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
