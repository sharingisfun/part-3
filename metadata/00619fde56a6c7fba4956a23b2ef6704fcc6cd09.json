By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. Born Standing Up is, in his own words, the story of &quot;why I did stand-up and why I walked away.&quot; At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times: the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies. \n\nDetails\nAudio CD \nAuthor: Steve Martin\nRead By: Steve Martin\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Audio; Unabridged edition \nReleased: 2007\nLanguage: English \nASIN: B001LYWSV8\nFile Type: rar\nFile Size: \nFormat: mp3\nBit Rate: 96 kbps\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHuge selection of audiobooks available at the blog.\n\nIf you visit please take the time to click on a few ads.
