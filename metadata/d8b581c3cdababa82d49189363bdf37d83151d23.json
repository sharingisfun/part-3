Martinez, guitarist Tim Mahoney, drummer Chad Sexton, and the bassist known only as P-Nut launched the group in 1990. Taking their name from the Omaha Police Department's code for indecent exposure, the quintet began gigging locally and soon moved to Los Angeles, signing with Capricorn Records in 1991. 311 then translated their regional success into national recognition with several key albums, including 1992's Music, 1993's Grassroots, and 1995's eponymous 311 (aka The Blue Album), the latter of which reached number 12 on the album chart, sold three million copies in the U.S., and sported the hit tracks &quot;All Mixed Up&quot; and &quot;Down.&quot;\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Down\n02.Come Original\n03.Beautiful Disaster\n04.All Mixed Up\n05.Amber\n06.Creatures (For A While)\n07.Prisoner\n08.Hey You\n09.Feels So Good\n10.Omaha Stylee\n11.Speak Easy\n12.From Chaos\n13.Jackpot\n14.Stealing Happy Hours\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8b581c3cdababa82d49189363bdf37d83151d23","amp;dn":"311+-+Playlist+The+Very+Best+Of+311+%282010%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8b581c3cdababa82d49189363bdf37d83151d23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,181,129,195,205,171,171,168,45,73,24,147,99,189,243,125,131,21,29,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
