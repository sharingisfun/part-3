This book will teach you how to become an expert in the pre-engagement, management, and documentation of penetration testing by building on your understanding of Kali Linux and wireless concepts.\nAbout This Book\n\n- Conduct realistic and effective security tests on your network\n- Demonstrate how key data systems are stealthily exploited, and learn how to identify attacks against your own systems\n- Use hands-on techniques to take advantage of Kali Linux, the open source framework of security tools\n\n\n\n+In Detail\n\n\nMastering Kali Linux for Advanced Penetration Testing will teach you the kill chain perspective in assessing network securityÃ¢â‚¬â€from selecting the most effective tools, to rapidly compromising network security, to highlighting the techniques used to avoid detection.\nThis book will take you, as a tester, through the reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities used by penetration testers and hackers. After learning the hands-on techniques to perform an effective and covert attack, specific routes to the target will be examined, including bypassing physical security. You will also get to grips with concepts such as social engineering, attacking wireless networks, web services, and remote access connections. Finally, you will focus on the most vulnerable part of the networkÃ¢â‚¬â€directly attacking the end user.\nThis book will provide all the practical knowledge needed to test your network's security using a proven hacker's methodology.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89a354c78b71119561dde02752c182f41eed6f4","amp;dn":"Mastering+Kali+Linux+for+Advanced+Penetration+Testing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89a354c78b71119561dde02752c182f41eed6f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,154,53,76,120,183,17,25,86,29,222,2,117,44,24,47,65,238,214,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
