I think it's complete (I haven't tested it yet, but it installed fine).\n\n\nTorrent Contents:\n==================\n\nAiR NFO file explaining what to do\nSetup executable\n\n\nInstallation:\n==============\n\nRun the setup, and follow the on-screen instructions (and enjoy the music :P).\n\n\nProduct Info:\n==============\n\nThe FET Compressor is an impressively faithful modeling of one of the most iconic compressors of all time. FET Compressor is loved for its aggressiveness and its tendency to add some tasty distortion to the sound source when driven hard. This compressor loves to be slammed and abused. But few things are so good they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be improved, so we added a couple of nice features that makes it even more flexible than the hardware original.\n\n\nIn short\n- Sweet input and output stage distortion.\n- Super fast attack time (just like the original)\n- Lookahead (in case you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find the originalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attack time fast enough)\n- Modeled Ã¢â‚¬Å“All buttons inÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mode\n- Continuous ratio (even between 20:1 and ALL) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but if you want the fixed ratios of the original, just click the ratio labels around the knob.\n- Parallel compression.\n- Detector low and high cut filters\n- External side chain\n- Stereo with synchronized gain reduction\n- Very CPU friendly\n- Meticiously modeled analog compressor. Each single stage of the analog unit has been modeled separately to achieve the exact sound and behavior of the original analog unit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12b3e9295275325442d6ccff33d6022ceb9cb45c","amp;dn":"Softube+FET+Compressor+v1.0.3+%5BAiR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12b3e9295275325442d6ccff33d6022ceb9cb45c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,179,233,41,82,117,50,84,66,214,204,255,51,214,2,44,235,156,180,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
