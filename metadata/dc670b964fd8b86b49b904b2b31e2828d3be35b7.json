This repacked version also includes the levels from Super Postal (2000), an unofficial expansion which was put on the japanese market without the awareness of Running With Scissors.\r\n\r\nA Week in Paradise addon allows you to play PostalÂ² with the new Apocalypse Weekend\r\nfeatures, such as new levels, dismemberment, and appropiate weapons for exploiting that possiblity.\r\n\r\nA Very Postal Christmas expansion pack is a christmas-themed game, featuring a large new snowy town to explore.\r\n\r\nThe Eternal Damnation expansion pack provides an entirely different, much darker storyline, also ambiented in a different town, starring a tormented psychiatric hospital patient as the protagonist.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements:\r\n\r\n  Windows: 95 with DirectX 7 for Postal, 98 with DirectX 8 for PostalÂ²\r\n\r\n  Linux: Kernel 2.2 or later, Glibc 2.1.x or later\r\n\r\n  Macintosh: 8.1 for Postal, Jaguar 10.2.8 for PostalÂ²\r\n\r\n\r\nMinimum hardware requirements:\r\n\r\n  For Postal: 16 MB RAM, Graphics Card, 90 MHz Processor\r\n\r\n  For PostalÂ²: 128 MB RAM, 32 MB Video, 733 MHz Pentium 3 or equivalent\r\n\r\n  For PÂ² addons/expansions: 384 MB RAM, 64 MB Video, 1.3 GHz Pentium 3\r\n  or equivalent\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that technically speaking this is not a repack of the 10th Anniversary Edition, because Postal files were taken from the Desura release, and PostalÂ² along with StP and AW are from the Steam's 'classic' release branch (because those digital versions are the latest ones from the pre-steam overhaul era), so repacked games might not work on extremely old systems... If that is the case, you can install the outdated ones from the Collector's Ed. MDF image (which has been included for preservation purposes).\r\n\r\nThe 'Extras' folder only contains GoG stuff, 'Music to Go Postal by' FLACs, PÂ² mods and cover images. \r\nIf you want the 10th Anniversary extras (except for new multiplayer maps, which are already bundled with repacked StP), you'll have to check the Collector's Ed. MDF image\r\n\r\nIf you like these games, please support RWS and buy the updated and overhauled Steam release! It has more entertaining stuff, plus an improved and more stable AWP.\r\n\r\nP.S.: repacked games, unlike original Collector's Ed. MDF image installers, should work out of the box on modern Mac and Linux systems!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc670b964fd8b86b49b904b2b31e2828d3be35b7","amp;dn":"POSTAL%3A+10th+Anniversary+Collector%27s+Edition+%5BWindows%2FMac%2FLinux%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc670b964fd8b86b49b904b2b31e2828d3be35b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,103,11,150,79,216,184,107,73,185,4,178,179,30,40,40,211,190,53,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
