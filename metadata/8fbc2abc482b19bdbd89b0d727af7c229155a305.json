BitTorrent is used for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) communications protocol. BitTorrent is a method of sharing large sized data widely without the original distributor incurring the entire costs of hardware, hosting and bandwidth resources. Instead, when data is distributed using the BitTorrent protocol, recipients each supply data to newer recipients, reducing the cost and burden on any given individual source, providing redundancy against system problems, and reducing dependence upon the original distributor. Usage of the protocol accounts for significant traffic on the Internet, but the precise amount has proven difficult to measure. There are numerous compatible BitTorrent clients, written in a variety of programming languages, and running on a variety of computing platforms.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nâ€“ Dynamic bandwidth management network channels.\r\nâ€“ BitTorrent does not interfere with other Internet-connected programs.\r\nâ€“ Parallel loading of multiple files.\r\nâ€“ Search for identical files for faster downloads.\r\nâ€“ Ability to create and distribute their torrent files.\r\nâ€“ Detailed information about media files ensures the security of downloads in BitTorrent.\r\nâ€“ Minimum settings.\r\nâ€“ Multilingual interface.\r\n\r\nFeatures Unlocked in this Pro version:\r\nâ€“ STREAM INSTANTLY\r\nâ€“ AUTOMATIC ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION\r\nâ€“ CONVERT FILES FOR TABLETS, PHONES &amp; TVS\r\nâ€“ REMOTE, SECURE ACCESS TO FILES\r\nâ€“ ULTRA-FAST FILE DELIVERY\r\nâ€“ FREE, UNLIMITED DOWNLOADING\r\nâ€“ BUILT-IN BANDWIDTH BOOSTER\r\n\r\nWhat's New ?\r\nâ€“ Official site does not provide any info about changes in this version","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fbc2abc482b19bdbd89b0d727af7c229155a305","amp;dn":"BitTorrent+Pro+7.9.5+Build+42450+Stable+Multilingual+%2B+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fbc2abc482b19bdbd89b0d727af7c229155a305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,188,42,188,72,43,25,189,189,137,176,215,39,175,124,34,145,85,163,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
