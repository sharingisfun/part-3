Whether we listen to National Public Radio in the morning, view the lead story on the &quot;Today &quot;show, read the morning newspaper headlines, stay up-to-the-minute with Internet news, browse grocery store tabloids, receive &quot;Time &quot;magazine in our mailbox, or watch the nightly news on television, journalism pervades our daily activities. The six-volume &quot;Encyclopedia of Journalism &quot;covers all significant dimensions of journalism, including print, broadcast, and Internet journalism; U.S. and international perspectives; history; technology; legal issues and court cases; ownership; and economics. The set contains more than 350 signed entries under the direction of leading journalism scholar Christopher H. Sterling of The George Washington University. In the A-to-Z volumes 1 through 4, both scholars and journalists contribute articles that span the field s wide spectrum of topics, from design, editing, advertising, and marketing to libel, censorship, First Amendment rights, and bias to digital manipulation, media hoaxes, political cartoonists, and secrecy and leaks. Also covered are recently emerging media such as podcasting, blogs, and chat rooms. The last two volumes contain a thorough listing of journalism awards and prizes, a lengthy section on journalism freedom around the world, an annotated bibliography, and key documents. The latter, edited by Glenn Lewis of CUNY Graduate School of Journalism and York College/CUNY, comprises dozens of primary documents involving codes of ethics, media and the law, and future changes in store for journalism education.Key ThemesConsumers and AudiencesCriticism and EducationEconomicsEthnic and Minority JournalismIssues and ControversiesJournalist OrganizationsJournalistsLaw and PolicyMagazine TypesMotion PicturesNetworksNews Agencies and ServicesNews CategoriesNews Media: U.S.News Media: WorldNewspaper TypesNews Program TypesOnline JournalismPolitical CommunicationsProcesses and Routines of JournalismRadio and TelevisionTechnology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24535b95deb51aff161074b359cc874c0c39254d","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Journalism+%286+Volume+Set%29+%282009%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24535b95deb51aff161074b359cc874c0c39254d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,83,91,149,222,181,26,255,22,16,116,179,89,204,135,76,12,57,37,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
