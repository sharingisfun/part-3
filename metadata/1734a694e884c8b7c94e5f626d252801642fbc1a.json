I recommend WinLoader\nand Windows 7 Pro/Ult to upgrade to 10 Pro.\n-Make sure your network connection is online during upgrade\nor the activation will not happen.\n-While KMS activators do work, we don't recommend them as they\nset your Activation channel to a default MAK and MS likely\nknows the difference. They could kill that activation later\nwith a WAT update.\n-After successful upgrade and system showing activated, then\nyou can re-install from boot and it should re-activate from\nMS servers. It reads your hardware info, not key.\n-Key will be generic for this upgrade offer. Do not try to\nenter one during boot setup unless you bought Win10.\n\nInstructions:\n-Use a USB program such as RUFUS to put this on a 16GB+ USB\nFlash drive for boot installs.\n-For upgrade, you can simply mount the iso. I would recommend\nusing the USB tho, in case your system gets borked during\nupgrade process.\n-Also, Uninstall any AV programs or specialized driver programs\nlike VM or VPN software before upgrading. They will likely\ninterfere with the process.\n\n-I am pretty sure it will fit on a Dual-Layer DVDR. Don't\nget mad at me if it doesn't. DVDs are antiques.\n-If you are installing Education, and don't have a legit key\nyou will need to enter the gVLK (KMS key) and use a KMS\nactivator such as MTK or KMSPico.\n-All of the enterprise versions have a spp package to set\nthe gVLK automatically.\n-I recommend inserting the gVLK during boot setup if you\nplan to install an Education or Enterprise SKU. It will\nchange the channel to Volume. It's not required, but it\nwill give you a bogus Retail channel if you don't.\n-THERE IS A SKIP BUTTON ON THE BOOT SETUP FOR KEY ENTRY. DO\nNOT COMPLAIN ABOUT ENTERING A KEY. PRESS SKIP!\n\nFinal note:\n-Yes I'm aware there are Pro VL versions. They're the same\nas Pro versions except they have a SPP package. There's not\nmuch point adding them to this and breaking the ability to\nfit on a fat32 UFD.\n\nCredits:\nCODYQX4 - Microsoft Toolkit KMS Activator for Enterprise/Pro\nmurphy78 - Integration, ISO design and testing\n\nEnjoy,\nmurphy78 :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1734a694e884c8b7c94e5f626d252801642fbc1a","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Windows+10+GA+AIO+DualBoot+en-US+murphy78","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1734a694e884c8b7c94e5f626d252801642fbc1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,52,166,148,232,132,200,183,201,78,95,98,109,37,40,1,100,47,188,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
