It also included the song &quot;Lend Me Your Comb&quot;, omitted from the collection Live at the BBC, released the previous year (1994). The song &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; was included at the very start. 450,000 copies of Anthology 1 were sold in its first day of release, the most sales for an album in a single day ever. The Beatles' first drummer Pete Best, replaced by the band's three founding members in 1962 before they recorded professionally for EMI, received his first substantial Beatles royalties from this album, for the inclusion of early demo tracks on which he played.\n\nOn 17 March 1996, Anthology 2 was released. The second collection presented out-takes and demos from the Beatles' sessions for Help!, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Magical Mystery Tour. These included selected early demos and takes for Lennon's &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, previously available only to bootleg collectors. The new song &quot;Real Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which, like &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;, was based on an unfinished Lennon recording ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was also included in the two-CD collection.\n\nOn 28 October 1996, Anthology 3 was released. The third collection featured out-takes and demos from The White Album, Abbey Road, and Let It Be as well as several Post-Beatle tracks from Harrison and McCartney.\n\n\nAnthology 1\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
