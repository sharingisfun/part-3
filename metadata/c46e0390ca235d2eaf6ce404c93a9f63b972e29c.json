Its controversial lyrics were the subject of shareholder protest (the album was supposed to be released in July 1995, as a result of the controversy from Time Warner, the release was delayed for three months). The album spawned two singles -- &quot;Let's Play House&quot; and &quot;New York, New York,&quot; featuring Nate Dogg and Snoop Dogg, respectively. It landed on the top of the Billboard 200 chart producing a first-week sales of 277,500 albums. Though it eventually sold over 2 million records (2x platinum), Dogg Food did not equal the success of preceding Death Row Records releases (The Chronic and Doggystyle). It is one of the last high-selling and critically acclaimed releases from the label, preceding only Tha Doggfather and 2Pac's albums as an anticipated album, and is the last album to be &quot;officially&quot; produced under the G-Funk (sub-genre) era of hip-hop which was pioneered by Above the Law. Though Dr. Dre was Death Row's premier producer, the album was mostly produced by Dat Nigga Daz, Dr. Dre mixed the album; Dogg Food led the way for Daz to become the top in-house producer for Death Row until his departure in the late '90s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c46e0390ca235d2eaf6ce404c93a9f63b972e29c","amp;dn":"Tha+Dogg+Pound+-+Dogg+Food+%281995%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c46e0390ca235d2eaf6ce404c93a9f63b972e29c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,110,3,144,202,35,93,46,175,108,228,4,201,58,159,99,185,114,226,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
