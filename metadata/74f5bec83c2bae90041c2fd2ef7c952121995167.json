With her sharp tongued and witty radio show Dear White People and her self-published book, Ebony and Ivy, Sam causes a stir among the administration and student body alike, criticizing white people and the racist transgressions at Winchester.\nWhen Sam wins the election for head of house of Armstrong/Parker, the all black house on campus, tensions rise. In winning the election, she beats her ex-boyfriend Troy Fairbanks, the son of the school's dean. Troy harbors dreams of being a comedic writer rather than a lawyer, but his father prefers that he not give white people a chance to profile him, and will accept nothing less than his best. Coco has an issue with Sam because the reality TV producer she is trying to win over would rather do a show on the witty light-skinned black girl than her. Lionel Higgins, a black gay student, gets a chance at finally finding his place at Winchester by being recruited by the school's most prestigious student paper to write a piece on Sam and the black experience at Winchester. When Kurt, a white student and son of the school's president, and his club come up with a blackface theme for their annual party in response to Sam's outspoken show, black students appear at the party, and a confrontation ensues, leading to a brawl.\n\n=================================================================================\nFILM:\n=================================================================================\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Dear White People 2014 720p WebRip [ChattChitto RG].mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFile size                                : 810 MB\nDuration                                 : 1h 48mn\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 043 Kbps\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2015-01-23 02:31:28\nTagged date                              : UTC 2015-01-23 05:45:59\nWriting application                      : HandBrake 0.9.8 2012071700\n\nVideo\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 1h 48mn\nBit rate                                 : 880 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 718 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nStream size                              : 682 MB (84%)\n\nAudio\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nDuration                                 : 1h 48mn\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 287 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nStream size                              : 124 MB (15%)\nTitle                                    : Stereo\nTitle                                    : Stereo\n\n=================================================================================\nCast:\n=================================================================================\n\nTyler James Williams as Lionel Higgins\nDennis Haysbert as the Dean\nTessa Thompson as Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; White\nKyle Gallner as Kurt\nBrittany Curran as Sophie Fletcher\nMarque Richardson as Reggie\nMalcolm Barrett as Helmut West\nTeyonah Parris as Colandrea &quot;Coco&quot; Conners\nBrandon P Bell as Troy\nPeter Syvertsen as President Hutchinson\nJustin Dobies as Gabe\nBrandon Alter as George\nKeith Myers as Black Mitch\nNaomi Ko as Sungmi\nKate Gaulke as Annie\nBrian Curtis James as Martin\nAshley Blaine Featherson as Curls\nJemar Michael as Dreads\nCourtney Sauls as Wild\nNia Jervier as Coco's Friend\n\n=================================================================================\nScreenshot:\n=================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f5bec83c2bae90041c2fd2ef7c952121995167","amp;dn":"Dear+White+People+2014+720p+WebRip+%5BChattChitto+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f5bec83c2bae90041c2fd2ef7c952121995167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,245,190,200,60,43,174,144,4,28,47,210,239,124,149,33,33,153,81,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
