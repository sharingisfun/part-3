In ePUB and PDF formats. First published in the 1960's, these remain the definitive English translations of Sade's work. Cover artwork is the original, first-edition covers.\n\n\nThe 120 Days of Sodom and Other Writings: An exhaustive catalogue of sexual aberrations and the first systematic explorationÃ¢â‚¬â€a hundred years before Krafft-Ebing and FreudÃ¢â‚¬â€of the psychology of sex, it is considered SadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crowning achievement and the cornerstone of his thought. Lost after the storming of the Bastille in 1789, it was later retrieved but remained unpublished until 1935.\n\nIn addition to The 120 Days, this volume includes SadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reflections on the Novel,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his play Oxtiern, and his novella Ernestine. The selections are introduced by Simone de BeauvoirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s landmark essay Ã¢â‚¬Å“Must We Burn Sade?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Pierre KlossowskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s provocative Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nature as Destructive Principle.&quot;\n\nJustine, Philosophy in the Bedroom, and Other Writings: This volume contains Philosophy in the Bedroom, a major novel that presents the clearest summation of his political philosophy; EugÃƒÂ©nie de Franval, a novella widely considered to be a masterpiece of eighteenth-century French literature; and the only authentic and complete American edition of his most famous work, Justine.\n\nThis literary portrait of Sade is completed by one of his earliest philosophical efforts, Dialogue between a Priest and a Dying Man, a selection of his letters, a fifty-page chronology of his life, two important essays on Sade, and a bibliography of his work.\n\nJuliette: While Justine, Juliette's sister, was a virtuous woman who consequently encountered nothing but despair and abuse, Juliette is an amoral nymphomaniac who is successful and happy. The full title of the novel in the original French is Histoire de Juliette ou les ProspÃƒÂ©ritÃƒÂ©s du vice, and the English title is &quot;Juliette, or Vice Amply Rewarded&quot; (versus &quot;Justine, or Good Conduct Well Chastised&quot;, considered to be the prequel of Juliette).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:322103f8215042510c0a719e978399b640bc84d0","amp;dn":"WorksOfTheMarquisDeSadeEPUB-PDF.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"322103f8215042510c0a719e978399b640bc84d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,33,3,248,33,80,66,81,12,10,113,158,151,131,153,182,64,188,132,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
