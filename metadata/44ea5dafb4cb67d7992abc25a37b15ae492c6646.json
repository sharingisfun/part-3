G. Wodehouse will love visiting Jasper Fforde's Great Britain, circa 1985, when time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is taken very, very seriously: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bibliophileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream. England is a virtual police state where an aunt can get lost (literally) in a Wordsworth poem and forging Byronic verse is a punishable offense. \n\nAll this is business as usual for Thursday Next, renowned Special Operative in literary detection. But when someone begins kidnapping characters from works of literature and plucks Jane Eyre from the pages of BrontÃƒÂ«'s novel, Thursday is faced with the challenge of her career. \n\nFforde's ingenious fantasyÃ¢â‚¬â€enhanced by a Web site that re-creates the world of the novelÃ¢â‚¬â€unites intrigue with English literature in a delightfully witty mix. \n\nThursdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s zany investigations continue with six more bestselling Thursday Next novels, including One of Our Thursdays is Missing and the upcoming The Woman Who Died A Lot.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44ea5dafb4cb67d7992abc25a37b15ae492c6646","amp;dn":"The+Eyre+Affair%3A+A+Thursday+Next+Novel+by+Jasper+Fforde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44ea5dafb4cb67d7992abc25a37b15ae492c6646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,234,93,175,180,203,103,215,153,42,188,37,163,123,21,174,73,44,102,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
