Came out in 1998 and you will still find people playing online on it\\&amp;#039;s Novalogic servers. Yes Online gameplay is available The game has great air to air and air to ground combat missions. With each successful mission you get promoted to a higher rank. Now you also have the ability to drop NUKES. Yes!!!. Don\\&amp;#039;t forget to play online with one of the most challenging players.\n\nCompared to my two other uploads, the 2GB one and the compressed one around 300MB. This is the original upload. It is one the first version that came out without a CD key. Also it is the complete game with music and videos. All packed into a 673MB iso file. Either burn the iso file on a CD or mount it using daemon tools.\n\nThe game also includes a demo copy of mig 29 and delta force one.\n\nIn order to play online you will have to update your game version. You can do this from within the game. Also I have included the update in this torrent. People who just want the update can go to the following site:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rapidshare.de/files/36657969/f22l3_update_061699_xx.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rapidshare.de/files/36657969/f22l3_update_061699_xx.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWHEN PLAYING ONLINE ON NOVAWORLD OR ANY MULTIPLAYER MODE. IF YOU ARE BEHIND A ROUTER/FIREWALL. MAKE SURE YOU FORWARD THE FOLLOWING PORTS:\n\nFROM 4533 TO 4660. DON\\&amp;#039;T KNOW IF IT\\&amp;#039;S TCP OR UDP. I HAVE SET IT TO BOTH.\n\nFor more info screenshots go click visit the following sites:\n\nGamespot:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/f22lightning3/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/sim/f22lightning3/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGameZ: http://games.gamez.com/sage/games.x?gid=7878&amp;page=details","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5739c0992c8da40aa5bbf40be780416af0820e6","amp;dn":"F-22+Lightning+3+original+complete+game+plus+Online+multiplayer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5739c0992c8da40aa5bbf40be780416af0820e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,115,156,9,146,200,218,64,170,91,191,64,190,120,4,22,175,8,32,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
