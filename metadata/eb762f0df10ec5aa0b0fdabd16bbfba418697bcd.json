The band seamlessly blends the hooks and technicality of early 90's American death metal, with atmosphere, melody and the brutality of their contemporaries.\n\nABYSMAL DAWN was formed by Charles Elliott (guitars/vocals), Jamie Boulanger (guitars), and Terry Barajas (drums) who circulated a three song demo in winter 2004. The demo garnered some attention for the band within the underground metal press circuit as well as helped them score gigs alongside Exodus, 3 Inches of Blood, Hate Eternal, Into Eternity, Aborted, and more.\n\nIn November Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ05, the band began work on what would become their first proper full-length From Ashes with engineer John Haddad (Intronaut, Eyes of Fire, Phobia). The resulting nine songs paid special attention to not only brutality, but song craft as well and earned the band a remarkable international press response for a debut album. On the strength of From Ashes, they earned their first U.S. tour, a five-week juggernaut alongside Six Feet Under and Decapitated and played as support throughout their home state with the likes of Suffocation, Emperor, Immortal, Goatwhore, Decrepit Birth, and more.\n\nIn 2007, ABYSMAL DAWN played a handful of festivals (LA Murderfest, Gathering of the Sick, Burning Star Metal Fest, and more) but most of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time we devoted to writing and rehearsing new material for their follow-up to From Ashes. By November, ABYSMAL DAWN had entered HaddadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new studio to begin the next full-length.\n\nABYSMAL DAWN spent the next three-months in and out of the studio crafting Programmed To Consume. One by one, track by track, the pieces of this record came together, including brand new artwork once again from Par Olofsson.\n\nIn February 2008, ABYSMAL DAWN signed a deal with Relapse Records, making Programmed To Consume the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s label debut. ABYSMAL DAWN will unleash this virulent strain of modern death metal on May 13th (May 19th internationally). The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s metallic assault thunders with all the hallmarks of death metalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest traits, and prove that ABYSMAL DAWN is an explosive new force in American death metal.\n\n\nGenre:\tDeath\nBitrate:\tWebrip\nSize:\t95.30 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n12 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb762f0df10ec5aa0b0fdabd16bbfba418697bcd","amp;dn":"Abysmal+Dawn+-+Obsolescence+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb762f0df10ec5aa0b0fdabd16bbfba418697bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,118,47,13,241,14,197,170,11,15,218,189,22,187,251,164,24,105,123,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
