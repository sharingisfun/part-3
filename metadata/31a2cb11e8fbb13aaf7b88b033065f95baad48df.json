This lavishly illustrated volume has been put together by some of the nation's leading architects. Each architect writes about the region in which he works. He discusses the architectural traditions of his area of the country, as well as its most modern home styles, and he presents a wide range of photographs and plans depicting regional home styling. Because each writer is a working architect, he can present the best of what is actually being built in America today, and he is thoroughly familiar with the requirements of real people for real homes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a2cb11e8fbb13aaf7b88b033065f95baad48df","amp;dn":"The+Illustrated+Guide+to+the+Houses+of+America+%28Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a2cb11e8fbb13aaf7b88b033065f95baad48df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,162,203,17,232,251,177,58,175,123,136,176,51,6,95,149,186,173,72,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
