His  breaking  of  the  German  U-boat  Enigma  cipher  in  World  War  II  ensured  Allied-American  control  of  the  Atlantic.  But  Turing's  vision  went  far  beyond  the  desperate  wartime  struggle.  Already  in  the  1930s  he  had  defined  the  concept  of  the  universal  machine,  which  underpins  the  computer  revolution.  In  1945  he  was  a  pioneer  of  electronic  computer  design.  But  Turing's  true  goal  was  the  scientific  understanding  of  the  mind,  brought  out  in  the  drama  and  wit  of  the  famous  &quot;Turing  test&quot;  for  machine  intelligence  and  in  his  prophecy  for  the  twenty-first  century.\n\n\nDrawn  in  to  the  cockpit  of  world  events  and  the  forefront  of  technological  innovation,  Alan  Turing  was  also  an  innocent  and  unpretentious  gay  man  trying  to  live  in  a  society  that  criminalized  him.  In  1952  he  revealed  his  homosexuality  and  was  forced  to  participate  in  a  humiliating  treatment  program,  and  was  ever  after  regarded  as  a  security  risk.  His  suicide  in  1954  remains  one  of  the  many  enigmas  in  an  astonishing  life  story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bf17d963573532dabd905c5f3c0e102fca23ed5","amp;dn":"Alan+Turing+%3A+The+Enigma+-+Andew+Hodges+%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bf17d963573532dabd905c5f3c0e102fca23ed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,241,125,150,53,115,83,45,171,217,5,197,243,192,225,2,252,162,62,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
