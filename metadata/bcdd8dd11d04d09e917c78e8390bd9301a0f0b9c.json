After moving several miles south to Manchester proper, the band went through a couple of developmental stages before attracting the interest of Island Records, which signed the group in 1998.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcdd8dd11d04d09e917c78e8390bd9301a0f0b9c","amp;dn":"Elbow+-+The+Take+Off+and+Landing+of+Everything+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcdd8dd11d04d09e917c78e8390bd9301a0f0b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,221,141,209,29,4,208,158,145,124,120,232,57,11,217,48,26,15,11,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
