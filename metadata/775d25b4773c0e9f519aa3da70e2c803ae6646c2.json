Surman performs eight of his moody and often-introspective originals, playing soprano, baritone, bass clarinet and synthesizers . . .\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Upon ReflectionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has two of the greatest, most atmospheric, synthesizer-backed, trippy saxophone solo tunes ever recorded by man, woman or mutant: &quot;Constellation&quot; &amp; &quot;Edges of Illusion.&quot; The rest of the album is also excellent but those two songs are must-haves for any jazz-saxophone or for that matter for any ambient-music fan, too.\n\nA mind trip for sure . . .     :)\n\n\n\nJOHN SURMAN\n\nUpon Reflection     1979\n\n\n- CD\n- ECM\n- 1979\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nJohn Surman plays Soprano and Baritone Saxophones, Bass Clarinet and Sythesizers\n\nRecorded in May 1979 at Talent Studios, Oslo\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775d25b4773c0e9f519aa3da70e2c803ae6646c2","amp;dn":"John+Surman+-+Upon+Reflection+-+1979+-+ECM+-+Jazz+-+320Kbps+%23+Dr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775d25b4773c0e9f519aa3da70e2c803ae6646c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,93,37,180,119,60,14,159,81,154,163,218,112,226,200,3,174,102,70,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
