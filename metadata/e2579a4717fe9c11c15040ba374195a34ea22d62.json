The rescue mission is a success, but Jake, separated after a firefight with the enemy, stays behind to help an injured soldier. Sergeant Vic Mosby desperately tries to convince Lieutenant Colonel Jackson (Dale Dye) to let him go back and save the soldiers, but is ordered on a mission to retrieve a truckload of munitions which could be vital for the military base. In direct violation of orders, Vic and his Special Ops Team decide to head back to the village to rescue the stranded soldiers. Outnumbered and out gunned, Vic and his men engage in a massive shootout against the enemy, while Jake uses his expert skills to help save them all from certain death.\r\n\r\n53b1a87122294.png\r\n\r\nSteven Seagal :...
