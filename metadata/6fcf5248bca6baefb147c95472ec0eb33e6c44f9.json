Some are ripped from DVD&amp;#039;s reissued by the BBC, and have additional audio commentary tracks (noted below).\n\nI think it goes without saying that you had better seed this like Johnny Appleseed.  I got sick and tired of waiting for some kind soul to do the dirty work, and decided to take it upon myself for the benefit of the community.  I was also partially inspired by a few massive Doctor Who collections that I&amp;#039;ve seen floating around the &amp;#039;net (6th &amp; 7th doctor completes).  To the individual(s) responsible for this generosity, THANK YOU.\n\nIf I may impose on any of you good Whovians, I am despirately trying to complete my Peter Davidson (5th doctor) collection, and would really, truly appreciate it if someone could upload Season 20 (Episodes 124:Arc of Infinity - 130:The Five Doctors).\n\nFinally, please do the following:\n1. BE PATIENT.  This is going to take half your lifetime to download.  I do not have the luxury of a T1, and live in a country that hasn&amp;#039;t rolled out fiber door-to-door.  If you just want a particular episode, most modern bittorrent programs will let you specify what you&amp;#039;d like to download (uTorrent, Azureus, etc.)\n\n2. SEED.  Seed, seed, seed.  This cannot be said enough.  Seed.  You think I like having my upstream completely flooded for the next month?  Hell no.  But I&amp;#039;m doing it, because it needs to be done.  With the resurgance in popularity of the Doctor Who series, it is simply CRIMINAL that the net isn&amp;#039;t flooded with 4th doctor episodes.\n\n3. ENJOY.
