But I don't think that does these albums justice. Sure, most of the lyrical concerns are still love-oriented, but many of the lyrics are becoming increasing complex. Even a song like Yesterday shows a real maturity in the lyrics.\nThe songs offered here are the Beatles at the top of their game, in my opinion. Gorgeous melodies, catchy hooks, great harmony singing and sharp musicianship abound. The Beatles were becoming increasing facile in the studio, and it shows. The strength of songs like Help, Ticket to Ride and Yesterday are legend, but there are many other real gems on this album. You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and Your Going to Lose That Girl are classic mid-period Lennon; McCartney answers with the rocking Another Girl and The Night Before, not to mention the beautiful, folky I've Just Seen a Face, all extremely underrated. \n\nHarrison gets two songs on this album, and asserts himself well with the lovely pop of I Need You and You Like Me Too Much. Maybe not up to the dizzying heights of Lennon &amp; McCartney songsmithing, but getter closer. \n\nThis leaves &quot;filler&quot; like Act Naturally, Tell Me What You See and Dizzy Miss Lizzy. Just listen to Lennon's vocal performance on Dizzy Miss Lizzy and try calling it filler...though admittedly, the guitar riff grates on one after a while. Ringo's &quot;aw, shucks&quot; reading of Act Naturally is PERFECT (and SO appropriate) and Lennon &amp; McCartney's magical harmonies lift Tell Me What You See well above the pedestrian.\n\nThat's it. Overwhelming evidence, well presented, that this is not just a mediocre holding pattern album, but classic mid-period Beatles. It's now up to you, members of the juke-box jury.\n\nI'll say no more. \n\nby &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9ef9f1ecfaf1f0deecebecfff2eafbf2b0f0fbea&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Help!.wma                                              \n02 - The Night Before.wma                                   \n03 - You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.wma                  \n04 - I Need You.wma                                         \n05 - Another Girl.wma                                       \n06 - You're Going To Lose That Girl.wma                     \n07 - Ticket To Ride.wma                                     \n08 - Act Naturally.wma                                      \n09 - It's Only Love.wma                                     \n10 - You Like Me Too Much.wma                               \n11 - Tell Me What You See.wma                               \n12 - I`ve Just Seen A Face.wma                              \n13 - Yesterday.wma                                          \n14 - Dizzy Miss Lizzy.wma  \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\t\n\nFOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK PAGES: MARCELODRGZTPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e35c9be836b2aeaf49b246b5be34695bce99e97","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Help%21+%281965%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e35c9be836b2aeaf49b246b5be34695bce99e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,53,201,190,131,107,42,234,244,155,36,107,91,227,70,149,188,233,158,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
