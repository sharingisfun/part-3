At the root of the confusion lies three key questions: What is biological, what is cultural, and what can we do when things go wrong?  After centuries of assuming that we humans, with our mysterious minds and messy emotions, were just not fit subjects for study, science has developed some startling insights into human nature. This three-part series, produced by WGBH and Vulcan Productions, takes viewers on an in-depth tour of the science of human emotions in an effort to truly understand what makes us tick.  Using the latest cutting edge research from neuroscience, startling observations from social science and experts in psychology, This Emotional Life will explore the biological need for social relationships, how to manage negative feelings, and the search for greater happiness, unveiling a new understanding of what it means to be human.\n\nFamily, Friends &amp; Lovers\nHow and why are relationships central to our emotional well-being? In this episode, the story of a young boy adopted from a Russian orphanage illustrates how child-caregiver attachments beginning in the very first days of life lay the groundwork for future relationships. Also, new parents struggle with a newborn baby, a couple grapples with a troubled marriage, a grown man learns to thrive with Asperger's syndrome, and more-all demonstrating the importance of social connections and relationships.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 931 MiB for 1h 56mn 2s 596ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Scince/Nature\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 987 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 121 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22160192f26bf504569f0dee8b6d73340e3a8666","amp;dn":"PBS.This+Emotional+Life+%282009%29.1of3.WS.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22160192f26bf504569f0dee8b6d73340e3a8666","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,22,1,146,242,107,245,4,86,159,13,238,139,109,115,52,14,58,134,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
