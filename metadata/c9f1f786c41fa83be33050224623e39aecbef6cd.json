Singles, despite its generic moniker, does an excellent job illuminating the fact that Bernard Butler and Brett Anderson were far more David Bowie and Mick Ronson than the oft-cited Morrissey/Johnny Marr press quips would have you believe. The group's penchant for neo-glam excess and apocalyptic grandstanding inundated their entire time line, from 1992's &quot;Animal Nitrate&quot; and &quot;Metal Mickey&quot; all the way through to 2002's New Morning, despite the switching out of Butler for the flashier Richard Oakes. While the group's 1993 debut and 1994 follow-up Dog Man Star remain required listening for anyone with even a passing interest in the scene, this collection, paired with 1997's Sci-Fi Lullabies, presents a near perfect picture of one of the late-'90s most underrated acts.\nAll Music Review by James Christopher Monger\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Beautiful Ones\n[02] Animal Nitrate\n[03] Trash\n[04] Metal Mickey\n[05] So Young\n[06] The Wild Ones\n[07] Obsessions\n[08] Filmstar\n[09] Can't Get Enough\n[10] Everything Will Flow\n[11] Stay Together\n[12] Love The Way You Love\n[13] The Drowners\n[14] New Generation\n[15] Lazy\n[16] She's In Fashion\n[17] Attitude\n[18] Electricity\n[19] We Are The Pigs\n[20] Positivity\n[21] Saturday Night\n\nPlay Time - 01h:18m:29s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 188mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
