Not only did he score a series of multi-million-selling albums containing chart-topping hit singles and perform sold-out tours of the U.S. and around the world, but he also took charge of his music creatively, writing or co-writing most of his songs and arranging and producing his records. He also performed these functions for other artists, providing them with hits as well. He was, however, equally well known for his distinctive interpretations of classic pop and R&amp;B songs, reflecting his knowledge and appreciation of the popular music of his youth. Possessed of a smooth, versatile tenor voice, he charmed millions with his romantic music.\n\n\nArtist...............: Luther Vandross\nAlbum................: The Essential Luther Vandross (2003)\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2003\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/22/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, Audiochecker\nCovers...............: Front, Back, CD\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Searching\n02.The Glow Of Love\n03.Never Too Much\n04.Sugar And Spice (I Found Me A Girl)\n05.She's A Super Lady\n06.Give Me The Reason\n07.Stop To Love\n08.See Me\n09.I Really Didn't Mean It\n10.Any Love\n11.Here And Now\n12.Love The One You're With\n13.Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now (Morales Remix)\n14.I Gave It Up (When I Fell In Love) (Marcus Miller Mix)\n15.Power Of LoveLove Power (Dance Radio Mix)\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now\n02.Always And Forever\n03.Endless Love (Duet With Mariah Carey)\n04.She's So Good To Me\n05.So Amazing\n06.I Gave It Up (When I Fell In Love)\n07.Your Secret Love\n08.Little Miracles (Happen Every Day)\n09.Heaven Knows\n10.A House Is Not A Home\n11.Power Of Love (Love Power Original)\n12.My Sensitivity (Gets In The Way)\n13.The Night I Fell In Love\n14.Never Too Much ('89 Remix)\n15.Stop To Love Remix (Marcus Miller Mix)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6a9d373fffb8c09e7cb842baa5360e04ef67aa6","amp;dn":"Luther+Vandross+-+The+Essential+%282003%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6a9d373fffb8c09e7cb842baa5360e04ef67aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,169,211,115,255,251,140,9,231,203,132,43,170,83,96,224,78,246,122,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
