Nora \n    \nOne of the first things that one realizes during anatomy lab is that the paintings in your textbook don\\\\\\&amp;#039;t really reflect the reality of an embalmed corpse. Arteries are not conveniently painted bright red, nor are nerves colored a nice polite yellow. \nThe Color Atlas of Anatomy does a fantastic job of helping one translate the color drawings from the big anatomy textbooks into the lab by providing high-quality labelled photos of model dissections by expert anatomists. Think you have the hypogastric nerve in your abdomenal wall but aren\\\\\\&amp;#039;t too sure what it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s supposed to look like? My partner and I were in just that position and the Color Atlas helped us go from the idealized material of our lecture notes and Netter\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Atlas to realities of our cadaver. \n\nIn addition to the photos, I found the schematic drawings to be a nice way to keep in mind the general organization of basic membranes and organs in the body, and the MR and X-Ray scans were useful as well in learning how to read radiograms and MRI images. This book does a great job of teaching you what anatomic specimens really look like, and help you appreciate the great beauty and elegance of the human body. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1065d40d97fa54915c9d84267b58c104e35486f","amp;dn":"Color+Atlas+of+Anatomy%28Photographic%29+Rohen%2C+Yokochi%2C+Elke+Lutjen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1065d40d97fa54915c9d84267b58c104e35486f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,6,93,64,217,127,165,73,21,201,216,66,103,181,140,16,78,53,72,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
