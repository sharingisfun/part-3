She, along with her friends, Darren Patterson, Dodie Bishop and Macie Lightfoot, all try to rise from the position of school geeks as they solve many conflicts that come their way. Luckily for Ginger, the most popular girl in school, Courtney Gripling, has taken a liking to her and often includes her in her social plans. She is intrigued by her 'gingerisms', as Courtney calls them. However, Miranda Killgallen, Courtney's right hand woman, makes sure that she is not bumped down from her position thanks to Ginger. At home, Ginger records her lively adventures in her diary. Her little brother Carl, is often scheming with Robert-Joseph (&quot;Hoodsey&quot;) Bishop in his own side plots, and her mother, Lois, is always there for advice Ginger is always open to listen to. The series takes place in the fictional town of Sheltered Shrubs, located in Connecticut.\n\nEnglish, no subtitles\nRipped from TV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456ea802481e7b1c40223f02a2bd12dd78938e59","amp;dn":"As+told+by+Ginger+%28all+episodes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456ea802481e7b1c40223f02a2bd12dd78938e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,110,168,2,72,30,123,28,64,34,63,2,162,189,18,221,120,147,142,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
