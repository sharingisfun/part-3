A complex series of drivable freeways connect the neighborhoods together.\n\n\nEmergent Gameplay\nWant to make a name for yourself in the underground? You'll need to find it first. Races can happen anywhere and at any time and as players encounter rivals on the street they'll be clued into where they can buy the hottest upgrades or enter the most elite events.\n\n\nNew Gameplay Modes\nThree new gameplay modes are added to last year's circuit, drift and drag competitions, challenging gamers to hone their skills in a number of driving disciplines.\n\n\nPerformance Tuning\nTune every aspect of your car's performance with hundreds of licensed aftermarket performance upgrades and then fine-tune everything from the gear ratio to the suspension for the ultimate ride.\n\n\nThe Hottest Cars\nMore than thirty of the most sought-after tuner cars are available from the hottest manufacturersÃ¢â‚¬â€from Nissan Motor Co., ToyotaTM, and Mitsubishi Motors and more - if they're hot on the street, they're in the game.\n\n\nVisual Customisation\nWith more than twice the visual customizations of last year's game, there are literally billions of car combinations available to gamers. Featuring audio upgrades, scissor doors, spoilers, headlights, side skirts, roof scoops, hoods, rims, wide body kits, neon and more, if you can trick it out in real life, you can trick it out in Need for Speed Underground 2.\n\n\nEnvironmental Variety\nEach of the five distinct neighborhoods in Need for Speed Underground 2 feature a unique look and feel, including varied driving conditions and track types. Road surfaces, real-time weather effects, and environmental hazards will keep gamers on their toes as they race from dusk till dawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------\n\nTested and working on OSX-Lion, 10.7.5\n\n----------------\n\nINSTALL:\n1.
