In his early stand-up days, if he walked on stage and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like the crowd, he would walk off. Together with Jerry Seinfeld, he pitched NBC on a sitcom where nothing happens. A whole show could be about waiting in line at a Chinese restaurant. And somehow Seinfeld became the most successful comedy show of all time. After nine years of writing and producing Seinfeld, and after making a huge amount of money, Larry David began to create a new show for HBO. Without much separation between himself and the character he plays, Curb follows the daily routines of Larry David. Being politically correct is far from LarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind, and the audience cringes as he berates, torments, and blusters his way into the hearts of TV watchers. Follow the early exploits of LarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stand-up career, his days writing for Seinfeld, and learn how Curb was conceived and developed. Pretty, Pretty, Pretty Good Ã¢â‚¬â€œ titled after LarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key catchphrase Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also explores LarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on- and off-screen relationships with famous pals like Richard Lewis, Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, and the cast of Seinfeld, and contains an in-depth episode guide to Curb Your Enthusiasm.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60255ba8a0f1256a662529ac68d8c80b31c8ea30","amp;dn":"Pretty%2C+Pretty%2C+Pretty+Good%3A+Larry+David+and+the+Making+of+Seinf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60255ba8a0f1256a662529ac68d8c80b31c8ea30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,37,91,168,160,241,37,106,102,37,41,172,104,216,200,11,49,200,234,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
