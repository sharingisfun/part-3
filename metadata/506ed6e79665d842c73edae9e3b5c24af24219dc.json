I almost rated this recording a 4 because of the 20+ year old recording technology. But then I listened more seriously and was truly taken back with the fun roller coaster ride that Jaco and his 20 piece band took me on. With players like Don Alias on Percussion, Randy Brecker on Trumpet, Peter Erskine playing smoking drums and too many other heavyweights to mention I was taken to a really good place. From Jaco's incredible playing to Erskine, Brecker, french horns, tuba etc. this album goes where very few go even today. All I can say is buy it and hold on to your seat.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Invitation\n02 - Soul Intro - The Chicken\n03 - Continuum\n04 - Liberty City\n05 - Three Views of a Secret\n06 - Sophisticated Lady\n\n*2013 Warner Japan / Rhino | WPCR-27456 | Jazz Best Collection 1000 Series\n {2013 Japan 24-bit Remaster}\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJaco Pastorius - bass\nDon Alias - percussion\nRandy Brecker - trumpet\nPeter Erskine - drums\nBobby Mintzer - tenor and soprano saxophone, bass clarinet\nOthello Molineaux - steel drums\nToots Thielemans - harmonica\n\n\nAMAZING LIVE ALBUM, Highly recommended.-\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
