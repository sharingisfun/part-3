And the next Saturday night they'd be back at The carnival or some other place of indulgence.\n\n&quot;I knew then that the Christian Church thrives on hypocrisy, and that man's carnal nature will out!&quot;\n\n \n\n\nFrom that time early in his life his path was clear. Finally, on the last night of April, 1966Ã¢â‚¬â€Walpurgisnacht, the most important festival of the believers in witchcraftÃ¢â‚¬â€LaVey shaved his head in the tradition of Ancient executioners and announced the formation of The Church Of Satan. He had seen the need for a church that would recapture man's body and his carnal desires as objects of celebration. &quot;Since worship of fleshly things produces pleasure,&quot; he said, &quot;there would then be a temple of glorious indulgence . . .&quot;\n \n\nThe Satanic Scriptures - Peter H Gilmore\n\nThe Satanic Scriptures hands down the wit, wisdom and diabolical perspective of the Church of Satan's High Priest, Magus Peter H. Gilmore. These essays, articles and diatribes have been collected from over twenty years of the High Priest's writings for his infernal cabal, some first issued in the pages of publications available only to insiders. From the magic of toys to techniques of time travel, Magus Gilmore leads the reader down a Left-Hand Path where few will find what they expect. The Devil always has all the best tunes and now you'll hear from a Satanic Maestro how the Dark Lord has influenced composers and musicians long before the advent of electric guitars and stadium concerts. Magus Gilmore reveals principles of Satanic Ritual in a frank discussion of forbidden rites. What is a Satanic Funeral? How do Satanists marry? Find out now, as these unholy ceremonies have never before been disclosed outside of the Church of Satan's Hellish Hierarchy. Here is the philosophy for those bold enough to be their own Gods-or Devils.(less)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2e9d7efb4e69d1a45c3b21638e0e0363394f882","amp;dn":"Satanic+Bible+%26amp%3B+Satanic+Scriptures+-+PDF+-+Mr+Festus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2e9d7efb4e69d1a45c3b21638e0e0363394f882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,233,215,239,180,230,157,26,69,195,178,22,56,224,224,54,51,148,248,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
