Covering all their 6 albums released during 1977 till 1985, along with a string of non-album tracks and rarities. \n\nTheir selftitled from 1977 is very well represented with no less than than 9 tracks; even more if you add those from the American version of the album. Most of these songs are simple straight-forward punk-rockers, not very different from the style of the first Sex Pistols album, though thinner in production. One track though, &quot;Police and Thieves&quot; differs quite markedly, and this song shows that the band were capeable of more than just playing simple rock - the reggae influence would be apparent on all their following albums. \n\nAmong the early non-album tracks &quot;Groovy Times&quot;, &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; and &quot;Bankrobber&quot; stand out. \n\nMy vinyl version of their second album &quot;Give' em Enough Rope&quot; has a pretty dull sound; fortunately this is not the case with the songs off the album included on this collection. My trhree favourites from the album &quot;Safe European Home&quot;, &quot;Stay Free&quot; and &quot;Julie's Been Working for the Drug Squad&quot; have all been included here, so that really great. \n\nTheir 1979 masterpiece double album &quot;London Calling&quot;, obviously has not been included in its whole, and several classics from the album has been left out. The songs included are all great, but I would have liked to have &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot; and &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;, too. \n\nEven harder to cover is the extended 3 records album Sandinista from 1980. The album is pretty uneven and some tracks actually do sound like rehearsals or demos. The songs included from the album are all okay; especially &quot;Somebody Got Murdered&quot;. I miss &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;Washington Bullets&quot;. \n\n&quot;Combat Rock&quot; from 1982 was the last to feature guitarist and songwriter Mick Jones. It has a simpler, more rocking approach than their previous two, and perhaps fewer memorable tracks. &quot;Rock the Cashbah&quot; and &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; are classics, of course. \n\nTheir final album, &quot;Cut the Crap&quot; from 1985 is their least successful, and it is only represented by one song &quot;This is England&quot;. A very logical choice, since it's really the outsstanding song on the album. \n\nA fine compilation; really made me consider purchasing &quot;Sandinista&quot; and &quot;London Calling&quot; on CD as well. \n\nby Morten Vindberg\n\nTRACKLIST: \nDisc 1:\n01 - White Riot.wma                                              \n02 - London's Burning.wma                                        \n03 - Complete Control.wma                                        \n04 - Clash City Rockers (Original Version).wma                   \n05 - I'm So Bored With The Usa.wma                               \n06 - Carreer Opportunities.wma                                   \n07 - Hate &amp; War.wma                                              \n08 - Cheat.wma                                                   \n09 - Police &amp; Thieves.wma                                        \n10 - Janie Jones.wma                                             \n11 - Garageland.wma                                              \n12 - Capital Radio One.wma                                       \n13 - (White Man) In Hammersmith Palais.wma                       \n14 - English Civil War.wma                                       \n15 - Tommy Gun.wma                                               \n16 - Safe European Home.wma                                      \n17 - Julie's Been Working For The Drug Squad.wma                 \n18 - Stay Free.wma                                               \n19 - Groovy Times.wma                                            \n20 - I Fought The Law.wma   \n\nDisc 2:\n01 - London Calling.wma                                          \n02 - The Guns Of Brixton.wma                                     \n03 - Clampdown.wma                                               \n04 - Rudie Can't Fail.wma                                        \n05 - Lost In The Supermarket.wma                                 \n06 - Jimmy Jazz.wma                                              \n07 - Train In Vain.wma                                           \n08 - Bankrobber.wma                                              \n09 - The Magnificent Seven.wma                                   \n10 - Ivan Meets G.i.
