The Lord Ruler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves. As KelsierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her. Stopping assassins may keep VinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mistborn skills sharp, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run itself, and Vin and the other members of KelsierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get easier with three armies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of them composed of ferocious giants Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord RulerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal. As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.\n\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 256 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f2ebaf5206d22af24c6fa6f1593d19c5ac4d9e6","amp;dn":"Brandon+Sanderson+-+The+Well+of+Ascension+%28Mistborn+%232%29+%5BGraphic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f2ebaf5206d22af24c6fa6f1593d19c5ac4d9e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,46,186,245,32,109,34,175,36,198,250,111,21,147,209,156,90,196,217,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
