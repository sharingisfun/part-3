Research on your own to find out what a great guy and mentor he really is - Big Papi\n\n\n\n\n\nBy A Customer\nPrince and Jazz are apart of the changing of the guard in mid 80's rap. They reflected an expanding genre where groups like Public Enemy and The Beastie Boys where apart of the mainstay. Jazzy Jeff is by far one of the worlds greatest DJ's and Fresh Prince is one of the most talented and intricate rappers to come along. Anyone who disagrees has never seen them live. I find it shameful that when Eminem had bad words for Will Smith, no one in the rap world stood up to defend Will. Eminem needs to show respect for a legend and understand that his unique &quot;character trait&quot; is what makes him rich and famous - not his skills. There have been thousands of emcees since 1975 and most of them have been much more skillful than Eminem but have not been as successful. Is it coincidence that Vanilla Ice was just as big as Eminem... I doubt it. I can't beleive the rap community was so spineless in defending this legend - Will Smith. We gotcha back Will.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf79c2704ba2249e96314479c1921720cd8f494e","amp;dn":"DJ+Jazzy+Jeff+%26amp%3B+the+Fresh+Prince+Greatest+Hits+320cbr+1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf79c2704ba2249e96314479c1921720cd8f494e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,121,194,112,75,162,36,158,150,49,68,121,193,146,23,32,205,143,73,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
