Quantitative researchers tend to use more mathematical techniques for pricing models and to quantify credit risk and relative value. The information found here bridges these two approaches. In an intuitive and readable style, this book illustrates how quantitative techniques can help address specific questions facing today's credit managers and risk analysts.\n\nA targeted volume in the area of credit, this reliable resource contains some of the most recent and original research in this field, which addresses among other things important questions raised by the credit crisis of 2008-2009. Divided into two comprehensive parts, Quantitative Credit Portfolio Management offers essential insights into understanding the risks of corporate bondsÃ¢â‚¬â€spread, liquidity, and Treasury yield curve riskÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as managing corporate bond portfolios.\n\nPresents comprehensive coverage of everything from duration time spread and liquidity cost scores to capturing the credit spread premium\nWritten by the number one ranked quantitative research group for four consecutive years by Institutional Investor\nProvides practical answers to difficult question, including: What diversification guidelines should you adopt to protect portfolios from issuer-specific risk? Are you well-advised to sell securities downgraded below investment grade?\nCredit portfolio management continues to evolve, but with this book as your guide, you can gain a solid understanding of how to manage complex portfolios under dynamic events.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nForeword xvii\nIntroduction xix\n\nNotes on Terminology xxvii\n\nPART ONE Measuring the Market Risks of Corporate Bonds\n\nCHAPTER 1 Measuring Spread Sensitivity of Corporate Bonds 3\n\nAnalysis of Corporate Bond Spread Behavior 5\n\nA New Measure of Excess Return Volatility 20\n\nRefinements and Further Tests 25\n\nSummary and Implications for Portfolio Managers 30\n\nAppendix: Data Description 34\n\nCHAPTER 2 DTS for Credit Default Swaps 39\n\nEstimation Methodology 40\n\nEmpirical Analysis of CDS Spreads 41\n\nAppendix: Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Approach 51\n\nCHAPTER 3 DTS for Sovereign Bonds 55\n\nSpread Dynamics of Emerging Markets Debt 55\n\nDTS for Developed Markets Sovereigns: The Case of Euro Treasuries 59\n\nManaging Sovereign Risk Using DTS 66\n\nCHAPTER 4 A Theoretical Basis for DTS 73\n\nThe Merton Model: A Zero-Coupon Bond 74\n\nDependence of Slope on Maturity 77\n\nCHAPTER 5 Quantifying the Liquidity of Corporate Bonds 81\n\nLiquidity Cost Scores (LCS) for U.S. Credit Bonds 82\n\nLiquidity Cost Scores: Methodology 88\n\nLCS for Trader-Quoted Bonds 92\n\nLCS for Non-Quoted Bonds: The LCS Model 96\n\nTesting the LCS Model: Out-of-Sample Tests 102\n\nLCS for Pan-European Credit Bonds 113\n\nUsing LCS in Portfolio Construction 123\n\nTrade Efficiency Scores (TES) 129\n\nCHAPTER 6 Joint Dynamics of Default and Liquidity Risk 133\n\nSpread Decomposition Methodology 138\n\nWhat Drives OAS Differences across Bonds? 139\n\nHow Has the Composition of OAS Changed? 141\n\nSpread Decomposition Using an Alternative Measure of Expected Default Losses 145\n\nHigh-Yield Spread Decomposition 147\n\nApplications of Spread Decomposition 147\n\nAlternative Spread Decomposition Models 150\n\nAppendix 152\n\nCHAPTER 7 Empirical versus Nominal Durations of Corporate Bonds 157\n\nEmpirical Duration: Theory and Evidence 159\n\nSegmentation in Credit Markets 173\n\nPotential Stale Pricing and Its Effect on Hedge Ratios 173\n\nHedge Ratios Following Rating Changes: An Event Study Approach 179\n\nUsing Empirical Duration in Portfolio Management Applications 186\n\nPART TWO Managing Corporate Bond Portfolios\n\nCHAPTER 8 Hedging the Market Risk in Pairs Trades 197\n\nData and Hedging Simulation Methodology 199\n\nAnalysis of Hedging Results 200\n\nAppendix: Hedging Pair-Wise Trades with Skill 208\n\nCHAPTER 9 Positioning along the Credit Curve 213\n\nData and Methodology 214\n\nEmpirical Analysis 217\n\nCHAPTER 10 The 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2009 Credit Crisis 229\n\nSpread Behavior during the Credit Crisis 229\n\nApplications of DTS 234\n\nAdvantages of DTS in Risk Model Construction 244\n\nCHAPTER 11 A Framework for Diversification of Issuer Risk 249\n\nDowngrade Risk before and after the Credit Crisis 250\n\nUsing DTS to Set Position-Size Ratios 257\n\nComparing and Combining the Two Approaches to Issuer Limits 260\n\nCHAPTER 12 How Best to Capture the Spread Premium of Corporate Bonds? 265\n\nThe Credit Spread Premium 266\n\nMeasuring the Credit Spread Premium for the IG Corporate Index 266\n\nAlternative Corporate Indexes 279\n\nCapturing Spread Premium: Adopting an Alternative Corporate Benchmark 288\n\nCHAPTER 13 Risk and Performance of Fallen Angels 295\n\nData and Methodology 298\n\nPerformance Dynamics around Rating Events 303\n\nFallen Angels as an Asset Class 319\n\nCHAPTER 14 Obtaining Credit Exposure Using Cash and Synthetic Replication 337\n\nCash Credit Replication (TCX) 338\n\nSynthetic Replication of Cash Indexes 351\n\nCredit RBIs 358\n\nReferences 367\n\nIndex 371\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\nARIK BEN-DOR, PhD, is a Director and Senior Analyst in the Quantitative Portfolio Strategy (QPS) Group at Barclays Capital Research.
