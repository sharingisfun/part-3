Or will you be the terrible sword that swats down what others have built, crushing all in your path?\r\nThe time has come to take the reins of history and become the Great Khan!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b9fe53a6e8bfc62874f4f54b9676d0a014568d2","amp;dn":"Crusader+Kings+II+v2.6.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b9fe53a6e8bfc62874f4f54b9676d0a014568d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,159,229,58,110,139,252,98,135,79,79,84,185,103,109,10,1,69,104,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
