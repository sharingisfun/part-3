The setting was their hometown o\nf Brisbane, where lead singer Sam Hales, guitarist Cesira Aitken and bassist Andrew Dooris were in opposing bands at high school. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t until Sam tried to start a band at university that he realized Cesira and Andrew, good friends and great musicians, were the missing ingredients.\n\nSam, Cesira and Andrew joined forces to create The Jungle Giants. What unified and cemented their relationship was their respect for each members musicianship. Andrew only picked up the bass to join the band and drummer Keelan Bijker passed the stringent test of dedication to the drums.\n\nIn the beginning, lead singer and songwriter, Sam worked two jobs for six months to pay for their self-titled debut EP to be recorded with Brisbane producer, Yanto Browning. The batch of humble songs produced during this session was quickly noticed.\n\nHales was awarded the 2011 Billy Thorpe scholarship for his song-writing prowess and Australia fell in love with their rhythmic indie pop tunes with Ã¢â‚¬ËœMr PoliteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo One Needs To KnowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ garnering the attention of radio stations around the country. Since releasing Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Jungle GiantsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and having only played eight shows before its release, The Jungle Giants have honed their live show to perfection and made many new friends on the road playing alongside Boy and Bear, Last Dinosaurs, Ball Park Music and San Cisco. \n\n\nThe Jungle Giants (2011)\t \nMr Polite \t\nNo One Needs To Know \t\nAll The Wrong Places \t\nLike A Weight \t\nOne of These Days\n\n\nShe's a Riot - EP (2012)\t \nShe's a Riot \t\nDon't Know What Else to Do \nYou've Got Something\nWay Back When \t\nBack to the Start\n\n\nVideos\nMr Polite\nNo One Needs To Know\nShe's a Riot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e301555628159ead132edfc336abf96c627702b5","amp;dn":"The+Jungle+Giants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e301555628159ead132edfc336abf96c627702b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,1,85,86,40,21,158,173,19,46,223,195,54,171,249,108,98,119,2,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
