Winter just wasn't my season&quot;\nYeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes\nLike they have any right at all to criticize,\nHypocrites. You're all here for the very same reason\n\n'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable\nAnd life's like an hourglass, glued to the table\nNo one can find the rewind button, girl.\nSo cradle your head in your hands\nAnd breathe... just breathe,\nOh breathe, just breathe\n\nMay he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss\n&quot;Just a day&quot; he said down to the flask in his fist,\n&quot;Ain't been sober, since maybe October of last year.&quot;\nHere in town you can tell he's been down for a while,\nBut, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles,\nWanna hold him. Maybe I'll just sing about it.\n\nCause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,\nAnd life's like an hourglass, glued to the table.\nNo one can find the rewind button, boys,\nSo cradle your head in your hands,\nAnd breathe... just breathe,\nOh breathe, just breathe\n\nThere's a light at each end of this tunnel,\nYou shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out\nAnd these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again\nIf you'd only try turning around.\n\n2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song\nIf I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me,\nThreatening the life it belongs to\nAnd I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd\nCause these words are my diary, screaming out loud\nAnd I know that you'll use them, however you want to\n\nBut you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,\nAnd life's like an hourglass, glued to the table\nNo one can find the rewind button now\nSing it if you understand.\nand breathe, just breathe\nwoah breathe, just breathe,\nOh breathe, just breathe,\nOh breathe, just breathe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbbe8a84ff945f21709d88b81cdf85be942556fc","amp;dn":"Anna+Nalick+-+Breathe+%282+AM%29+320cbr+Single","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbbe8a84ff945f21709d88b81cdf85be942556fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,190,138,132,255,148,95,33,112,157,136,184,28,223,133,190,148,37,86,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
