No other single volume will match the extent of language coverage or the authority of the contributors of Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World. \n\n* Extraordinary breadth of coverage: a comprehensive selection of just under 400 articles covering the world's major languages, language families, and classification structures, issues and disputes\n* Peerless quality: based on 20 years of academic development on two editions of the leading reference resource in linguistics, Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics \n* Unique authorship: 350 of the world's leading experts brought together for one purpose\n* Exceptional editorial selection, review and validation process: Keith Brown and Sarah Ogilvie act as first-tier guarantors for article quality and coverage\n* Compact and affordable: one-volume format makes this suitable for personal study at any institution interested in areal, descriptive, or comparative language study - and at a fraction of the cost of the full encyclopedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:003ed7b65e920ee5c620469ff116b627fb3b6c01","amp;dn":"Concise+Encyclopedia+of+Languages+of+the+World+%282008%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"003ed7b65e920ee5c620469ff116b627fb3b6c01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,62,215,182,94,146,14,229,198,32,70,159,241,22,182,39,251,59,108,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
