King goes from his childhood and early journalist days to his college times and stunning breakthrough, to the book's present (2004) with King recovering from a car accident and near death experience.\n\nI won't give away any of his writing advice, because he will explain it MUCH better than I ever could, so if you're interested, go ahead and download.\n\nDon't forget to seed, please!\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c859868a318b4e971f1d42870efb20fc2061922","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+On+Writing+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c859868a318b4e971f1d42870efb20fc2061922","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,133,152,104,163,24,180,233,113,241,212,40,112,239,178,15,194,6,25,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
