Walk. Write. These are the barest bones of Natalie GoldbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolutionary writing and life practice, which she presents here in book form for the first time. A whole new slant on writing that she developed since the publication of her classic Writing Down the Bones, True Secret workshops have been limited until now to small, intensive groups at a remote center in the rural Southwest. In The True Secret of Writing, Goldberg makes this popular seminar available to any reader. \n\nThe True Secret is for everyone, like eating and sleeping. It allows you to discover something real about your life, to mine the rich awareness in your mind, and to ground and empower yourself. Goldberg guides you through your own personal or group retreat, illuminating the steps of sitting in silent open mind, walking anchored to the earth, and writing without criticism. Just as Goldberg cuts through her studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resistance with her no-nonsense instructionÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shut up and writeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€the True Secret cuts to the core of realizing yourself and your world. \n\nThe capstone to forty years of teaching, The True Secret of Writing is GoldbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Zen boot camp, her legacy teaching. Stories of NatalieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own search for truth and clarity and her studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ breakthroughs and insights give moving testament to how brilliantly her unique, tough-love method works. Beautiful homages to the work of other great teachers and observers of mind, life, and love provide further secrets and inspiration to which readers will return again and again. \n\nIn her inimitable way, Goldberg will inspire you to pick up the pen, get writing, and keep going. The True Secret of Writing will help you with your writingÃ¢â‚¬â€and your life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f7b8783c233b5629c5852630ad70e32fa46f739","amp;dn":"The+True+Secret+of+Writing%3A+Connecting+Life+with+Language+by+Nat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f7b8783c233b5629c5852630ad70e32fa46f739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,123,135,131,194,51,181,98,156,88,82,99,10,215,14,50,250,70,247,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
