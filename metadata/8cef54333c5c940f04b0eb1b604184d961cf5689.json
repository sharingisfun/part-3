Thompson wrote more than thirty novels, the majority of which were original paperback publications by pulp fiction houses, from the late-1940s through mid-1950s. Despite some positive critical notice, notably by Anthony Boucher in The New York Times, he was little-recognized in his lifetime. Only after death did Thompson's literary stature grow, when in the late 1980s, several novels were re-published in the Black Lizard series of re-discovered crime fiction.\n\nNovels: (in order of year released):\n1-Now and on Earth\n2-Heed the Thunder\n3-Nothing More Than Murder\n4-The Killer Inside Me\n5-Cropper's Cabin (aka Sharecropper Hell)\n6-Recoil\n7-The Alcoholics\n8-Savage Night\n9-Bad Boy\n10-The Criminal\n11-The Golden Gizmo\n12-Roughneck\n13-A Swell-Looking Babe\n14-A Hell of a Woman\n15-The Nothing Man\n16-After Dark, My Sweet\n17-The Kill-Off\n18-Wild Town\n19-The Getaway\n20-The Transgressors\n21-The Grifters\n22-Pop. 1280\n23-Texas by the Tail\n24-South of Heaven\n27-King Blood\n28-The Rip-Off\n\nShort Stories:\nBellboy &amp; Blood From A Turnip\nForever After\nThe Car in the Mexican Quarter\nThe Cellini Chalice\nThe Flaw In The System","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cef54333c5c940f04b0eb1b604184d961cf5689","amp;dn":"Jim+Thompson+Noir+Collection+%2831+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cef54333c5c940f04b0eb1b604184d961cf5689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,239,84,51,60,92,148,15,4,176,235,27,96,65,132,217,97,207,86,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
