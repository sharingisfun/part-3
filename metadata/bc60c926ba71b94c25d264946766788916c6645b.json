This new fourth edition includes eight new chapters leading the reader through both cutting-edge topicsÃ¢â‚¬â€e.g., IBMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proposed thought-controlled sound systemÃ¢â‚¬â€and solid basics, such as loudspeaker specifications, wave equations, and digital audio.\n\nTopics covered include:\n\nPsychoacoustics and how the brain processes sound\nDigital theory\nMathematics for audio systems\nUsing the decibel\nInterfacing electrical and acoustical systems\nAudio and acoustic measurements\nLarge room and small room acoustics\nDesigning for acoustic gain\nDesigning for speech intelligibility\nWave equations\nMicrophones\nLoudspeakers, loudspeaker arrays, and loudspeaker directivity\nPower ratings for amplifiers and loudspeakers\nComputer-aided system design\nSignal delay, signal synchronization, and signal processing\nSound system equalization\nPacked with numerous illustrations and useful appendices, this is a concentrated capsule of industry standards and knowledge that spans the complete range of sound systems, from the simplest all-analog paging systems to the largest multi-purpose digital systems.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc60c926ba71b94c25d264946766788916c6645b","amp;dn":"Sound+System+Engineering+4th+Ed%2C+Davis+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc60c926ba71b94c25d264946766788916c6645b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,96,201,38,186,113,185,76,37,210,100,148,103,102,120,137,22,198,100,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
