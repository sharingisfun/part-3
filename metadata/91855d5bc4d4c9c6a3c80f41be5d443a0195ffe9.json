But with the exception of &quot;Melancholy Baby&quot; these are exactly the same kinds of bebop head charts based on blues and &quot;Rhythm&quot; chord changes that Bird had recorded at Dial and Savoy. What distinguishes the album--apart from the singularly aggressive and competitive playing of Parker and Gillespie in their last studio session--is the presence of Monk (playing Bud Powell-like lines on uncharacteristically up-tempo tunes but still unmistakably Monk) and Buddy Rich.\n\nTracklist\n1 Bloomdido  Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, 3:25 \n2 My Melancholy Baby  Buddy Rich, Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Dizzy Gillespie Charlie Parker, 3:16 \n3 Relaxin' with Lee  Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk2:47\n4 Leap Frog  Buddy Rich, Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 2:29 \n5 Oscar for Treadwell  Buddy Rich, Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 3:23 \n6 Mohawk Charlie Parker, Dizzy Charlie Parker Gillespie Quintet3:35 \n7 My Melancholy Baby Buddy Rich, Buddy Rich Thelonious Monk Curly Russell Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 3: 21\n8 Relaxin' with Lee  Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk3:53 \n9 Leap Frog Buddy Rich Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie 2:33 \n10 Leap Frog Buddy Rich Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 2:02 \n11 Leap Frog Buddy Rich,  Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 2:06 \n12 Oscar for Treadwell, Buddy Rich Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 0:21 \n13 Mohawk  Buddy Rich Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Dizzy Gillespie Charlie Parker, 3:48 \n14 Relaxin' with Lee Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk0:17 \n15 Relaxin' with Lee Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk1:08 \n16 Relaxin' with Lee Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk0:04 \n17 Relaxin' with Lee  Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk0: 27\n18 Leap Frog  Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Curly Russell, Thelonious Monk 0:26 \n19 Leap Frog Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Curly Russell, Thelonious Monk 0:14 \n20 Leap Frog Buddy Rich,  Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 0:40 \n21 Leap Frog Buddy Rich, Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie  0:18 \n22 Leap Frog Buddy Rich,  Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 0:20 \n23 Leap Frog Buddy Rich,  Curly Russell Thelonious Monk Charlie Parker Dizzy Gillespie, 0:18 \n24 Leap Frog Buddy Rich,  Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Curly Russell, Thelonious Monk 0:41\n\nRecorded in New York, New York on June 6, 1950\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91855d5bc4d4c9c6a3c80f41be5d443a0195ffe9","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+and+Dizzy+Gillespie+Bird+and+Diz+%28jazz%29%28mp3%40320%29%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91855d5bc4d4c9c6a3c80f41be5d443a0195ffe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,133,93,91,196,212,201,198,163,200,15,65,190,93,68,58,1,149,255,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
