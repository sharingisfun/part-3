They are the best of the best, chosen for their superior skills in each discipline of warfare. And to lead his secret Highland Guard, Bruce chooses the greatest warrior of all.\n\nThe ultimate Highland warlord and a swordsman without equal, Tor MacLeod has no intention of being drawn into ScotlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war against the English. Dedicated to his clan, the fiercely independent chief answers to no oneÃ¢â‚¬â€especially not to his alluring new bride, bartered to him in a bid to secure his command of the deadliest fighting force the world has ever seen. The treacherous chit who made her way to TorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bed may have won his hand, but she will never claim his heart.\n\nAlthough her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation is as fierce as his manner, Christina Fraser believes that something softer hides beneath his brutal shell. But the only warmth she feels is in their bed, in glorious moments of white-hot desire that disappear with the dawn. When ChristinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reckless bid to win her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love goes awry and thrusts them into danger on the eve of war, Tor will face his ultimate battle: to save his wife and to open his heartÃ¢â‚¬â€before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late.\n\nThe Hawk (Highland Guard, #2)\nErik MacSorley is a brilliant seafarer who has never encountered a wind he could not harness or a woman he could not winÃ¢â‚¬â€until he drags a wet, half-naked Ã¢â‚¬Å“nursemaidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ out of the waters off the Irish coast. EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ordinary appearance belies the truth: She is in fact Lady Elyne de Burgh, the spirited daughter of the most powerful noble in Ireland. Worse, this irresistible woman is determined to prove herself immune to ErikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charmsÃ¢â‚¬â€a challenge he cannot resist.\n\nHer captor may look every inch a rugged warrior, but Ellie vows that it will take more than a wickedly suggestive caress to impress her. Yet Erik will sweep away EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resistance with a desire that resonates deep within her heart. Still, he is a man driven by loyalty, and she is a woman with secrets that could jeopardize BruceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chance to reclaim his throne. As the battle for king and country sounds across the shores, will EllieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love be enough to finally tame the legend known as the Hawk?\n\nThe Ranger (Highland Guard, #3)\nEmbedded deep behind enemy lines, Arthur Ã¢â‚¬Å“RangerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Campbell is prized for his razor-sharp senses and his ability to blend into the shadows.

Imprisoned with barbaric cruelty, she vows to reclaim her child, even if it means selling her soulÃ¢â‚¬â€and her bodyÃ¢â‚¬â€to a dark, lethal warrior whose eyes glint like steel, but who makes her skin tingle and her breath race. Together they embark on a rogue mission with sinister twists and turns that threatens not only BellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gamble to save her daughterÃ¢â‚¬â€but also her heart.\n\nThe Saint (Highland Guard, #5)\nMagnus MacKay is the ultimate Highlander: tough, proud, able to master any terrain and to best his enemies. Called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the SaintÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for his refusal to discuss women, as well as for his cool and steady leadership, Magnus hides a painful truth. It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t virtue or piety that keeps him silent, but a wound of love and loss that cuts so deep he cannot bear to speak of it. But when the woman who refused him is betrothed to his friend and fellow Guardsman, Magnus is tested by loveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battle cry.\n \nA wild and innocent beauty, Helen chose family duty over her desire for Magnus.
