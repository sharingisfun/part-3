His personal reminiscences illuminate universal truths Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the complexity of relationships, the passage of time and the importance of family and community Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to form an affecting, complex parable for our modern times. \n\nThe play, in which Sting has been creatively immersed for nearly three years, debuts on Broadway in 2014 and is a collaboration with Tony Award winners Joe Mantello (director; Wicked, Other Desert Cities), John Logan (writer; Red, Skyfall) and Brian Yorkey (writer; Next to Normal).&quot;The Last Ship&quot; tells the story of the demise of the shipbuilding industry in 1980s Newcastle which had, for so long, shaped and overshadowed the city, its development, and its community. \n\n&quot;The Last Ship&quot; album is produced by Rob Mathes (Sting, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Lou Reed, Carly Simon) and engineered and mixed by Donal Hodgson. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cc6c184e290e734e4c36ee68ab43f471988fb93","amp;dn":"Sting+-+The+Last+Ship+%282013%29+2013+Album+%40+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cc6c184e290e734e4c36ee68ab43f471988fb93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,198,193,132,226,144,231,52,228,195,110,230,138,180,63,71,25,136,251,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
